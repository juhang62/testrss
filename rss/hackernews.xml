However, to comply with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent order from the U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;, Google pulled the Chinese tech company and smartphone manufacturer Huawei’s license to use the proprietary Google software that sits on top of Android. In doing so, Google quietly exposed the powerful control it has over its supposedly open phone ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6804&quot; id=&quot;6804&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most Android manufacturers — including Huawei — are what’s known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google hardware partners&lt;/a&gt;. This relationship lets them build their phones around a collection of Google products, from apps like Google Maps and Assistant, to under-the-hood tools like location services or push notifications. While Google gives off the impression that Android is open and available to everyone, these services represent a quiet control that the company doesn’t often enforce over its hardware partners — though, as it has now proven, it certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d20b&quot; id=&quot;d20b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the recent order, the U.S. government forced Google’s hand. The U.S. Department of Commerce put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huawei on the “Entity List,”&lt;/a&gt; which blocks it from buying technology from U.S. companies without government approval. Huawei and Google now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have three months&lt;/a&gt; to send updates to existing users. For new phones, Huawei &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may be able to&lt;/a&gt; use the open-source version of Android, but it can’t be a Google partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;142e&quot; id=&quot;142e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The distinction between using Android and being a Google partner seems messy from the outside, but “Android” technically refers to the core operating system that covers basic things like making phone calls or using the camera. The freely available version of Android is called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and a company doesn’t have to be a partner to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;601c&quot; id=&quot;601c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most manufacturers like Huawei, however, do choose to become a Google partner. That means Huawei agrees to only make devices that use a collection of Google apps known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Mobile Services&lt;/a&gt; which includes things like Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play Store. Under this arrangement, Huawei can’t, for example, make a phone that ships with Microsoft’s Bing and Edge instead of Google Search and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;424f&quot; id=&quot;424f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1024&quot; id=&quot;1024&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Partners also have to meet certain security and compatibility conditions. In exchange, they get access to all of Google’s apps and infrastructure, making their phones much more appealing to customers worldwide than they would otherwise be. This arrangement is usually free, though manufacturers who sell in the EU &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pay a fee&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exempt from the all-or-nothing condition&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complicated legal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da87&quot; id=&quot;da87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to Bryan Pon, PhD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mobile platform researcher&lt;/a&gt; and co-founder of the data analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caribou Data&lt;/a&gt;, this gives Google a lot of control over its platform. “Consumers are attached to the Google products and services that sit on top of the operating system,” explains Pon. “Google has very strong proprietary control over those, and in that sense wields tremendous power, irrespective of the operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe56&quot; id=&quot;fe56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Additionally, Huawei, and Google’s other partners, have to include a collection of developer tools called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Play Services&lt;/a&gt;. These background tools let app developers easily do things like create push notifications, embed maps in their apps, or get a GPS location. Most Android apps distributed through the Google Play Store rely on some of these tools to provide features that are too expensive or difficult for every developer to build themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71f1&quot; id=&quot;71f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Pon explains, some of these tools are crucial features that would normally be part of an operating system. “They’re actually taking functionality out of the core platform,” Pon says. “They’re leaving Android open source, more and more, just a shell. And that core functionality is now part of just proprietary Google services.” Google does this to make it easier to update important features without waiting for a big Android update, but the result consolidates Google’s power over its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4efe&quot; id=&quot;4efe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Without Google Play Services, Huawei would have to build these tools itself or leave developers to do it. The company has created its own version of some of these features — like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;push notification service&lt;/a&gt; — but developers still have to add support for Huawei’s version of the tools to their apps in order for them to work on non-Google phones. Huawei is building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own app store alternative&lt;/a&gt;, but it could take a long time to build everything else that developers and users are accustomed to getting from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;733b&quot; id=&quot;733b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous. One of the few companies to opt out of Google’s system was Amazon with its series of Fire Tablets. If you buy a Fire, you’ll have something similar to an Android experience, but with hardly a trace of Google. Instead, you’ll use the Amazon Appstore. You’ll talk to Alexa instead of the Google Assistant. You’ll use Amazon’s Silk Browser instead of Chrome. Under the hood, all your apps will be using Amazon’s version of key features, like notifications or GPS. The approach works fine enough for a tablet, but when Amazon tried to make a phone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it failed miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d269&quot; id=&quot;d269&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Samsung tries to walk a middle ground, offering parallel versions of almost everything Google makes, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basic email apps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own voice assistant&lt;/a&gt;, without breaking away from its partner agreement. But if Samsung were to find itself in Huawei’s shoes, even that might not be enough. “I think to some extent, Samsung has to tell itself that it… has a plan B,” says Pon. “But I think, realistically, if they get turned off, like Huawei might get turned off, then they don’t have any good options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4438&quot; id=&quot;4438&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Under normal circumstances, this symbiotic relationship benefits everyone involved and lends credibility to Google’s claim that Android — unlike the iPhone — is “open,” while still letting the company maintain as much control over Android as possible. If a company like Amazon wants to build its own alternative from scratch, it can. For companies like Samsung and Huawei that can’t afford to or aren’t willing to go that far, they can leverage Google’s massive resources to make a variation of Android that consumers will want, without deviating too far from Google’s master plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c48&quot; id=&quot;4c48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, barring relief in the brewing China-U.S. trade war, Huawei has been forcibly pushed into going the much harder Amazon route. Huawei can’t use Google apps, it can’t support the push notifications or location services most apps use, and it even has to wait longer for security updates before it can push them to users. Existing users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;won’t be affected for now&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the temporary license granted by the U.S. Commerce Department, but future plans look grim. It took Amazon years to build its own version of Google’s services. Huawei’s CEO says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the company has a plan&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how long that plan could take to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9752&quot; id=&quot;9752&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, for Huawei, it’s not all bad news. The Google Play Store has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned in China for years&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the country’s Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; that censors many foreign sites and services including Google search, Facebook, or YouTube. Losing them is of little importance in the Chinese market, which makes up &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;52% of the company’s overall revenue&lt;/a&gt;. Outside China, on the other hand, Huawei stands to lose quite a lot. Globally, it’s hard to sell an Android phone without Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;32e2&quot; id=&quot;32e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb1c&quot; id=&quot;fb1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Beyond Huawei’s problems — and beyond the reality that geopolitics will play an increasing role in the tech business — this situation reveals a truth that Google has downplayed for years. While Android — the stripped down, open-source operating system — may be available to everyone, all of the Google pieces that make most Android phones worthwhile are locked behind a partner program. Google might let almost everyone into its exclusive club, but it reserves the right to kick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f2f9&quot; id=&quot;f2f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Even if we could assume the best about Google’s intentions to keep Android as open as possible — and Google did not respond to a request by &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; for comment — the Huawei order demonstrates that Google’s control can be abused by other entities. If the U.S. were in a trade war with South Korea instead of China, Samsung phones — still the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; in the world over — could face a similar fate. Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The shittiest project I ever worked on (2013)</title>
<link>https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;storytitle&quot; name=&quot;prudential&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html&quot; id=&quot;prudential&quot;&gt;The shittiest project I ever worked on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in job interviews I've been asked to describe a project I worked on that failed. This is the one I always think of first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995 I quit my regular job as senior web engineer for Time-Warner and became a consultant developing interactive content for the World-Wide Web, which was still a pretty new thing at the time. Time-Warner taught me many things. One was that many large companies are not single organizations; they are much more like a bunch of related medium-sized companies that all share a building and a steam plant. (Another was that I didn't like being part of a large company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my early clients was Prudential, which is a large life insurance, real estate, and financial services conglomerate based in Newark, New Jersey—another fine example of a large company that actually turned out to be a bunch of medium-sized companies sharing a single building. I did a number of projects for them, one of which was to produce an online directory of Prudential-affiliated real estate brokers. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this sort of thing by now. The idea was that you would visit a form on their web site, put in your zip code or town name, and it would extract the nearby brokers from a database and present them to you on a web page, ordered by distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project really sucked, partly because Prudential was disorganized and bureaucratic, and partly because I didn't know what I was doing. I quoted a flat fee for the job, assuming that it would be straightforward and that I had a good idea of what was required. But I hadn't counted on bureaucratic pettifoggery and the need for every layer of the management hierarchy to stir the soup a little. They tweaked and re-tweaked every little thing. The data set they delivered was very dirty, much of it garbled or incomplete, and they kept having to fix their exporting process, which they did incompletely, several times. They also changed their minds at least once about which affiliated real estate agencies should be in the results, and had to re-send a new data set with the new correct subset of affiliates, and then the new data would be garbled or incomplete. So I received replacement data six or seven times. This would not have been a problem, except that each time they presented me with a file in a somewhat different format, probably exported from some loser's constantly-evolving Excel spreadsheet. So I had to write seven or eight different versions of the program that validated and loaded the data. These days I would handle this easily; after the first or second iteration I would explain the situation: I had based my estimate on certain expectations of how much work would be required; I had not expected to clean up dirty data in eight different formats; they had the choice of delivering clean data in the same format as before, renegotiating the fee, or finding someone else to do the project. But in 1995 I was too green to do this, and I did the extra work for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, they tweaked the output format of the program repeatedly over weeks: first the affiliates should be listed in distance order, but no, they should be listed alphabetically if they are in the same town and then after that the ones from other towns, grouped by town; no, the Prudential Preferred affiliates must be listed first regardless of distance, which necessitated a redelivery of the data which up until then hadn't distinguished between ordinary and Preferred affiliates; no wait, that doesn't make sense, it puts a far-off Preferred affiliate ahead of a nearby regular affiliate... again, this is something that many clients do, but I wasn't expecting it and it took a lot of time I hadn't budgeted for. Also these people had, I now know, an unusually bad case of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we finally got it just right, and it had been approved by multiple layers of management and given a gold star by the Compliance Department, and my clients took it to the Prudential Real Estate people for a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall that Prudential is actually a bunch of medium-sized companies that share a building in Newark. The people I was working with were part of one of these medium-sized companies. The real estate business people were in a different company. The report I got about the demo was that the real estate people loved it, it was just what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But,” they said, “how do we collect the referral fees?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Real Estate is a franchise operation. Prudential does not actually broker any real estate. Instead, a local franchisee pays a fee for the use of the name and logo and other services. One of the other services is that Prudential runs a national toll-free number; you can call this up and they will refer you to a nearby affiliate who will help you buy or sell real estate. And for each such referral, the affiliate pays Prudential a referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had put together a real estate affiliate locator application which let you locate a nearby Prudential-affiliated franchisee and contact them directly, bypassing the referral and eliminating Prudential's opportunity to collect a referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was told to make one final change to the affiliate locator. It now worked like this: The user would enter their town or zip code; the application would consult the database and find the contact information for the nearby affiliates, it would order them in the special order dictated by the Compliance Department, and then it would display a web page with the addresses and phone numbers of the affiliates carefully suppressed. Instead, the name of each affiliate would be followed by the Prudential national toll-free number AND NOTHING ELSE. Even the names were suspect. For a while Prudential considered replacing each affiliate's name with a canned string, something like &quot;Prudential Real Estate Affiliate&quot;, because what if the web user decided to look up the affiliate in the Yellow Pages and call them directly? It was eventually decided that the presence of the toll-free number directly underneath rendered this risk acceptably small, so the names stayed. But everything else was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Prudential didn't need an affiliate locator application. They needed a static HTML page that told people to call the number. All the work I had put into importing the data, into formatting the output, into displaying the realtors in precisely the right order, had been a complete waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;KEEPING SPACE CLEAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;Starlink is on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;At end of life, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event the propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>H.264 is Magic (2016)</title>
<link>https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a video compression codec standard. It is ubiquitous - internet video, Blu-ray, phones, security cameras, drones, everything. Everything uses H.264 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a remarkable piece of technology. It is the result of 30+ years of work with one single goal: To reduce the bandwidth required for transmission of full-motion video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, it is very interesting. This post will give insight into some of the details at a high level - I hope to not bore you too much with the intricacies. Also note that many of the concepts explained here apply to video compression in general, and not just H.264.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why even compress anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple uncompressed video file will contain an array of 2D buffers containing pixel data for each frame. So it's a 3D (2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal) array of bytes. Each pixel takes 3 bytes to store - one byte each for the three primary colors (red, green and blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1080p @ 60 Hz = 1920x1080x60x3 =&amp;gt; ~&lt;strong&gt;370 MB/sec&lt;/strong&gt; of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is next to impossible to deal with. A 50GB Blu-ray disk will only hold ~2 mins. You can't move it anywhere fast. Even SSDs have trouble dumping this straight from RAM to Disk&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. We need compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;H.264&lt;/em&gt; compression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I will answer this. But first let me show you something. Here is the Apple Homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/HomePage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured the screen of this home page and produced two files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eh. What? Those file sizes look switched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they're right. The H.264 video, 300 frames long is 175KB. A single frame of that video in PNG is 1015KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we're storing 300 times the amount of data in the video. But the file size is a fifth. So H.264 would seem to be 1500x as efficient as PNG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this even possible? All right, what's the trick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many tricks! H.264 uses all the tricks you can think of (and tons you can't think of). Let's go through the important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;sheddingweight&quot;&gt;Shedding weight&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're building a car for street racing. You need to go faster. What is the first thing you do? You shed some weight. Your car weighs 3000 lbs. You throw away stuff you don't need. Those back seats? pfft. Chuck those. That subwoofer? Gone. No music for you. Air Conditioning? Yeah, ditch it. Transmission? Ye..no. Wait! We're gonna need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remove everything except the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept of throwing away bits you don't need to save space is called &lt;strong&gt;lossy&lt;/strong&gt; compression. H.264 is a lossy codec - it throws away less important bits and only keeps the important bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNG is a &lt;strong&gt;lossless&lt;/strong&gt; codec. It means that nothing is thrown away. Bit for bit, the original source image can be recovered from a PNG encoded image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important bits? How does the algorithm know what bits in my frame are important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few obvious ways to trim out images. Maybe the top right quadrant is useless all the time. So maybe we can zero out those pixels and discard that quadrant. We would use only 3/4th of the space we need. ~2200 lbs now. Or maybe we can crop out a thick border around the edges of the frame, the important stuff is in the middle anyway. Yes, you could do these. But H.264 doesn't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does H.264 actually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264, like other lossy image algorithms, discards detail information. Here is a close-up of the original compared with the image post-discard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/CompressedImage-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how the compressed one does not show the holes in the speaker grills in the MacBook Pro? If you don't zoom in, you would even notice the difference. The image on the right weighs in at &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt; the size of the original - and we haven't even compressed the image in the traditional sense. Imagine your car weighed just 200 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7% wow! How do you discard detail information like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we need a quick math lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;informationentropy&quot;&gt;Information Entropy&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting to the juicy bits! Ha puns! If you took an information theory class, you might remember information entropy. Information entropy is the number of bits required to represent some information. Note that it is not simply the size of some dataset. It is minimum number of bits that must be used to represent all the information contained in a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your dataset is the result of a single coin toss, you need 1 bit of entropy. If you have record two coin tosses, you'll need 2 bits. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have some strange coin - you've tossed it 10 times, and every time it lands on heads. How would you describe this information to someone? You wouldn't say HHHHHHHHH. You would just say &quot;10 tosses, all heads&quot; - bam! You've just compressed some data! Easy. I saved you hours of mindfuck lectures. This is obviously an oversimplification, but you've transformed some data into another shorter representation of the same information. You've reduced data &lt;strong&gt;redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;. The information entropy in this dataset has not changed - you've just converted between representations. This type of encoder is called an &lt;strong&gt;entropy encoder&lt;/strong&gt; - it's a general-purpose lossless encoder that works for any type of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;frequencydomain&quot;&gt;Frequency Domain&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand information entropy, let's move on to transformations of data. You can represent data in some fundamental units. If you use binary, you have 0 and 1. If you use hex, you have 16 characters. You can easily transform between the two systems. They are essentially equivalent. So far so good? Ok!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some imagination! Imagine you can transform any dataset that varies over space(or time) - something like the brightness value of an image, into a different coordinate space. So instead of x-y coordinates, let's say we have frequency coordinates. freqX and freqY are the axes now. This is called a &lt;strong&gt;frequency domain&lt;/strong&gt; representation. There is another mindfuck mathematical theorem&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that states that you can do this for any data and you can achieve a perfect lossless transformation as long as freqX and freqY are high enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but what the freq are freqX and freqY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freqX and freqY are some other set of basis units. Just like when we switch from binary to hex, we have a different fundamental unit, we're switching from the familiar X-Y to freqX and freqY. Hex 'A' looks different from binary '1010'. Both mean the same thing, but &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; different. So here is what our image looks like in the frequency domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/BasicFFT-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine grill on that MacBook pro has a high information content in the higher frequency components of that image. Finely varying content = high frequency components. Any sort of gradual variation in the color and brightness - such as gradients are low frequency components of that image. Anything in between falls in between. So fine details = high freq. Gentle gradients = low freq. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the frequency domain representation, the low frequency components are near the center of that image. The higher frequency components are towards of the edges of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Kinda makes sense. But why do all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now, you can take that frequency domain image and then mask out the edges - discard information which will contain the information with high frequency components. Now if you convert back to your regular x-y coordinates, you'll find that the resulting image looks similar to the original but has lost some of the fine details. But now, the image only occupies a fraction of the space. By controlling how big your mask is, you can now tune precisely how detailed you want your output images to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the close-up of the laptop in the home page again. Except now, there is a circular border mask that's been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/QuantizationHorizontalWithMasks-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers represent the information entropy of that image as a fraction of the original. Even at 2%, you won't notice the difference unless you're at this zoom level. 2%! - your car now weighs 60 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's how you shed weight. This process in lossy compression is called &lt;strong&gt;quantization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Impressive, I guess. What else you got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;chromasubsampling&quot;&gt;Chroma Subsampling.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human/eye brain system is not very good at resolving finer details in color. It can detect minor variations in brightness very easily but not color. So there must be some way to discard color information to shed even more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a TV signal, R+G+B color data gets transformed to Y+Cb+Cr. The Y is the luminance (essentially black and white brightness) and the Cb and Cr are the chrominance (color) components. RGB and YCbCr are equivalent in terms of information entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why unnecessarily complicate? RGB not good enough for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back before we had color TV, we only had the Y signal. And when color TVs just started coming along, engineers had to figure out a way to transmit RGB color along with Y. Instead of using two separate data streams, they wisely decided to encode the color information into Cb and Cr and transmit that along with the Y information. That way, BW TVs would only look at the Y component. Color TVs will, in addition, look at the chrominance components and convert to RGB internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But check out the trick: the Y component gets encoded at full resolution. The C components only at a quarter resolution. Since the eye/brain is terrible at detecting color variations, you can get away with this. By doing this, you reduce total bandwidth by one half, with very little visual difference. Half! Your car now weighs 30 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of discarding some of the color information is called &lt;strong&gt;Chroma Subsampling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While not specific to H.264 and has been around for decades itself, it is used almost universally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the big weight shedders for lossy compression. Our frames are now tiny - since we discarded most of the detail information and half of the color information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. That's it? Can we do something more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Weight shedding is only the first step. So far we're only looking at the spatial domains within a single frame. Now it's time to explore temporal compression - where we look at a group of frames across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;motioncompensation&quot;&gt;Motion compensation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a motion compensation compression standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion compensation? What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're watching a tennis match. The camera is fixed at a certain angle. The only thing moving is the ball back and forth. How would you encode this information? You do what you always do, right? You have a 3D array of pixels, two dimensions in space and one in time. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah. Why would you? Most of the image is the same anyway. The court, the net, the crowds, all are static. The only real action is the ball moving. What if you could just have one static image of everything in the background, and then one moving image of just the ball? Wouldn't that save a lot of space? You see where I am going with this? Get it? See where I am going? Motion estimation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lame jokes aside, this is exactly what H.264 does. H.264 splits up the image into macro-blocks - typically 16x16 pixel blocks that it will use for motion estimation. It encodes one static image - typically called an &lt;strong&gt;I-frame&lt;/strong&gt;(Intra frame). This is a full frame - containing all the bits it required to construct that frame. And then subsequent frames are either &lt;strong&gt;P-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(predicted) or &lt;strong&gt;B-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(bi-directionally predicted). P-frames are frames that will encode a motion vector for each of the macro-blocks from the previous frame. So a P-frame has to be constructed by the decoder based on previous frames. It starts with the last I-frame in the video stream and then walks through every subsequent frame - adding up the motion vector deltas as it goes along until it arrives at the current frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-frames are even more interesting, where the prediction happens bi-directionally, both from past frames and from future frames. So you can imagine now why that Apple home page video is so well compressed. Because it's really just three I-frames in which the macro blocks are being panned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you've been playing a video on YouTube. You missed the last few seconds of dialog, so you scrub back a few seconds. Have you noticed that it doesn't instantly start playing from that timecode you just selected. It pauses for a few moments and then plays. It's already buffered those frames from the network, since you just played it, so why that pause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah that annoys the shit out of me. Why does it do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you've asked the decoder to jump to some arbitrary frame, the decoder has to redo all the calculations - starting from the nearest I-frames and adding up the motion vector deltas to the frame you're on - and this is computationally expensive, and hence the brief pause. Hopefully you'll be less annoyed now, knowing it's actually doing hard work and not just sitting around just to annoy you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you're only encoding motion vectors deltas, this technique is extremely space-efficient for any video with motion, at the cost of some computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we've covered both spatial and temporal compression! So far we have a shitton of space saved in Quantization. Chroma subsampling further halved the space required. On top of that, we have motion compensation that stores only 3 actual frames for the ~300 that we had in that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good to me. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we wrap up and seal the deal. We use a traditional lossless entropy encoder. Because why not? Let's just slap that on there for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;entropycoder&quot;&gt;Entropy Coder&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I-frames, after the lossy steps, contain redundant information. The motion vectors for each of the macro blocks in the P and B-frames - there are entire groups of them with the same values - since several macro blocks move by the same amount when the image pans in our test video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entropy encoder will take care of this redundancy. And since it is a general purpose lossless encoder, we don't have to worry about what tradeoffs it's making. We can recover all the data that goes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we're done! At the core of it, this is how video compression codecs like H.264 work. These are its tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok great! But I am curious to know how much our car weighs now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original video was captured at an odd resolution of 1232x1154. If we apply the math here, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 secs @ 60 fps = 1232x1154x60x3x5 =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1.2 GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compressed video =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;175 KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we apply the same ratio to our 3000 lb car, we get &lt;strong&gt;0.4 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; as the final weight. 6.5 ounces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. It's magic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I am massively oversimplifying several decades of intense research in this field. If you want to know more, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Page&lt;/a&gt; is pretty descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-brings-you-smooth-video-playback-with-the-worlds-fastest-av1-decoder/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/05/21/latest-firefox-release-is-faster-than-ever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;release of Firefox 67&lt;/a&gt; brought a number of performance enhancing features that make this our fastest browser ever.  Among these is the high performance, royalty free AV1 video decoder &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dav1d&lt;/a&gt;, now enabled by default on all desktop platforms (Windows, OSX and Linux) for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With files more than 30% smaller than today’s most popular web codec VP9 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/video-engineering/av1-beats-x264-and-libvpx-vp9-in-practical-use-case/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;], and nearly 50% smaller than its widely deployed predecessor H.264 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/hevc_2018/pdf/MSU_HEVC_AV1_comparison_2018_P4_HQ_encoders.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], AV1 allows high-quality video experiences with a lot less network usage, and has the potential to transform how and where we watch video on the Internet. However, because AV1 is brand new and more sophisticated, some experts had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multichannel.com/news/hardware-support-big-step-ahead-av1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that market adoption would wait until 2020 when high-performance hardware decoders are expected.  Dav1d in the browser upends these predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alliance for Open Media&lt;/a&gt;, dav1d is a joint effort between the French non-profit VideoLAN and the greater FFmpeg open source audio/video community.  Some of the leading minds in open source multimedia joined forces to release the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2018/First-release-of-dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; version of dav1d last fall, already 2x to 5x faster than &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/&quot;&gt;libaom&lt;/a&gt;, the reference decoder published by AOMedia as part of the AV1 standards effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33514&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the dav1d developers have squeezed out even more performance by profiling and rewriting critical sections in highly-parallelized SIMD assembly. And this shows in the benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33521&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;694&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher performance and greater efficiency means smooth playback of AV1 video in the browser with significantly less CPU utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AV1 already seeing adoption on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing dav1d in Firefox could not have happened at a better time.  In just the past few months we’ve seen remarkable growth in the use of AV1, with our latest figures showing that 11.8% of video playback in Firefox Beta used AV1, up from 3% in March and 0.85% in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33518&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;987&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-250x155.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-768x476.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that desktop Firefox contains dav1d, we expect even more websites will take advantage of this next-generation, royalty-free video codec AV1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mozilla investing in the AV1 future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art decoders like dav1d are great for video playback, but best-in-class, free and open source software &lt;em&gt;en&lt;/em&gt;coders are equally important to a healthy AV1 community.  The AOMedia reference encoder was developed with the goal of creating the AV1 standard, not a production encoder.  Thus, Mozilla and Xiph.Org are jointly developing a clean-room encoder named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiph/rav1e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rav1e&lt;/a&gt; (the Rust AV1 Encoder) to increase encoding gains over the reference encoder and allow software encoding fast enough for real-time applications like WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good encoders make heavy use of psychovisual models to allocate bits for what humans perceive as good visual quality (not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PSNR&lt;/a&gt;).  With rav1e we are applying the perceptual analysis expertise from our earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.xiph.org/index.php?title=Daala&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Daala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Theora&lt;/a&gt; codec development efforts to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/pvq_demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;activity masking&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/barrbrain/9d541d809d1d664460b5ce5c00a57948/Chroma%20quantizer%20balance.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;color balancing&lt;/a&gt;, improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo8.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rate control&lt;/a&gt; and perceptual distortion metrics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CDEF&lt;/a&gt; that bring new, improved quality to AV1 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also investing considerable research to improve encoder speed, optimizing new techniques that appear for the first time in AV1.  It’s not enough to rewrite existing code from the initial reference encoder in SIMD assembly and make it four times faster. Rav1e is developing ways to make AV1 encoding tools 1000x faster by finding new algorithms rather than simply optimizing existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rav1e is getting better all the time.  Active development continues at a rapid pace, landing major new improvements weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find video compression and related technologies fascinating?  Then join us in New York on June 26 for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigapple.video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Big Apple Video 2019&lt;/a&gt; conference co-hosted by Mozilla and Vimeo.  This full day event focuses on cutting edge video technologies and the user experiences they enable.  With speakers from Twitch, Cisco, NGCodec, Intel, Wikimedia and other well known companies, this conference is designed for video technology enthusiasts like you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d love to have you with us in New York, but if not you can register to attend remotely and watch our on-line video stream.  What else would you expect from a conference on video and related technologies?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Posting Guidelines v3.5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/gamedev&quot;&gt;/r/gamedev&lt;/a&gt; is a game development community for developer-oriented content. We hope to promote discussion and a sense of community among game developers on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback requests&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Play my game&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/wiki/good_posts&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about your game or use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/7fpqqu/weekly_threads_101_making_good_use_of_rgamedev/&quot;&gt;weekly threads&lt;/a&gt; to trade feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Offers, Recruiting, and related activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedevclassifieds&quot;&gt;/r/gamedevclassifieds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT&quot;&gt;/r/INAT&lt;/a&gt; for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once-per-game feedback requests or release threads are OK, but a considerable history of participation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev&quot;&gt;/r/gamedev&lt;/a&gt; is required. Must be a Text Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devlogs&lt;/strong&gt; that do not have a focus on being useful to other developers. Do not talk about what advancements occurred on your game this week. That is what Feedback Friday, Screenshot Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/devblogs&quot;&gt;/r/devblogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedevscreens&quot;&gt;/r/gamedevscreens&lt;/a&gt; are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Explicitly On Topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamedev-relevant Articles, Videos, and Announcements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Assets&lt;/strong&gt; (please specify license)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMAs&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a unique perspective on something, we'd love to hear it. This is not a way to promote your game/kickstarter/etc, please see above. The focus should be on providing info to the community, not promoting yourself. Be sure to include your education and years of experience to provide some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use [tags]&lt;/strong&gt;, assign flair to your post after it's created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question posts...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should include what you've already tried and why it was inadequate. Be sure to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/wiki/faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Text Submission Length&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 words or so. That's about two tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveys and polls...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should have their results shared with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Assets...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should have a proper license included in the post itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please include images/samples in your post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Share Your Stuff&quot; threads...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should have the OP posting in the comments alongside everyone else, if they post.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When we say “Everest is crowded,” this is what we mean</title>
<link>https://www.outsideonline.com/2397164/everest-summit-traffic-jam</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.outsideonline.com/2397164/everest-summit-traffic-jam</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, American climber Don Cash died on Everest hours after he had reached the summit. As Alan Arnette &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/2397116/american-don-cash-dies-everest&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;reported for &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cash was one of about 200 people who went to the top of the world that day, and he encountered a traffic jam on his way down. “When Cash and his Sherpa guides got to the Hillary Step they were forced to wait their turn for at least two hours,” wrote Arnette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we can better understand what that traffic jam looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climber Nirmal Purja posted this photo on Facebook early on May 23. It shows a dense line of climbers on their way to the Hillary Step and then the summit. “I summited everest at 5:30 am and lhotse 3:45 pm despite of [sic] the heavy traffic (roughly 320 people),” wrote Purja, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/147-power-of-possible?fbclid=IwAR0OCun8s_hGTjNDJ6zmMeYxqQMooN5l_JxG-WfHrwDEWQklgtVyZ3Y1yQc&quot;&gt;who is currently attempting&lt;/a&gt; to climb all 14 of the Himalayas' 8,000-meter peaks in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo was quickly disseminated by other social media users who couldn’t believe what it depicted, with comments like “I can't believe this photo from Mount Everest 2019 is real, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexheard/status/1131603603993419777&quot;&gt;but apparently it is&lt;/a&gt;,” and “this looks like a lot of fun and totally normal and&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EveningSends/status/1131544038597726208&quot;&gt; not at all fucked&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be the most iconic modern Everest photo since 2012, when Ralf Dujmovits captured another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/1915676/photo-captured-2012-climbing-season&quot;&gt;“conga line” of climbers ascending the Lhotse Face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first evidence of serious crowding seen on the mountain this season; on April 19, a photo of climbers queued up in the Khumbu Icefall also sparked surprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arnette previously reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/2393183/mount-everest-2019-preview&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;a record number of people&lt;/a&gt; are climbing Everest this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/1929346/forecasting-everest&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;intense jet stream&lt;/a&gt; that hovers near Everest’s 29,029-foot summit for much of the year, there are only a few weather windows, often two or three days in late May, when it's optimal for climbers to make a push for the top—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/1813511/summit-weather-windows-everest-too-narrow-safety&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;forcing many expeditions&lt;/a&gt; to all go for it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing Rust 1.35.0</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/05/23/Rust-1.35.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/05/23/Rust-1.35.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.35.0. Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.35.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot;&gt;$ rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.35.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in 1.35.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of this release is the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FnMut&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; closure traits for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnMut&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Additionally, closures may now be coerced to unsafe function pointers. The &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html#the-dbg-macro&quot;&gt;Rust 1.32.0&lt;/a&gt; can now also be called without arguments. Moreover, there were a number of standard library stabilizations. Read on for a few highlights, or see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fn*&lt;/code&gt; closure traits implemented for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn*&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.35.0, the &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FnMut&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; traits &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55431&quot;&gt;are now implemented&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnMut&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, if you wanted to call the function stored in a boxed closure, you had to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.34.0/std/boxed/trait.FnBox.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FnBox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This was because instances of &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and friends did not implement the respective &lt;code&gt;Fn*&lt;/code&gt; traits. This also meant that it was not possible to pass boxed functions to code expecting an implementor of a &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; trait, and you had to create temporary closures to pass them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was ultimately due to a limitation in the compiler's ability to reason about such implementations, which has since been fixed with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/unsized-locals.html&quot;&gt;unsized locals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, you can now use boxed functions in places that expect items implementing a function trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code now works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo(x: Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn(u8) -&amp;gt; u8&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt; {
    vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_iter().map(x).collect()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you can now directly call &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo(x: Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce()&amp;gt;) {
    x()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coercing closures to &lt;code&gt;unsafe fn&lt;/code&gt; pointers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/07/20/Rust-1.19.html&quot;&gt;Rust 1.19.0&lt;/a&gt;, it has been possible to coerce closures that do not capture from their environment into function pointers. For example, you may write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn twice(x: u8, f: fn(u8) -&amp;gt; u8) -&amp;gt; u8 {
    f(f(x))
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(42, twice(0, |x| x + 21));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has however not extended to &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; function pointers. With this release of Rust, you may now do so. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;/// The safety invariants are those of the `unsafe fn` pointer passed.
unsafe fn call_unsafe_fn_ptr(f: unsafe fn()) {
    f()
}

fn main() {
    // SAFETY: There are no invariants.
    // The closure is statically prevented from doing unsafe things.
    unsafe {
        call_unsafe_fn_ptr(|| {
            dbg!();
        });
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calling &lt;code&gt;dbg!()&lt;/code&gt; with no argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of all the occasional and frequent &quot;print debuggers&quot; out there, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html#the-dbg-macro&quot;&gt;Rust 1.32.0&lt;/a&gt; saw the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/a&gt;. To recap, the macro allows you to quickly inspect the value of some expression with context. For example, when running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;

    if dbg!(x == 1) {
        x += 1;
    }

    dbg!(x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...you would see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[src/main.rs:4] x == 1 = false
[src/main.rs:8] x = 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen in the previous section, where the higher order function &lt;code&gt;call_unsafe_fn_ptr&lt;/code&gt; is called, you may now also call &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; without passing any arguments. This is useful when tracing what branches your application takes. For example, with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    if condition {
        dbg!();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...you would see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[src/main.rs:5]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1.35.0, a number of APIs have become stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, some implementations were added and other changes occured as well. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copy the sign of a floating point number onto another&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, new methods &lt;code&gt;copysign&lt;/code&gt; have been added to the floating point primitive types &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, you can use these to copy the sign of one number onto another. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    assert_eq!(3.5_f32.copysign(-0.42), -3.5);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Check whether a &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt; a value&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust 1.35.0 contains a few freshly minted methods on the &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these, you can easily check whether a given value exists in a range. For example, you may write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    if (0..=10).contains(&amp;amp;5) {
        println!(&quot;Five is included in zero to ten.&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Map and split a borrowed &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; value in two&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rust 1.35.0, you can now map and split the borrowed value of a &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; into multiple borrows for different components of the borrowed data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Replace the value of a &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; through a closure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release introduces a convenience method &lt;code&gt;replace_with&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it, you can more ergonomically map and replace the current value of the cell and get back the old value as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hash a pointer or reference by address, not value&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release, we have introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function takes a raw pointer and hashes it. Using &lt;code&gt;ptr::hash&lt;/code&gt;, you can avoid hashing the pointed-to value of a reference and instead hash the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copy the contents of an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning with Rust 1.0.0, the methods &lt;code&gt;Option::cloned&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; have allowed you to clone the contents in case of &lt;code&gt;Some(_)&lt;/code&gt;. However, cloning can sometimes be an expensive operation and the methods &lt;code&gt;opt.cloned()&lt;/code&gt; provided no hints to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release of Rust, we introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality of &lt;code&gt;opt.copied()&lt;/code&gt; is the same as for &lt;code&gt;opt.cloned()&lt;/code&gt;. However, calling the method requires that &lt;code&gt;T: Copy&lt;/code&gt;. Using this method, you can make sure that code stops compiling should &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; no longer implements &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changes in Clippy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release of Rust, Clippy (a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code) added a new lint &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#drop_bounds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_bounds&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This lint triggers when you add a bound &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; to a generic function. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo&amp;lt;T: Drop&amp;gt;(x: T) {}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a bound &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; is almost always a mistake as it excludes types, such as &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt;, which have trivial drop-glues. Moreover, &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; does not account for types like &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; not having interesting destructor behavior directly but rather as a result of embedding types, such as &lt;code&gt;Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#drop_bounds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_bounds&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this release of Clippy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/4101&quot;&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; the lint&lt;code&gt;redundant_closure&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;redundant_closure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redundant_closure_for_method_calls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-135-beta&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for Clippy&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changes in Cargo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-135-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for Cargo&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors to 1.35.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.35.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.35.0/&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Indicted Under Espionage Act, Raising First Amendment Issues</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indicted-espionage-act-first-amendment.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indicted-espionage-act-first-amendment.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, has been indicted on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010, the Justice Department announced on Thursday — a novel case that raises profound First Amendment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1037-julian-assange-espionage-act-indictment/426b4e534ab60553ba6c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new charges&lt;/a&gt; were part of an expanded indictment obtained by the Trump administration that significantly raised the stakes of the legal case against Mr. Assange, who is already fighting extradition proceedings in London based on &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/europe/julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador-embassy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;an earlier hacking-related count&lt;/a&gt; brought by federal prosecutors in Northern Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The charges are the latest twist in a career in which Mr. Assange has morphed from a crusader for radical transparency to fugitive from a Swedish sexual assault investigation, to tool of Russia’s election interference, to criminal defendant in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Assange vaulted to global fame nearly a decade ago as a champion of openness about what governments secretly do. But with this indictment, he has become the target for a case that could open the door to criminalizing activities that are crucial to American investigative journalists who write about national security matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The case has nothing to do with Russia’s election interference in 2016, when Mr. Assange’s organization published Democratic emails stolen by Russia as part of its covert efforts to help elect President Trump. Instead, it focuses on Mr. Assange’s role in the leak of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and military files by the former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Department officials did not explain why they decided to charge Mr. Assange under the Espionage Act — a step also debated within the Obama administration but ultimately not taken. Although the indictment could establish a precedent that deems actions related to obtaining, and in some cases publishing, state secrets to be criminal, the officials sought to minimize the implications for press freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/assange-indictment.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Press freedoms and the case against Julian Assange, explained.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They noted that most of the new charges were related to obtaining the secret document archives, as opposed to publishing them. In the counts that deemed the publication of the files a crime, prosecutors focused on a handful of documents revealing the names of people who provided information to the United States in dangerous places like war zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Some say that Assange is a journalist and that he should be immune from prosecution for these actions,” John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said at a briefing with reporters. “The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy and we thank you for it. It is not and has never been the department’s policy to target them for reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Assange, he said, was “no journalist.” Mr. Demers accused him of conspiring with Ms. Manning to obtain classified information. “No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposefully publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in a war zone, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the purposes of press freedoms, what matters is not who counts as a journalist, but whether journalistic activities — whether performed by a “journalist” or anyone else — can be crimes in America. The Trump administration’s move could establish a precedent used to criminalize future acts of national-security journalism, said Jameel Jaffer of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The charges rely almost entirely on conduct that investigative journalists engage in every day,” he said. “The indictment should be understood as a frontal attack on press freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Demers left the press briefing without taking questions. And a Justice Department official who stayed behind to answer questions on the condition that he would not be named would not address any about how most of the basic actions the indictment deemed felonies by Mr. Assange differed in a legally meaningful way from ordinary national-security investigative journalism — encouraging sources to provide secret information of news value, obtaining it without the government’s permission and then publishing portions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Notably, The New York Times, among many other news organizations, obtained precisely the same archives of documents from WikiLeaks, without authorization from the government — the act that most of the charges addressed. While The Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/26editors-note.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;did take steps to withhold the names of informants&lt;/a&gt; in the subset of the files it published, it is not clear how that is legally different from publishing other classified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Barry J. Pollack, a lawyer for Mr. Assange, said his client was being charged with a crime “for encouraging sources to provide him truthful information and for publishing that information.” That dramatic step, he said, removed the “fig leaf” that the case about his client was only about hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-bsn42l&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1t0v8sy etkm6pg0&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1a74oa6 etkm6pg1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1ihorw etkm6pg2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/23/business/23assangemedia/23assangemedia-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Video player loading&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Over the years, the WikiLeaks founder has been embraced by everyone from Lady Gaga to Sean Hannity. But he’s also made enemies along the way. Our video shows how his anti-secrecy agenda has attracted, and repelled, people across the political spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;emkp2hg2 css-1nwzsjy e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hannah McKay/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These unprecedented charges demonstrate the gravity of the threat the criminal prosecution of Julian Assange poses to all journalists in their endeavor to inform the public about actions that have been taken by the U.S. government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For most of American history, it was rare for the government to treat the leaking of its secrets to the news media as a crime. But starting in the second half of the George W. Bush administration and accelerating during the Obama administration, the Justice Department began making much more routine use of the Espionage Act to go after officials who provided information to the public through reporters, as opposed to actual spies. The World War I-era law criminalizes the disclosure of potentially damaging national security secrets to someone not authorized to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On its face, the Espionage Act could also be used to prosecute reporters who publish government secrets. But many legal scholars believe that prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information would violate the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That notion has never been tested in court, however, because until now the government has never brought such charges. The closest it came was indicting two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group in 2005 who received classified information about American policy toward Iran and passed it on. But that case fell apart after several skeptical pretrial rulings by a judge, and the charges were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though he is not a conventional journalist, much of what Mr. Assange does at WikiLeaks is difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful way from what traditional news organizations like The Times do: seek and publish information that officials want to be secret, including classified national security matters, and take steps to protect the confidentiality of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Obama administration had also weighed charging Mr. Assange, but rejected that step out of fears that it would chill investigative journalism and could be struck down as unconstitutional. A Justice Department official declined to address whether there was any new evidence that had come to light recently or whether the Trump administration had simply decided to take a step the Obama administration had shied away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The three charges that squarely addressed Mr. Assange’s publication of government secrets were focused on a handful of files that contained the names of people who had provided information to the United States in dangerous places like the Afghanistan and Iraq war zones, and authoritarian states like China, Iran and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The evidence laid out in the indictment against Mr. Assange mapped onto information presented by military prosecutors in the 2013 court-martial trial of Ms. Manning. Prosecutors in her case also alleged that her actions endangered the people whose names were revealed in the documents when Mr. Assange published them, though they presented no evidence that anyone was killed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A Justice Department official declined to say whether any such evidence now exists, but stressed that prosecutors would need to prove in court only what they say in the indictment: that publication put people in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison — by far the longest punishment for a leak case in American history. But in one of his last acts in office, President Barack Obama commuted most of the remainder of her sentence in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She is now back in jail again, after a judge held her in contempt for refusing to testify about her interactions with Mr. Assange before the grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia that indicted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Manning’s disclosure via WikiLeaks was one of the most extraordinary leaks in American history — the bulk disclosure of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables that revealed many secret things about the world, dossiers about Guantánamo Bay detainees being held without trial, and logs of significant events in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars that divulged, among other things, that civilian casualties were far higher than official estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Ms. Manning’s disclosures initially vaulted Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks to global fame, he was seen as a villain by the Obama administration and the permanent bureaucracy of law-enforcement and national-security officials, but treated as an icon by transparency and antiwar activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His image later transformed significantly when WikiLeaks published archives of Democratic emails that had been stolen and provided to him by the Russian government as part of its covert efforts to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election. But the legal case against Mr. Assange has nothing to do with those subsequent events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Assange was indicted in March 2018 in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on a charge of conspiring to commit unlawful computer intrusion. Prosecutors accused Mr. Assange of agreeing to help Ms. Manning crack an encoded portion of a passcode that would have enabled her to log on to a classified military network under a different user name than her own, which would have masked her tracks better. That came after she had already started sending files, and they have not alleged that his efforts succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That charge was unveiled in April, when Mr. Assange was arrested in London after being dragged out of the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had lived for years to avoid capture. The United States has asked Britain to extradite Mr. Assange, who is fighting the move, and the filing of the new charges clears the way for British courts to weigh whether it would be lawful to transfer custody of him to a place where he will face Espionage Act charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago exactly, someone began hacking Equifax. Today, it’s starting to feel some pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach was made possible by a software vulnerability that was already known and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/oh-man-youre-gonna-hate-what-equifax-just-admitted-abo-1809064565&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oh-man-youre-gonna-hate-what-equifax-just-admitted-abo-1809064565', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;fixable for months&lt;/a&gt;. The intrusion into Equifax’s network began in May 2017 but wasn’t discovered until July. The credit reporting company failed catastrophically to spot the data flowing out of its coffers. By the time anyone noticed, the information of about 150 million people was compromised, though it would take them several months to realize the full tally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress has called the entire incident “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;entirely preventable&lt;/a&gt;” and one congressman called Equifax executives “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberscoop.com/consumer-protection-subcommittee-rails-equifax-seeks-answers-retired-ceo/?category_news=news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cyberscoop.com/consumer-protection-subcommittee-rails-equifax-seeks-answers-retired-ceo/?category_news=news', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside of Capitol Hill, the conversation was a lot less polite. Two years on, no one knows who stole that mountain of sensitive data or what they’ve done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is taking notice of the consequences. This week, the financial rating service Moody’s downgraded Equifax from a “stable” to a “negative” outlook due to the high level of cybersecurity spending and litigation that comes as a direct result of the 2017 breach. It’s the first time cybersecurity was cited as the reason for an outlook change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/moodys-downgrades-equifax-outlook-to-negative-cites-cybersecurity.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/moodys-downgrades-equifax-outlook-to-negative-cites-cybersecurity.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers add up to a fortune, even for a massive corporation like Equifax. Lawsuits and investigations have cost $690 million in the first quarter of 2019 alone, which Moody’s cited as one of the reasons for its outlook downgrade. Moody’s expects $400 million more spent in each of the next two years and then a $250 million bill in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash Equifax will have to spend in relation to the cyberattack and bolstering its security are going to ding the company’s profits, according to Moodys, which explained in its report that, after next year, Equifax’s “infrastructure investments are likely to remain higher than they had been before the 2017 breach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the lawsuits will keep coming: In January, an Atlanta judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/equifax-breach-lawsuit/equifax-must-face-lawsuits-over-massive-data-breach-ruling-idUSL1N1ZT255&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/equifax-breach-lawsuit/equifax-must-face-lawsuits-over-massive-data-breach-ruling-idUSL1N1ZT255', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; Equifax’s attempts to dismiss class-actions filed against the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax may be the first to have its outlook dinged as a result of a data breach but it is likely not the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The heightened emphasis on cybersecurity for all data oriented companies, which is especially acute for Equifax, leads us to expect that higher cybersecurity costs will continue to hurt the company’s profit and free cash flow for the foreseeable future,” Moody’s report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are spending more on cybersecurity. Equifax, however, is playing catch up and paying a premium to do so—although anyone hoping for a solid legislative solution would say the cash price Equifax is now paying is not nearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive home the point about Equifax’s spectacular blunder, here are the highlights from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448?_ga=2.143995702.2092165228.1558295709-2100675449.1537904885&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448?_ga=2.143995702.2092165228.1558295709-2100675449.1537904885', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a 2018 congressional report&lt;/a&gt; on the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entirely preventable.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks. Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues, the data breach could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of accountability and management structure.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax failed to implement clear lines of authority within their internal IT management structure, leading to an execution gap between IT policy development and operation. Ultimately, the gap restricted the company’s ability to implement security initiatives in a comprehensive and timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex and outdated IT systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax’s aggressive growth strategy and accumulation of data resulted in a complex IT environment. Both the complexity and antiquated nature of Equifax’s custom-built legacy systems made IT security especially challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to implement responsible security measurements.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax allowed over 300 security certificates to expire, including 79 certificates for monitoring business critical domains. Failure to renew an expired digital certificate for 19 months left Equifax without visibility on the exfiltration of data during the time of the cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprepared to support affected consumers.&lt;/strong&gt; After Equifax informed the public of the data breach, they were unprepared to identify, alert and support affected consumers. The breach website and call centers were immediately overwhelmed, resulting in affected consumers being unable to access information necessary to protect their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry on top is the very nature of Equifax’s business. There is an entire industry on which Equifax sits near the top that tracks every bit of personal data they can find about you. Credit reporting companies know about your bank accounts, credit card, date of birth, Social Security number, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people make an informed decision to hand all that data over to companies like Equifax which explains the surprise of many Americans when they found out their data was likely involved in that 2017 breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are an American adult, the smart bet is that your data was stolen, too.&lt;/p&gt;
