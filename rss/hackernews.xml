&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;13b5&quot; id=&quot;13b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;What I gained, lost &amp;amp; learned while working for Microsoft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cba9&quot; id=&quot;cba9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Many people ask — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;how does a person get into Microsoft? How is the interview? What is it like?&lt;/em&gt; For me it was everything for 3,5 years. Now, 18 months later, I feel ready to share my story and say a real goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34b0&quot; id=&quot;34b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was interning at a marketing agency at the time after prior experience in a startup and was browsing job offers. Still in college at 23 and full of ideas and hopes for the future, I applied, just like that, for a MACH program — Microsoft Academy for College Hires. Recruitment process was long, had several stages and ended with an assessment center. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Fun fact: I was asked a ‘tricky’ question about why are the sewer covers round.&lt;/em&gt; And another, not that fun, but more important fact &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I got a position in the Developer Experience and Evangelism&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Department&lt;/strong&gt; (now CSE? or something else, it evolves all the time…) as an Audience Marketing Manager located in Warsaw, Poland. My role was to get people, especially in small IT companies, to try out Microsoft Azure (responsible for the breadth market). It was 5 years ago, cloud services were a novelty and the press wasn’t that great. I got serious e-mails from entrepreneurs where Microsoft was spelled ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;M$&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;475c&quot; id=&quot;475c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of the first things I noticed is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;almost everyone working for Microsoft had this &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;perfect life&lt;/em&gt; — a spouse, kids, nice houses, good cars&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted that too. Imagining that if I were to stay at this company, my life would become like theirs. (It was one of the illusions I had fallen for immediately, but I’ll get to the shattering reality later…) At that time, I was in a decent relationship myself and decided to take the most out of this chance focusing on my personal growth as well as the professional opportunities Microsoft provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1560&quot; id=&quot;1560&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And it has provided a ton. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I got my first responsibilities and targets on the day 1&lt;/strong&gt;, but I also received a lot of support and training. As a newly hired employee I was participating in MGX (now it’s Inspire?) in Atlanta, had trainings in Amsterdam, Madrid. There were so many interesting people there who I met and self-assured and mean ones as well. It’s a whole spectrum. I was on calls with people from all around the world on a daily basis and I got paid well. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A dream job&lt;/em&gt;. My team at the time was consisting of i.a. 4 guys, more less my age, with whom I got along very well, so I started spending crazy hours at the office. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;As a person working for DX, I was encouraged to go to conferences, workshops, hackathons, meetups whenever I wanted to and so I did&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a time where I was barely at home. I was excited. I was meeting new, inspiring people and learning so much every day! Meanwhile the First Class travels, taxis, nice hotels and fancy restaurants were spoiling me. This and everyone’s admiration, that I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

The conference I co-organized, with Satya Nadella as a keynote speaker
&lt;p name=&quot;d287&quot; id=&quot;d287&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;On the other hand, it wasn’t all so glamorous. Many of the employees didn’t respect me, to them I was a “starlet”, this “stupid, young girl with a diastema” (yep, someone at the office called me that), some were mad that they hired a 23 year old girl instead of a “professional man”. But I was ok with that, I knew I had to prove myself first. What I wasn’t ok with, were the comments about my looks. A few guys working both for Microsoft and Partners were treating me like a cute puppy or telling me they wanted to have sex with me while drunk, but all of it seemed minor and acceptable — I was gettng so much in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c433&quot; id=&quot;c433&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Back home, my partner didn’t share my enthusiasm. He was under the belief we were to start building a home together, but I was barely there. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Twenty something and living my life to maximum, or what I believed was a maximum at that time — working non stop and drinking way too much&lt;/strong&gt;. I remember writing e-mails at 2 a.m. in a club! Even now it doesn’t seem that crazy to me. My lack of self care wasn’t only the alcohol — I gained 10kg (22lb) during the first year. It’s a common thing to gain weight once you’re hired. We laughed about it, it was a standard. Everyone went through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a22&quot; id=&quot;8a22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Time was passing. People were either changing teams or getting fired. It was painful, I actually cried this one time while saying goodbye to one of my team members who was fired without any real explanation. He wasn’t a Full Time Employee, so he got no compensation (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for those who don’t know — you can be hired in MS either as an FTE, employed by Microsoft — with all the benefits, trips, trainings etc. or as a vendor — through a hiring agency and no privileges that FTEs have&lt;/em&gt;), but no one else seemed to care. I invested so much in this work by this point. I fought fights no one else wanted to pick up. I tried changing things, but I was constantly paying the price — with my health and with my relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;26b9&quot; id=&quot;26b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I went to Burning Man and moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend. Got into an affair at the office, which turned out to be a usual thing. People have gotten into affairs all the time. I heard of a rule: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;if it’s 100 km/80 miles from home, it doesn’t count&lt;/em&gt;. Guys were saying that as a joke, but then were actually caught on cheating. The whole illusion of these &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;‘perfect’ lives&lt;/em&gt; disappeared. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Many were like me, working non stop not finding time for their close ones, although they were able to find partners who seemed ok with that.&lt;/strong&gt; I think this was a moment when I stopped believing in how awesome working at Microsoft was, even though everyone around still seemed so excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d24&quot; id=&quot;8d24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The atmosphere wasn’t there anymore, things were changing, they were no longer that fun, but I got more interesting responsibilities - meeting and working with the technical community leaders. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I graduated the 2 year MACH program and was rewarded as the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Best Employee&lt;/em&gt; of the department.&lt;/strong&gt; I received a nice bonus and an offer to go to Redmond for a couple of months, for an employee exchange. I also had a 1:1 meeting with the Department Director, who told me that I can’t be a rebel anymore and kind of threatened me that I should be more careful, because Microsoft has provided me a “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;golden cage”&lt;/em&gt; and if I ever get out, I will have to face a tough reality. Yep, that was the message: you were young and feisty, and that’s cool, but now chill and never think about leaving, because the world outside will eat you alive, ok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f27e&quot; id=&quot;f27e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Meanwhile my relationship ended, I was miserable, but somehow my career seemed to flourish.&lt;/strong&gt; I got this great opportunity to work in Redmond and have a chance to find myself a position there, so I can be one of the ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;corp&lt;/em&gt;’ employees! How amazing! That’s something most of the people in the field dream of, right?&lt;/p&gt;

The view from my apartment in Belltown, Seattle
&lt;p name=&quot;708d&quot; id=&quot;708d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I chose a corporate housing apartment in downtown Seattle, got a beautiful place (which was probably the best apartment I will ever live in in my life). Last floor of a fancy building and a balcony with an ocean view. Gorgeous. And then I started work. Huge campus, nice cafeterias, woods, a pond, overwhelming space. Everything seemed great, but… yes, unfortunately there was a but… but &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the people&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The people I had on my team, were extremely closed minded. Most of them with many years of experience working in a corporation, so even more closed minded, only caring about their manager’s approval&lt;/strong&gt;. I was devastated. They were the most fake people I have met still to this day. I cannot even explain how terrible it was for me to have to help them, show interest and pretend that I support what they’re doing. You might be thinking — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;why weren’t you honest with them instead?&lt;/em&gt; I tried. On 1:1 peer conversations, with my manager, with my skip manager, but no one cared and my role was minimised, so at the end I was only doing a 1 Excel file. I am 100% certain that if I played by their rules and acted the way that they did, focusing on politics, I would do great there, but I refused to do that. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I actually cared about my role, I cared about the people we were doing the Connect event for more than for my career and no one seemed to understand that.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe I slowly started to become depressed during this time. I stopped showing up at the office and was basically counting down the days to come back home. I have spent 3 months there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;092e&quot; id=&quot;092e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I got back, I was really happy for a first couple of days, but then that feeling started to fade fast. I didn’t want to come to the office in Warsaw either. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I was staying home more and more everyday, often not even getting up from bed, just browsing e-mails and checking in on Skype to pretend that I’m working&lt;/strong&gt;. I wish I could say it was a day or two, but it was weeks. I thought about quitting all the time since I came back from Redmond, but I still enjoyed working with the community leaders and it was a part of my job that kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;

CEE MVP Summit, Belgrade, Serbia, march 2017
&lt;p name=&quot;c5af&quot; id=&quot;c5af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There were structural changes on a global level at Microsoft. I told my manager I don’t want any bonus that year, since I was in Redmond, didn’t have that much impact locally and he should reward other people. I didn’t deserve a bonus either, I couldn’t stand my job anymore, but still didn’t have the guts to quit. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;It was ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;a dream job&lt;/em&gt;’, it has given me so much, it took so much from me&lt;/strong&gt;, but I needed a break. In a midst of the changes I asked for a 3 month unpaid leave. Others warned me that it was a bad idea and that it’s not the time, but I just couldn’t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32f5&quot; id=&quot;32f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I ended up receiving 5 weeks off and went to Portugal for a Workaway. It changed me as well as changed the way I perceived life. It gave me the fresh perspective of a minimalistic lifestyle and not needing all the Microsoft benefits and paychecks to be happy. During my vacation I got some signals that I might get fired. My job title at that time was a Technical Evangelist and it was a hoax. I wasn’t great technically, but the official blueprint stated that the team needed more TEs and I had learned to code, so it was given to me. One of the many ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;little white lies&lt;/em&gt;’… Corporate was trying to minimize these local level hoaxes and I respect that, but it meant that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I came back to Warsaw to receive the dismissal papers&lt;/strong&gt;. There was more going on with a new role proposal etc., but I had the best role (for me) there was in Poland and going back to Redmond seemed like the worst nightmare. I signed the papers and cried for more than an hour. From being the best employee one year, to being fired the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c72&quot; id=&quot;8c72&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The saddest part is, it wasn’t my manager who told me this. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;My manager, who I worked with 3,5 years by then, didn’t even talk to me during this whole process at all&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the friends I believed I had, all these people I have spent so much time with, immediately became strangers. I didn’t have a goodbye meeting, wasn’t invited to parties anymore. I had been dedicating myself to a job while sacrificing my relationships, myself and only 2 people from Microsoft cared (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;1 of them because we were dating at that time&lt;/em&gt;). The kind words I have heard were from the people outside — the community leaders, who were appreciative and supportive for which I am forever grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1de3&quot; id=&quot;1de3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t a ‘&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;golden cage&lt;/em&gt;’ I was in, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;it was a bubble of illusions that popped once I signed my dismissal papers. Illusions of importance, mission, friendships and luxury&lt;/strong&gt;. I found a job fairly easily with a similar salary, where they didn’t expect me to work 24/7. The only thing that really changed for ‘the worse’ is that I’m not Ubering that much and don’t spend money on fancy hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5db8&quot; id=&quot;5db8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity Microsoft has given me. For all the trainings, all the experience, all the travels. I wouldn’t be the person I am today if it wasn’t for this organization, but I am even more grateful for being fired. I didn’t have it in me to quit myself and now I am much better + got the compensation money. I’m 28, have learned to put myself first and spent plenty of time on self care, enough to be able to share this publicly and hopefully not to make the same mistakes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d13&quot; id=&quot;4d13&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So... Goodbye Microsoft! It was a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b068&quot; id=&quot;b068&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;P.S. I know there are teams at Microsoft that are different (shout out to VS Code engineering team!), but I just wasn’t lucky enough to work at one ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b69&quot; id=&quot;3b69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;P.S. 2 Thanks so much for reading my story, I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boeing altered key switches in 737 MAX cockpit limiting ability to shut off MCAS</title>
<link>https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the middle of Boeing 737 cockpits, sitting between the pilot seats, are two toggle switches that can immediately shut off power to the systems that control the angle of the plane’s horizontal tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those switches are critical in the event a malfunction causes movements that the pilots don’t want. And Boeing sees the toggles as a vital backstop to a new safety system on the 737 MAX – the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) – which is suspected of repeatedly moving the horizontal tails on the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights that crashed and killed a total of 346 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Boeing was transitioning from its 737 NG model to the 737 MAX, the company altered the labeling and the purpose of those two switches. The functionality of the switches became more restrictive on the MAX than on previous models, closing out an option that could conceivably have helped the pilots in the Ethiopian Airlines flight regain control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing declined to detail the specific functionality of the two switches. But after obtaining and reviewing flight manual documents, The Seattle Times found that the left switch on the 737 NG model is capable of deactivating the buttons on the yoke that pilots regularly press with their thumb to control the horizontal stabilizer. The right switch on the 737 NG was labeled “AUTO PILOT” and is capable of deactivating just the automated controls of the stabilizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the newer 737 MAX, according to documents reviewed by The Times, those two switches were changed to perform the same function – flipping either one of them would turn off all electric controls of the stabilizer. That means there is no longer an option to turn off automated functions – such as MCAS – without also turning off the thumb buttons the pilots would normally use to control the stabilizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Lemme, a former Boeing flight-controls engineer who has been closely scrutinizing the MAX design and first raised questions about the switches &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.satcom.guru/2019/04/stabilizer-trim-loads-and-range.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;content-link external&quot;&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt;, said he doesn’t understand why Boeing abandoned the old setup. He said if the company had maintained the switch design from the 737 NG, Boeing could have instructed pilots after the Lion Air crash last year to simply flip the “AUTO PILOT” switch to deactivate MCAS and continue flying with the normal trim buttons on the control wheel. He said that would have saved the Ethiopian Airlines plane and the 157 people on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt in my mind that they would have been fine,” Lemme said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing said in a statement that the company had historically called for pilots to flip both switches to shut of a problematic or “runaway” stabilizer, so the change on the MAX ensured that the function of the switches matched that procedure. The company said the two switches “were retained for commonality of the crew interface.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boeing strongly disagrees with any speculation or suggestion that pilots should deviate from these long-established and trained safety procedures,” Boeing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Lion Air flight in October, pilots were apparently unaware of MCAS. As various warnings went off in the cockpit, they never reached the conclusion to use the runaway stabilizer procedure. In the end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/black-box-data-reveals-lion-air-pilots-struggle-against-boeings-737-max-flight-control-system/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;data from the flight shows&lt;/a&gt;, the repeated commands of MCAS eventually sent the plane plummeting into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that crash, Boeing issued a directive calling for pilots to use the typical runaway stabilizer procedure to deal with MCAS in the event of a problem. Then pilots would be able to swivel the tail down manually by physically turning a control wheel that connects to the tail via cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, the pilots appear to have recognized the errant MCAS problem and flipped the cutoff switches as described in the checklist. But then it appears that the pilots were unable to move the manual wheel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeings-emergency-procedure-for-737-max-may-have-failed-on-ethiopian-flight/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;likely because the forces on the tail made it physically challenging to turn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom of Boeing’s runaway stabilizer checklist seems to acknowledge the possibility of this physically challenging scenario. It suggests that the pilots can first use the electric trim to neutralize those potential forces before hitting the cutout switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After failing to manually control the stabilizer, the Ethiopian Airlines pilots appear to have flipped the cutoff switches back on, which awakened the MCAS system. It soon sent the plane diving to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Talk to us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to seek information on the design, training and certification of the Boeing 737 MAX. If you have insights, please get in touch with aerospace reporter Dominic Gates at 206-464-2963 or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dgates@seattletimes.com&quot;&gt;dgates@seattletimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemme said he’s surprised that Boeing made the change to take away the functionality that could have allowed the pilots to shut off MCAS without shutting off the electric switches at their thumbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get it at all,” Lemme said. “I don’t see what the benefit was for making that change. It was like change for change’s sake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Doug Moss, an aviation consultant who has worked as a commercial pilot on Boeing planes, said the cutout switches need to be as simple as possible. Asking the pilots to flip one of the switches – instead of what they have historically known about flipping two switches simultaneously – may have just added a layer of complexity that isn’t helpful in an intense scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re pulling on the column with 80-100 pounds of force trying to save your life, your troubleshooting techniques are very weak,” Moss said. “You need some gut-level instinctive things to do to solve the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A veteran Boeing 737 test pilot said that all Boeing planes have two such cutoff switches, not just the 737. And both he and American Airlines Captain Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association who flies 737s, said they could think of no existing procedure that called for flipping only one of the switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure appears to be designed to prepare for a situation in which the plane’s stabilizer motor is for some reason jammed and moving uncommanded in one direction – a classic “runaway stabilizer” situation. That would require shutting off all power to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the FAA worked to inform pilots about the changes on the MAX airplane when it first came into service, the agency didn’t describe the new functionality of the switches. In its documentation, it simply noted a labeling change: “Stab Trim cutout switches panel nomenclature,” the Flight Standardization Board included on its list of differences between the plane models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mrw-header pt-27&quot;&gt;Most Read Business Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing did not answer questions Friday about the original purpose of the two-switch design on the 737 model – a plane that first entered service in the 1960s – or about whether the company plans any upcoming changes on the cutout switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 737 MAX grounded around the world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/faa-could-clear-boeing-max-to-fly-again-by-late-may-or-early-june/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;Boeing is now working on a fix to its MCAS system&lt;/a&gt;. The software update is expected to limit the power of MCAS and will consider multiple inputs so that it won’t take action in response to a single faulty sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Calculus with Julia</title>
<link>https://calculuswithjulia.github.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://calculuswithjulia.github.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a set of notes for learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus&quot;&gt;calculus&lt;/a&gt;. Since the mid 90s there has been a push to teach calculus using many different points of view. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.harvard.edu/~knill/pedagogy/harvardcalculus/&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; style rule of four says that as much as possible the conversation should include a graphical, numerical, algebraic, and verbal component. These notes use the programming language &lt;a href=&quot;http://julialang.org&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the graphical, numerical, and, at times, the algebraic aspects of calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of integrating a computer algebra system (such as &lt;code&gt;Mathematica&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Maple&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Sage&lt;/code&gt;) into the calculus conversation. Computer algebra systems can be magical. The popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/&quot;&gt;WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt; website calls the full power of &lt;code&gt;Mathematica&lt;/code&gt; while allowing an informal syntax that is flexible enough to be used as a backend for Apple's Siri feature. (&quot;Siri what is the graph of x squared minus 4?&quot;) For learning purposes, computer algebra systems model very well the algebraic/symbolic treatment of the material while providing means to illustrate the numeric aspects. Theses notes are a bit different in that &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; is primarily used for the numeric style of computing and the algebraic/symbolic treatment is added on. Doing the symbolic treatment by hand can be very beneficial while learning, and computer algebra systems make those exercises seem kind of pointless, as the finished product can be produced much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our real goal is to get at the concepts using technology as much as possible without getting bogged down in the mechanics of the computer language. We feel &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; has a very natural syntax that makes the initial start up not so much more difficult than using a calculator. The notes restrict themselves to a reduced set of computational concepts. This set is sufficient for working the problems in mathematics, but do not cover thoroughly many aspects of programming. (Those who are interested can go off on their own and &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; provides a rich opportunity to do so.) Within this restricted set, are operators that make many of the computations of calculus reduce to a function call of the form &lt;code&gt;action(function, arguments...)&lt;/code&gt;. With a small collection of actions that can be composed, many of the problems associated with introductory calculus can be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes are presented in pages covering a fairly focused concept, in a spirit similar to a section of a book. Just like a book, there are try-it-yourself questions at the end of each page. All have self-graded answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with Julia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before beginning, we need to get started with Julia. This is akin to going out and buying a calculator, though it won't take as long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precalculus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the necessary computational skills needed for employing &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; successfully to assist in learning calculus are in direct analogy to concepts of mathematics that are first introduced in precalculus or prior. This precalculus &lt;em&gt;review&lt;/em&gt;, covers some of the basic materials mathematically (though not systematically). More importantly it illustrates the key computational mechanics we will use throughout. A quick rundown of the &lt;code&gt;julia&lt;/code&gt; concepts alone is &lt;a href=&quot;https://calculuswithjulia.github.io/precalc/julia_overview.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Number systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking for granted a familiarity with basic calculators, we show in these two sections how &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; implements the functionality of a calculator in a manner not so different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculators really only use one type of number – floating point numbers. Floating point numbers are a model for the real numbers. However, there are many different sets of numbers in mathematics. Common ones include the integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. As well, we discuss logical values and vectors of numbers. Though integers are rational numbers, rational numbers are real numbers, and real numbers may be viewed as complex numbers, mathematically, these distinctions serve a purpose. &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; also makes these distinctions and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vectors as a mathematical object could be postponed for later, but they are introduced here as the &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; implementation makes an excellent choice for a container of one or more values. We also see how to work with more than one value at a time, a useful facility in future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form $a, a+h, a+2h, \dots, a+kh$. For example $3, 10, 17, 24, .., 52$. They prove very useful in describing collections of numbers. We introduce the range operator that models these within &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; and comprehensions that allow one to easily modify the simple sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of functions within calculus is widespread. This section shows how the basic usage within &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; follows very closely to common mathematical usage. It also shows that the abstract concept of a function is quite valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graphing calculator makes it very easy to produce a graph. &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;Plots&lt;/code&gt; package, makes it even easier and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Polynomials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polynomials play an important role in calculus. They give a family of functions for which the basic operations are well understood. In addition, they can be seen to provide approximations to functions. This section discusses polynomials and introduces the add-on package &lt;code&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt; for manipulating expressions in &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; symbolically. (This package uses the SymPy library from Python.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of a univariate polynomial are the values of $x$ for which $p(x)=0$. Roots are related to its factors. In calculus, the zeros of a derived function are used to infer properties of a function. This section shows some tools in &lt;code&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt; to find factors and roots, when they are available, and introduces the &lt;code&gt;Roots&lt;/code&gt; package for estimating roots numerically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rational expression is the ratio of two polynomial expressions. This section covers some additional details that arise when graphing such expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exponential and logarithmic functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Trigonometric functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigonometric functions are used to describe triangles, circles and oscillatory behaviors. This section provide a brief review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limits and Continuity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of a limit is at the heart of the two main operations of calculus, differentiation and integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous functions are at the center of any discussion of calculus concepts. These sections define them and illustrate a few implications for continuous functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Derivatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a function is a derived function that for each $x$ yields the slope of the &lt;em&gt;tangent line&lt;/em&gt; of the graph of $f$ at $(x,f(x))$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a function has certain features. These next sections explore one of the first uses of the derivative – using its zeros to characterize the original function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tangent line to the graph of a function at a point has slope given through the derivative. That the tangent line is the best linear approximation to the curve yields some insight to the curve through knowledge of just the tangent lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative finds use outside of the traditional way of specifying a function or relationship. These two sections look at some different cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generalization of the tangent line as the &quot;best&quot; approximation to a function by a line leads to the concept of the Taylor polynomial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integral is initially defined in terms of an associated area and then generalized. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows this area to be computed easily through a related function and specifies the relationship between the integral and the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration is not algorithmic, but rather problems can involve an array of techniques. Many of these are implemented in &lt;code&gt;SymPy&lt;/code&gt;. Theses sections introduce the main techniques that find widespread usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various applications of the integral are presented. The first two sections continue with the idea that an integral is related to area. From there, it is seen that volumes and arc-lengths may be expressed in terms of related integrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary differential equations are an application of integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-dimensional curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to curves generated by graphs of functions, there are other ways to describe curves in two dimensions. One involves parameterizing both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates by a third variable, such as time. The other, polar curves, describes position in terms of a angle from the positive $x$ axis and a radial distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Why CRDT didn&amp;#039;t work out as well for collaborative editing xi-editor</title>
<link>https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This reply is going to be scoped to the CRDT only. I have been meaning to write a larger retrospective of xi-editor; consider this the CRDT portion of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took on investigation of OT/CRDT with the hope that there was a &quot;right answer&quot; to collaborative editing, only needing to be discovered, and that one approach could unify a number of asynchrony-related issues, including IME being in a different process (actually the earliest motivation, as Android has serious asynchrony correctness problems around this), syntax highlighting being potentially slower than typing, and the effect where annotations from Language Server style modules being applied to incorrect regions in the face of concurrent editing, not to mention collaborative editing itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hoped that a collaborative editing engine might be implemented, possibly with a tricky implementation, but so that the complexity could be encapsulated, and clients of this engine wouldn't have to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I believe these were reasonable assumptions, but I believe turned out to be wrong. I'll go into them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There is a &quot;right answer&quot; to collaborative editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I was especially hopeful that CRDT would turn out to be that &quot;right answer,&quot; because it is on a sound mathematical footing (monotonic semi-lattices). Those mathematical structures might sound exotic to many, but are comforting and familiar to me (I had read and loved Dijkstra's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461279242&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics&lt;/a&gt; when it came out, so it would have been especially rewarding to see a new application of lattices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the literature of CRDT does specify a &lt;em&gt;mathematically&lt;/em&gt; correct answer (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/publications/podc2016-collabedit.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Specification and Complexity of Collaborative Text Editing&lt;/a&gt; for a careful exposition of the specification as well as a result that it requires some form of tombstone to implement correctly). But this does not always line up with what humans would find the most faithful rendering of intent. Take for example, a document initially &quot;A B C&quot;, with one user deciding to change &quot;B&quot; to &quot;D&quot;, and the other user deciding that sentence needs rewriting, with &quot;E F G&quot; as the result. Clearly either &quot;A D C&quot; or &quot;E F G&quot; is a reasonable result, but a CRDT essentially demands that the result be either &quot;DE F G&quot; or &quot;E F GD&quot;, the tie resolved through timestamps or some similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different use cases for asynchronous editing have different intent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.645793801392&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual collaborative editing, you probably want to preserve the inserts, the CRDT is not unreasonable, at least you can likely get to a good state just by deleting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9632352941176&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IME is a complex beast in and of itself (as &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;user&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/hovercards?user_id=1976330&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/lord&quot;&gt;@lord&lt;/a&gt; can attest from our work on this in Fuchsia). Suffice it to say that there is an impedance mismatch between platform IME protocols and a CRDT, and the fact that xi still has a somewhat hacky approach to IME makes my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For syntax highlighting, any form of OT or CRDT is overkill; the highlighting is a stateless function of the document, so if there's a conflict, you can just toss the highlighting state and start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.8372093023256&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For annotations from Language Server, you might not want to toss &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; annotations in the face of concurrent editing (as this might add to latency between a result being available and presented to the user), but a simple approach can work well, no need to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkbottomup.com.au/site/blog/Google_Wave_Intention_Preservation_Branching_Merging_and_TP2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TP2 puzzle&lt;/a&gt;. In cases that get really hairy, it is fine to discard and re-analyze, as it's unlikely that a heavily OT'ed result will be perfectly accurate in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.72&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the trickiest cases is insertion of whitespace and bracket balancing. The problem here is that, unlike the previous two cases, it's stateful. The plugin edits are direct responses to user-initiated edits. Another complicating factor is that these are not just string edits, the cursor position is affected (it's common for some whitespace to be inserted before the cursor, and say a newline after). This motivated the entire &quot;priority&quot; system, which I tried to explain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_10.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rope science part 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion now is that these different cases are actually different, and a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach does a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Encapsulating complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful software project management is mostly about taming complexity. A happy case is when you can define a module that might be complex internally, but that complexity is hidden from the rest of the system. An extreme example of this is a SAT solver - these are complex beasts, on which many academic careers have been made, but you can write a brute force one in an afternoon. Within text editing, an example I'd hold up is xi-rope. There's a lot of cool functionality (you can iterate by Unicode grapheme cluster!), excellent performance characteristics (especially worst-case, which is where ropes shine), but isn't significantly harder to use for editing tasks than strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, contrary to my hopes, CRDT's do not have this property. By now we have lots of examples where trying to design features around the structure imposed by CRDT turned out to be a lot more complicated than it would be in a more synchronous world - we saw the auto-indent stuff above, difficulty getting the selection right in transpose (which required us to invent a new &quot;drift&quot; mechanic), interactions between &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/458&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;issue&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/458/hovercard&quot;&gt;selection and undo&lt;/a&gt;, and, my personal most regretted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/pull/230&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;pull_request&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/xi-editor/xi-editor/pull/230/hovercard&quot;&gt;soft spans&lt;/a&gt;, where we had a promising prototype, but it ultimately was abandoned because of impedance mismatch with the CRDT model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these cases, I believe the complexity exported by the CRDT is responsible, and we'd have solutions in hand if it weren't for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual collaborative editing is a lot harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, xi had difficulty making up its mind whether it was actually a collaborative editor or not. Tristan's intern project got us to a tech demo of collaborative editing on Fuchsia (it was very heartening to see!), but we always knew that building a real collaborative editor was a major increase in scope. At the back of my mind, I hoped that a solid CRDT engine would evolve into something that would relatively easily support collaborative editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this was a pretty bad case of YAGNI. It would have been better to either commit to doing collaborative editing, and marshal the resources to make that happen, or to have it out of scope and reduce the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CRDT is a tradeoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still believe you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; build a collaborative editor on the basis of the original xi-editor roadmap, CRDT and all, and that would have some very desirable properties. This promise is one reason it's taken me so long to get to my current thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the mathematical foundation, the main thing CRDT buys you is the ability to propagate edits through a mesh-like network, exploiting local connections, as opposed to requiring a central server. I think that's appealing &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you're actually editing in such an environment. For large scale organizations (I'm familiar with those and have had great conversations more recently with &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;user&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/hovercards?user_id=14013&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dsp&quot;&gt;@dsp&lt;/a&gt;), I think it does make sense to treat the set of analysis and review tools as a form of collaborative editing, but those are also cases where a centralized server is completely viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I've heard an interesting theory about why CRDT-type solutions are relatively popular in the cloud. To do OT well, you need to elect a centralized server, which is responsible for all edits to a document. I believe the word for this is &quot;server affinity,&quot; and Google implements it very well. They need to, for Jupiter-style OT (Google Docs) to work. But when you're getting cloud resources from platforms like AWS, server affinity is much more difficult to attain, so in those cases you favor an eventually-consistent, federated network, where any server can accept any edit in any order, and it'll all work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flip side of the tradeoff is that you have to express your application logic in CRDT-compatible form. How do you represent the merge rules for soft spans as a monotonic semi-lattice? I bet it's possible (I actually love those kinds of puzzles), but it's probably a Masters level research topic, while doing it synchronously is something any of us could do. If we had a hard requirement to do collaborative editing over a mesh network, and resources to make that happen, I bet we could solve that and all the other problems. Indeed, this is pretty much what I hoped to be doing a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I come to the conclusion that the CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. When I think about a future evolution of xi-editor, I see a much brighter future with a simpler, largely synchronous model, that still of course has enough revision tracking to get good results with asynchronous peers like the language server. The &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; editing commands, including indentation and paren matching, are more simply done as synchronous operations, and I think avoiding that complexity is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this view into my thinking is useful. I might expand this into a blog post or at least link to it when I do get around to writing a retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and yet simple course in Machine Learning using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/machinelearningmindset/machine-learning-course#id5&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/code&gt;, as a tool for &lt;code&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;, is one of the most widely adopted scientific fields. A considerable amount of literature has been published on Machine Learning. The purpose of this project is to provide the most important aspects of &lt;code&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/code&gt; by presenting a series of simple and yet comprehensive tutorials using &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;. In this project, we built our tutorials using many different well-known Machine Learning frameworks such as &lt;code&gt;Scikit-learn&lt;/code&gt;. In this project you will learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the definition of Machine Learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it started and what is the trending evolution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the Machine Learning categories and sucategories?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the mostly used Machine Learning algorithms and how to implement them?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6ed0&quot; id=&quot;6ed0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This week a new paper was published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognition&lt;/a&gt; titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Critical Period for Second Language Acquisition&lt;/a&gt;” that used a new, viral Facebook-quiz-powered method of gathering a huge linguistic dataset to provide new insights into how human beings learn language and what effect age has on that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b0e5&quot; id=&quot;b0e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In a nutshell, this team found that if you start learning a language before the age of 18, you have a much better likelihood of obtaining a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;native-like&lt;/em&gt; mastery of the language’s grammar than if you start later. This is a much older age than has been generally assumed and is really interesting for reasons I’ll get into a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8933&quot; id=&quot;8933&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This data has also given us a really amazing insight into language learning in general and shows that adults of any age can obtain incredible mastery nearly as quickly as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e71d&quot; id=&quot;e71d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, a number of journalists have &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/5261446/language-critical-period-age/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://time.com/5261446/language-critical-period-age/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misinterpreted&lt;/a&gt; this paper badly, resulting in a lot of articles falsely stating things as embarrassing and misleading as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2018/may/02/fluent-another-language-adult-impossible-try&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2018/may/02/fluent-another-language-adult-impossible-try&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Becoming fluent in another language as an adult might be impossible&lt;/a&gt;”, when in fact the opposite is shown. If you see an article saying that you need to start learning a language before you’re 10 to become fluent, be assured that it’s simply lazy reporting. The truth is much more interesting and encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14ec&quot; id=&quot;14ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We know this, because in an incredible move, the researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/pyb8s/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://osf.io/pyb8s/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released the entire dataset&lt;/a&gt; they based this paper off of, letting us take a look. Let’s go through some interesting things that this amazing data shows us about learning languages and why it should motivate you to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6aff&quot; id=&quot;6aff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many late learners become native-like&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3cf0&quot; id=&quot;3cf0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Looking through the data, it’s quite clear that there is a statistical advantage to starting your learning earlier. If you compare the average score of learners who started at different ages, there is a clear advantage to having started earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*pJ7VIUsx1rvXHfQ6s4NsSA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2530&quot; data-height=&quot;1144&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*pJ7VIUsx1rvXHfQ6s4NsSA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pJ7VIUsx1rvXHfQ6s4NsSA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;94cd&quot; id=&quot;94cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;However, looking more closely at the data for the students who started learning after the age of 20, there are &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of late learners who outperformed many native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7380&quot; id=&quot;7380&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, we need to specify what “native-like” performance on this quiz is. Looking at the quiz results of the group of users who are tagged as native English speakers, we have a range of scores from 100% (which 12% of native speakers scored) down to scoring 90% for the bottom 5% of native speakers. To me, this indicates that scoring anything above a 90% on the test means you’re performing at least as well as many native speakers would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a08&quot; id=&quot;0a08&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many articles have breathlessly stated that it’s just impossible to achieve native-like mastery if you start after the age of 10 (or 18, depending on the article), but is that true? Certainly &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt; the later learner seems to have a rarer time getting there, but is it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e72&quot; id=&quot;0e72&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The data tells us that it’s not. On average less likely, certainly, but there are &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people who took this quiz, got a score in the range that a native speaker would, and started learning the language after the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;c1aa&quot; id=&quot;c1aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;Thousands of adults who started learning after 20 years old scored in a native-level range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0468&quot; id=&quot;0468&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Instead of looking at the median of this late-learning group, let’s just look at the top quartile of the speakers who started learning after the age of 20. We can graph that adjusted by how many years since they started studying the language.&lt;/p&gt;

The top quartile of results of learners who started after the age of 20, by number of years of exposure, showing that at around 8–10 years of exposure, many learners who started well into adulthood do just as well as many native speakers. All results above the 0.9 line are in the native results range.
&lt;p name=&quot;9d69&quot; id=&quot;9d69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here we can see that many of the later learners score easily within the range that native speakers do (above the 0.9 line). In fact, if we graph the results of the top quartile of after-20 learners with the median scores of the other groups (those who started learning before 5, before 10 and before 20 years old), it doesn’t look much different.&lt;/p&gt;

Comparing the performance of the top quartile of over-20 learners with students who started learning before 5 (red), before 10 (yellow) and before 20 (green)
&lt;p name=&quot;d77d&quot; id=&quot;d77d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Given the same amount of time, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the top quarter of learners from the over-20 group&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;do just as well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;as the average of those who started before 10&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;203d&quot; id=&quot;203d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(After about 20 years of learning exposure, the over-20 group line gets pretty wobbly, since we have less and less data to work with — starting at 20 and having 20 years of exposure makes the youngest group there at least 40 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;8fae&quot; id=&quot;8fae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Comparing apples to apples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7ddc&quot; id=&quot;7ddc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;But why would we do this? Shouldn’t we compare the medians of all of the groups, like the very first graph? Shouldn’t we compare apples to apples — it’s not really fair to compare the median of one group with the best of another, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a38&quot; id=&quot;4a38&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Well, the problem is that there is no way to compare apples to apples with this dataset, and the authors point this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;232b&quot; id=&quot;232b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is because the “drop” in learning advantage happens at 17 or 18 years old according to this paper, but why is that? What happens at 18 years old? Is it that there is some incredible and magical brain-change that happens? Or is it that people’s lives fundamentally change on average — you go to college, you enter the workforce, you move out of your parents house, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;5cc1&quot; id=&quot;5cc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For instance, it remains possible that the critical period is an epiphenomenon of culture: the age we identified (17–18 years old) coincides with a number of social changes, any of which could diminish one’s ability, opportunity, or willingness to learn a new language. In many cultures, this age marks the transition to the workforce or to professional education, which may diminish opportunities to learn.” — from A Critical Period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af06&quot; id=&quot;af06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;If you start “studying” a language at the age of 5, you’re not sitting down with a book and explicitly learning the language for an hour a day. You’re almost certainly in a classroom environment where that language is spoken, possibly for several hours per day. If you start learning a language after you’re 20 years old, you almost certainly cannot be in a classroom for several hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0a61&quot; id=&quot;0a61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This brings up a big problem with the interpretation of this data. It gives us a lot of information, but it doesn’t give us the most important thing, which is the total amount of exposure that these students have had. I would argue that on average, your exposure per day to a language if you start after the age of 20 is going to be way lower than if you start when you’re 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe8f&quot; id=&quot;fe8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re in an English speaking school for 5 hours a day as a kid and your parent is studying the same language for an hour a day while you’re there and the kid learns 5 times faster than the parent, is it fair to then conclude that kids learn better than adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7302&quot; id=&quot;7302&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s highly possible that this learning difference by age is not due to some magic change in brain plasticity, but simply that adults don’t have as much time to be exposed as children and often hit a point where it stops being helpful to improve after a while. They become totally fluent at this slower pace and reaching native-level mastery provides little additional advantage. Maybe it’s not that it’s harder for older learners or that they’re not capable, maybe it’s just that they don’t have the same opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6a4&quot; id=&quot;e6a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Comparing the top quartile of the post-20 group is a simple guess to isolate a cohort of language learners who may have had more opportunity for exposure. I would guess that the post-20 learners would have much less uniform types of opportunities than children, whose experiences are probably much more similar in nature. It’s certainly not perfect, but it does indicate that there is a cohort in the post-20 crowd that does very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ee51&quot; id=&quot;ee51&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This quiz is incredibly hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;499f&quot; id=&quot;499f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There are a couple of other interesting things to note here. The first is how hard this quiz is. Even for the learners who started studying the language as a young child, it takes at least 7–8 years of exposure before any of the groups are consistently scoring above a 90% on this test.&lt;/p&gt;

Which image is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--figure-strong&quot;&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; correct for this sentence?
&lt;p name=&quot;f014&quot; id=&quot;f014&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This test is not about fluency, it’s about highly pedantic grammatical accuracy. If you got through this entire test at all, you’re probably pretty close to basic fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;979c&quot; id=&quot;979c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re thinking that this paper provides some reason why you’re not fluently speaking French after your 3 months of using some language-game app, you are wrong. Children won’t learn a language masterfully that way either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;e6fd&quot; id=&quot;e6fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Studies that compare children and adults exposed to comparable material in the lab or during the initial months of an immersion program show that adults perform better, not worse, than children (Huang, 2015; Krashen, Long, &amp;amp; Scarcella, 1979; Snow &amp;amp; Hoefnagel-Höhle, 1978), perhaps because they deploy conscious strategies and transfer what they know about their first language.” — from A Critical Period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;517d&quot; id=&quot;517d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Adults are actually better in many ways at learning a language&lt;/strong&gt; up to a point of general fluency, but getting to where you can answer the most subtle of grammatical points with the accuracy of a native speaker takes a decade no matter how old you are when you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cb3f&quot; id=&quot;cb3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That so many adults who started learning a language after 20 years old (or even later) did so well on this test should be encouraging. If you want to put in the effort, it’s entirely possible to perform at a native level on an incredibly difficult test like this — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people did just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ea75&quot; id=&quot;ea75&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It doesn’t matter what language you come from&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;46c8&quot; id=&quot;46c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This paper also gives us some really interesting insights from a broad range of backgrounds. They had nearly 3/4 million people take the quiz and got demographic data from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*HwAS9AxIQGb7Whtjh_qIBg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1278&quot; data-height=&quot;1320&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*HwAS9AxIQGb7Whtjh_qIBg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HwAS9AxIQGb7Whtjh_qIBg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a4f&quot; id=&quot;7a4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The first thing to notice is how little data they actually were able to get from people who started after the age of 20. It’s a tiny fraction of their dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe19&quot; id=&quot;fe19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The other thing is how many different languages learners came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e1c&quot; id=&quot;2e1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s common to say “this language is hard to learn” or “that language is so easy”, but this data showed that these things may not be true. They found that there was little difference in the learning speeds or ultimate attainment of English coming from any linguistic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;24fe&quot; id=&quot;24fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In fact, the differences across language groups were small (see Fig. S14) and generally not reliable.” — from A Critical Period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Fyo7I4yQGk1PevS2N5mwNQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1478&quot; data-height=&quot;716&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Fyo7I4yQGk1PevS2N5mwNQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Fyo7I4yQGk1PevS2N5mwNQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;a1d8&quot; id=&quot;a1d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Studying a language for a year can make you quite fluent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f5c8&quot; id=&quot;f5c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Finally, the thing I would like everyone to take away from this is how good adults can be at language learning. It may be harder for us to get to where we could pass for a native, but that’s probably pretty obvious and not why most of us start learning a language, right? You’re not trying to be a spy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*U7gEN-fPZo0NFeMcHq8P3w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1184&quot; data-height=&quot;818&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*U7gEN-fPZo0NFeMcHq8P3w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*U7gEN-fPZo0NFeMcHq8P3w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Close-up of our previous graph, focusing on the results of the first few years of exposure.
&lt;p name=&quot;cfbb&quot; id=&quot;cfbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Take a look at my previous graph of the various language groups. You can see that even after a year of studying, the 20+ year old start group is commonly scoring 80-85% on this incredibly difficult grammar test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0fb3&quot; id=&quot;0fb3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sure, it takes another 10 years to get to where you might pass for a native on this test, but look at what you can do in a single year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e24&quot; id=&quot;6e24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t use poorly reported studies like this convince you not to try learning a language. The truth is that you’re almost certainly very good at it. People consistently learn new languages in a year or two from no knowledge to very capable, fluent levels and in my personal experience, much faster than children given the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d9ab&quot; id=&quot;d9ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That last mile, getting from fluent to native-like, is statistically more difficult, as this paper shows, but like any good 80/20 rule, the first 80% of the results takes 20% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;a2fa&quot; id=&quot;a2fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is remarkable about language is that we are (nearly) all extremely good at it, including adult learners.” — from A Critical Period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf01&quot; id=&quot;cf01&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing&quot;&gt;You can become fluent in a language in a few years of work, I see it all the time. This paper further proves that even starting much later in life, it’s still possible (if not as common) to reach incredibly high levels of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: I replaced Google Analytics with simple log-based analytics</title>
<link>https://benhoyt.com/writings/replacing-google-analytics/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://benhoyt.com/writings/replacing-google-analytics/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;April 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is a good tool: it’s free, easy to implement, and has served me well over the years. However, partly because I’m not in love with Big Brother Google looking over the shoulder of all my website visitors, and partly because I like experiments in minimalism, I decided to replace Google Analytics on &lt;a href=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/&quot;&gt;benhoyt.com&lt;/a&gt; with a simple analytics setup based on log file parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log file parsing is an old-skool but effective way of measuring the traffic to your site. It works with or without JavaScript (my version uses a hybrid approach), and doesn’t send any data to Google or other tracking companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I used three main tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon Cloudfront serving a transparent 1x1 pixel image (with logs going to S3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python script to convert the pixel logs to Apache/nginx “combined log format”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goaccess.io/&quot;&gt;GoAccess&lt;/a&gt; to actually parse the logs and show an analytics report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article describes why I used this approach and how I implemented it using GoAccess and a tiny bit of custom code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudfront-pixel&quot;&gt;Cloudfront pixel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My website is a simple and fast static site hosted via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; (it’s probably handling a Hacker News traffic spike as you read this ;-). To use GoAccess, I needed a simple way to write to a log file whenever someone requests a page. I decided to use a ping to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pixel.png&lt;/code&gt; file hosted on S3 and served via Cloudfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created a new S3 bucket and uploaded a single transparent 1x1 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pixel.png&lt;/code&gt; file. Then I created a Cloudfront distribution with logging enabled and pointed it at the S3 bucket (logs go to another S3 bucket).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I added a small code snippet at the bottom of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benhoyt/benhoyt.github.com/blob/master/_layouts/default.html&quot;&gt;page template&lt;/a&gt; (Cloudfront domain replaced to avoid bots hitting it from here):&lt;/p&gt;

                         &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cloudfront.example.net/pixel.png?
            u={{ page.url | url_encode }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If JavaScript is enabled, we create an image and point its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; to the Cloudfront pixel file, with the URL and referrer encoded in the query string (my log converter will later decode the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; parameters and output a log line in combined log format).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If JavaScript is disabled, we only have the page URL (no referrer), but at least we can still log the request. Most tracking systems, including Google Analytics, don’t work at all without JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-pixel-versus-direct-logging&quot;&gt;Why a pixel versus direct logging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it would have been simpler to put Cloudfront in front of GitHub Pages and point my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;benhoyt.com&lt;/code&gt; domain directly to Cloudfront. But I wanted to avoid having to modify DNS and fiddle with the SSL certificate in Cloudfront to prove out the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does mean I had to write a log conversion script (to decode the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; parameters in the query string). I may switch to the direct-to-Cloudfront approach later, but in the meantime the pixel-based approach works well, and is easier to change. Plus, writing a few dozen lines of Python is good therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-log-converter&quot;&gt;The log converter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benhoyt/benhoyt.github.com/blob/master/_scripts/cloudfront_to_combined.py&quot;&gt;converter script&lt;/a&gt; work? It reads Cloudfront log input files, decompresses them, decodes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; parameters in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pixel.png&lt;/code&gt; query string, and writes the output in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Combined_Log_Format&quot;&gt;combined log format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s nice about Python is its standard library. There’s a lesser-known package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which helps you read a bunch of input files line-at-a-time. Quoting from the help, typical use is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This iterates over the lines of all files listed on the command line (or stdin if there are no args). Exactly what you want for a text processing program. It also handles &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gz&lt;/code&gt; files (like Cloudfront log files) seamlessly with a simple tweak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;finput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;openhook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileinput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hook_compressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the script has read a Cloudfront log line and ensured it’s a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pixel.png&lt;/code&gt; request, it decodes the query string and outputs in combined log format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Decode &quot;u&quot; (URL) and &quot;r&quot; (referrer) in query string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'u'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;referrer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'-'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;referrer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;referrer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user_agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user_agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output is a single log file with all the log lines in it. My site is fairly low traffic, so this should be fine for the foreseeable. At some point I’ll write a script to go into S3 and delete old logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goaccess-report&quot;&gt;GoAccess report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goaccess.io/&quot;&gt;GoAccess&lt;/a&gt; is a great little tool that does the actual parsing and presentation of the data. It can be used in the terminal mode, but I prefer to output an HTML report. Here’s a screenshot of the output (showing hits/visitors per day, and hits per URL):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/images/goaccess-main.png&quot; alt=&quot;GoAccess HTML report - main&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like my articles about &lt;a href=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/writings/pygit/&quot;&gt;pygit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/writings/scandir/&quot;&gt;scandir&lt;/a&gt; are pretty popular (even though I wrote them a couple of years ago). There’s a bunch more detail, including an operating system breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/images/goaccess-os.png&quot; alt=&quot;GoAccess HTML report - operating systems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And referring domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benhoyt.com/images/goaccess-domains.png&quot; alt=&quot;GoAccess HTML report - domains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously with log parsing you don’t get as much information as a JavaScript-heavy, Google Analytics-style system. There’s no screen sizes, no time-on-page metrics, etc. But that’s okay for me! I’m free of the Google, and I had a bit of fun building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reuse or hack my code:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pilotwings demos act differently depending on when the cartridge was made</title>
<link>https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1126996260026605568</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;So you get yourself a ROM dumper, you plug in a copy of pilot wings that has the plane crashing, and you save it out to pw_crash.bin
then you do the same to the other cartridge, the nice-landing one, giving you pw_land.bin

Pop them in your file-comparer: THEY'RE THE SAME.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GitHub Package Registry</title>
<link>https://github.blog/2019-05-10-introducing-github-package-registry/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.blog/2019-05-10-introducing-github-package-registry/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we’re excited to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/package-registry&quot;&gt;GitHub Package Registry&lt;/a&gt;, a package management service that makes it easy to publish public or private packages next to your source code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;GitHub Package Registry is fully integrated with GitHub, so you can use the same search, browsing, and management tools to find and publish packages as you do for your repositories. You can also use the same user and team permissions to manage code and packages together. GitHub Package Registry provides fast, reliable downloads backed by GitHub’s global CDN. And it supports familiar package management tools: JavaScript (npm), Java (Maven), Ruby (RubyGems), .NET (NuGet), and Docker images, with more to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can try GitHub Package Registry today in limited beta. It will always be free to use for open source—more pricing details will be announced soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/package-registry/signup&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sign up for the beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packages, together, with your code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you work on a project that has dependencies on packages, it’s important for you to trust them, understand their code, and connect with the community who built them. And inside organizations, you need to be able to quickly find what’s been approved for your use. GitHub Package Registry makes it easy to use the same familiar GitHub interface to find public packages anywhere on GitHub, or private packages within your organization or repositories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If your repository is more complex, you’ll be able to publish multiple packages of different types. And, with webhooks or with GitHub Actions, you can fully customize your publishing and post-publishing workflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Publishing an open source package? Most open source projects have their code on GitHub, so you can publish prerelease versions of your packages for testing within your community, and then easily promote specific versions to the public registry of your choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified identity and permissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now you can use a single set of credentials across both, and manage access permissions with the same tools. Packages on GitHub inherit the visibility and permissions associated with the repository, and organizations no longer need to maintain a separate package registry and mirror permissions across systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Package insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This makes it easy to find and use the right package as a dependency for your project, and increase your confidence that it only contains what’s advertised. With more insights into the packages you publish, you can understand exactly how other people and repositories are using them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
