<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-key-findings&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary &amp;amp; Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;In July and August 2020, government operatives used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/companies/nso-group/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NSO&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Pegasus spyware to hack 36 personal phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;. The personal phone of a journalist at London-based &lt;em&gt;Al Araby TV&lt;/em&gt; was also hacked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;The phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KISMET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which appears to involve an invisible zero-click exploit in iMessage. In July 2020, KISMET was a zero-day against at least iOS 13.5.1 and could hack Apple’s then-latest iPhone 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;Based on logs from compromised phones, we believe that NSO Group customers also successfully deployed KISMET or a related zero-click, zero-day exploit between October and December 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;The journalists were hacked by four Pegasus operators, including one operator &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that we attribute to Saudi Arabia, and one operator &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that we attribute to the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;We do not believe that KISMET works against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections. All iOS device owners should immediately update to the latest version of the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;Given the global reach of NSO Group’s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;Infrastructure used in these attacks included servers in Germany, France, UK, and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma, and DigitalOcean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;mt2&quot;&gt;We have shared our findings with Apple and they have confirmed to us they are looking into the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware is a mobile phone surveillance solution that enables customers to remotely exploit and monitor devices. The company is a prolific seller of surveillance technology to governments around the world, and its products have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;regularly linked to surveillance abuses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pegasus became known for the telltale malicious links sent to targets via SMS for many years. This method was used by NSO Group customers to target &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ahmed Mansoor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of members of civil society in &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mexico&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and political dissidents targeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The use of malicious links in SMSes made it possible for investigators and targets to quickly identify evidence of past targeting. Targets could not only &lt;em&gt;notice&lt;/em&gt; these suspicious messages, but they could also &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; their message history to detect evidence of hacking attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, NSO Group is shifting towards zero-click exploits and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;network-based attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that allow its government clients to break into phones &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;without any interaction from the target&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and without leaving any visible traces. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2019 WhatsApp breach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where at least 1,400 phones were targeted via an exploit sent through a missed voice call, is one example of such a shift. Fortunately, in this case, WhatsApp notified targets. However, it is more challenging for researchers to track these zero-click attacks because targets may not notice anything suspicious on their phone. Even if they do observe something like “weird” call behavior, the event may be transient and not leave any traces on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift towards zero-click attacks by an industry and customers already steeped in secrecy increases the likelihood of abuse going undetected. Nevertheless, we continue to develop new technical means to track surveillance abuses, such as new techniques of network and device analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imessage-emerges-as-a-zero-click-vector&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iMessage Emerges as a Zero-Click Vector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Since at least 2016, spyware vendors appear to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/12/14/the-pernicious-invisibility-of-zero-click-mobile-attacks/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;successfully deployed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; zero-click exploits against iPhone targets at a global scale. Several of these attempts have been reported to be through Apple’s iMessage app, which is installed by default on every iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Threat actors may have been aided in their iMessage attacks by the fact that certain components of iMessage have historically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ios-security-imessage-safari/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not been sandboxed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the same way as other apps on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that United Arab Emirates (UAE) cybersecurity company DarkMatter, operating on behalf of the UAE Government, purchased a zero-click iMessage exploit in 2016 that they referred to as “Karma,” which worked during several periods in 2016 and 2017. The UAE reportedly used Karma to break into the phones of hundreds of targets, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-media/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;chairmen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Al Araby TV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvakb3/inside-nso-group-spyware-demo&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vice Motherboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a Pegasus product presentation mentioned that NSO Group demonstrated a zero-click method for breaking into an iPhone. While the specific vulnerable app in that case was not reported, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-israel-s-cyber-spy-industry-aids-dictators-hunt-dissidents-and-gays-1.6573027&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2019&lt;/u&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Haaretz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interviewed “Yaniv,” a pseudonym used by a vulnerability researcher working in Israel’s offensive cyber industry, who seemed to indicate that spyware was sometimes deployed to iPhones via Apple’s Push Notification Service (APNs), the protocol upon which iMessage is based:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An espionage program can impersonate an application you’ve downloaded to your phone that sends push notifications via Apple’s servers. If the impersonating program sends a push notification and Apple doesn’t know that a weakness was exploited and that it’s not the app, it transmits the espionage program to the device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gulf-cooperation-council-a-booming-spyware-market&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gulf Cooperation Council: A Booming Spyware Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is one of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://wired.me/technology/privacy/surveillance-gulf-states/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;significant customer&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;bases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the commercial surveillance industry, with governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-with-israel-s-encouragement-nso-sold-spyware-to-uae-and-other-gulf-states-1.9093465&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reportedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paying hefty premiums to companies that provide them special services, including analysis of intelligence that they capture with the spyware. The UAE apparently became an NSO Group customer in 2013, in what was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5444998,00.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;described&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the “next big deal” for NSO Group after its first customer, Mexico. In 2017, Saudi Arabia (which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Citizen Lab calls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KINGDOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and Bahrain (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEARL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) appear to have also become customers of NSO Group. &lt;em&gt;Haaretz&lt;/em&gt; has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-with-israel-s-encouragement-nso-sold-spyware-to-uae-and-other-gulf-states-1.9093465&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Oman is an NSO Group customer, and that the Israeli Government prohibits NSO Group from doing business with Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;al-jazeera-and-the-middle-east-crisis&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; and the Middle East Crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;The relationship between Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt (jointly, “the four countries”) and Qatar is fractious. The four countries often claim that Qatar shelters dissidents from the four countries and supports political Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, whom they view as the most serious challenge to the existing political order in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/middleeast/3-persian-gulf-states-pull-ambassadors-from-qatar.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrew their ambassadors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and froze relations with Qatar for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-summit-ambassadors-idUSKCN0J00Y420141116&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A second crisis occurred on June 5, 2017, when the four countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40164552&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;cut off diplomatic relations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and closed their borders with Qatar. The crisis was ostensibly precipitated by a fake story planted on the state-run &lt;em&gt;Qatar News Agency&lt;/em&gt; (QNA) by hackers, which misquoted Qatar’s Emir referring to Iran as “an Islamic power,” and praising Hamas. According to US intelligence officials speaking with &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post,&lt;/em&gt; senior UAE Government officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/uae-hacked-qatari-government-sites-sparking-regional-upheaval-according-to-us-intelligence-officials/2017/07/16/00c46e54-698f-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;approved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the QNA hacking operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 23, 2017, the four countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/close-al-jazeera-saudi-arabia-issues-qatar-with-13-demands-to-end-blockade&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a joint statement which outlined 13 demands to Qatar, including closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, scaling down ties with Iran, and shutting down &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeer&lt;/em&gt;a and its affiliate stations and news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;al-jazeera-targeted-by-criticism-hacking-blocking-by-neighboring-countries&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;: targeted by criticism, hacking &amp;amp; blocking by neighboring countries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat distinctive in the Middle East in terms of its media coverage. On many issues, it presents alternative viewpoints not available from largely state-run media outlets in the region. Several other attempts at building credible media channels in the GCC have been met with less success, including Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal’s highly publicized Bahrain-based &lt;em&gt;Al Arab&lt;/em&gt; channel, which was permanently shut down by local authorities on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/02/saudi-prince-alarab-news-channel&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;first day of operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after airing an interview with a member of Bahrain’s opposition Al Wefaq political society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting featured prominently in the Arab Spring, where its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/middleeast/28jazeera.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extensive, real-time coverage of protests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya “helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next.” Leaders of countries neighboring Qatar regularly express deep concerns about its coverage and in some cases have taken action to limit the availability of the channel in their countries. In 2017, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/24/media/al-jazeera-blocked-saudi-arabia-uae/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;blocked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera’s&lt;/em&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Egypt’s President Mubarak in the Arab Spring, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi was elected President of Egypt. This election was considered by Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a threat and a sign of the expansion of Qatar’s regional influence because of Qatar’s history of support for the Muslim Brotherhood. However, Morsi was deposed by a military coup on July 3, 2013 led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and taken to military custody. One day after the coup, the military shut down a number of news stations in Egypt, including &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;’s bureau in Egypt, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/7/4/egypts-military-shuts-down-news-channels&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;detained five of the staff&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;’s Arabic language coverage of uprisings in neighboring Gulf countries, including Bahrain, was generally seen as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/al-jazeera-tv-network-draws-criticism-praise-for-coverage-of-arab-revolutions/2011/05/08/AFoHWs2G_story.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;striking a more muted tone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than its English language coverage, the channel was still criticized. For example, Bahrain’s Foreign Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/khalidalkhalifa/status/99281312271183872&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;famously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tweeted the following about a documentary on the channel: “It’s clear that in Qatar there are those who don’t want anything good for Bahrain. And this film on &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; English is the best example of this inexplicable hostility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section describes the hacking of two reporters’ phones, Tamer Almisshal and Rania Dridi. They are among the 36 reporters and editors targeted in the attack, most of whom have requested anonymity. Almisshal and Dridi consented to be named in this report and for the Citizen Lab to describe their targeting in detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Tamer Almisshal is a well-known investigative journalist for &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;’s Arabic language channel, where he anchors the “&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;ما خفي أعظم&lt;/span&gt;” program (translated as &lt;em&gt;“this is only the tip of the iceberg”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“what is hidden is more immense”&lt;/em&gt;). Almisshal’s program has reported on a wide variety of politically sensitive topics in the Middle East, including UAE, Saudi, and Bahraini Government involvement in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyP_b435TQ&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attempted 1996 coup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Qatar, the Bahrain Government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BptzscpcCBQ&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hiring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of a former Al-Qaeda operative for an assassination program, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQBxbSYeYAI&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi killing of Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and ties between a powerful member of the UAE’s Royal Family, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and UAE businessman B.R.

&lt;p&gt;While reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our Internet scanning as an &lt;em&gt;Installation Server&lt;/em&gt; for NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;We conclude that Almisshal’s phone reached out to the Pegasus Installation Server due to an apparent exploit delivered through Apple’s servers. In the 54 minutes before Almisshal’s phone visited the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed an unusual behavior: connections to a large number of &lt;em&gt;iCloud Partitions&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;p*-content.icloud.com&lt;/em&gt;). In the more than 3000 hours that we have been monitoring Almisshal’s Internet traffic, we have only seen 258 connections to iCloud Partitions (excluding &lt;em&gt;p20-content.icloud.com&lt;/em&gt;, which Almisshal’s phone uses for iCloud backups), with 228 of these connections (~88%) occurring during a 54 minute period between 10:32 and 11:28 on 19 July.&lt;a id=&quot;fnref1&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot; href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On 19 July, we saw no matching connections prior to 10:32 or after 11:28. The connections in question were to 18 iCloud partitions (all odd-numbered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Screenshot of a 19 July packet capture from Almisshal’s phone showing DNS lookups for iCloud Partitions immediately before a lookup for a Pegasus Installation Server.
&lt;p&gt;The connections to the iCloud Partitions on 19 July 2020 resulted in a net download of 2.06MB and a net upload of 1.25MB of data. Because these anomalous iCloud connections occurred—and ceased—immediately prior to Pegasus installation at 11:29 UTC, we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal’s phone was hacked. Our analysis of an infected device (&lt;strong&gt;Section 3&lt;/strong&gt;) indicates that the built-in iOS &lt;code&gt;imagent&lt;/code&gt; application was responsible for one of the spyware processes. The &lt;code&gt;imagent&lt;/code&gt; application is a background process that appears to be associated with iMessage and FaceTime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Sixteen seconds after the last connection to the Pegasus Installation Server, we observed Almisshal’s iPhone communicate for the first time with three additional IPs over the next 16 hours. We never observed his phone communicating with these IPs previously, and have not observed communications since.&lt;/p&gt;

The phone did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; set the SNI in the HTTPS Client Hello message, nor did it perform a DNS lookup for &lt;em&gt;bananakick.net&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps an effort to thwart our previously-reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS Cache Probing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technique to locate infected devices, or an effort to thwart anti-Pegasus countermeasures implemented nationwide in Turkey (&lt;strong&gt;Section 4&lt;/strong&gt;), another popular target of Pegasus operators. Because communications with these three servers commenced 16 seconds after the communications with a known Pegasus Installation Server, we suspected that these three IPs were Pegasus command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Almisshal’s device shows what appears to be an unusual number of kernel panics (phone crashes) between January and July 2020. While some of the panics may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reviewing device logs from Rania Dridi’s iPhone Xs Max, we found evidence that her phone was hacked at least six times with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware between 26 October 2019 and 23 July 2020. Two of these instances, on 26 October and 12 July, were likely zero-day exploits, as the phone appears to have been hacked while running the latest available version of iOS. At the other times Dridi’s phone was hacked, there was a newer version of iOS available, meaning that there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether the exploits were zero-days.&lt;/p&gt;

The 12 July 2020 attack, and another attack on 23 July 2020 appear to have used the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KISMET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; zero-click exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network logs show that Dridi’s phone communicated with the following four servers between 13 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 that we attributed to NSO Group operator &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; No communications were observed between 17 July and 22 July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suspect that the attacks on Dridi’s phone in October, November, and December 2019 also used a zero-click exploit, because we saw an NSO Group zero-click exploit deployed against another iPhone target during this timeframe, and because we found no evidence of telltale SMS or WhatsApp messages containing Pegasus spyware links on her phone. Network logs were unavailable for these periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Working with &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;’s IT team, we identified a total of 36 personal phones inside &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; that were hacked by four distinct clusters of servers which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators. An operator that we call &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; spied on. Two other operators, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, spied on 1 and 3 phones, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude with medium confidence that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; acts on behalf of the UAE Government, because this operator appears to target individuals primarily inside the UAE, and because one target hacked by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; previously received Pegasus links via SMS that point to the same domain name used in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.&lt;a id=&quot;fnref2&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot; href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/#fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We considered but view as less likely the hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; linked to the UAE. The UAE Government has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-raven-whitehouse/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;known to target&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Saudi activists, and both &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have been observed operating in concert in two cases: the case of &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;, and a case in Turkey, where the Turkish Computer Emergency Response Team apparently caught both operators at around the same time (&lt;strong&gt;Section 4&lt;/strong&gt;). However, we are aware of only one phone that was targeted by both operators, and we are not aware of any infrastructructure overlap between the two operators. Additionally, each operator seems to primarily target in a different country, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Saudi Arabia and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the UAE. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are reported to be Pegasus customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not able to determine the identity of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, though both appear to target mainly in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not observe infection attempts for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTER-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, so we are unsure which Pegasus Installation Servers were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure used in these attacks included servers located in Germany, France, UK, and Italy using cloud hosting providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma, and DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis-of-device-logs-from-a-live-pegasus-infection&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Analysis of Device Logs from a Live Pegasus Infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;We obtained logs from an iPhone 11 device inside &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; networks while it was infected. Our analysis indicates that the current Pegasus implant has a number of capabilities including: recording audio from the microphone including both ambient “hot mic” recording and audio of encrypted phone calls, and taking pictures. In addition, we believe the implant can track device location, and access passwords and stored credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tc pa2 bg-white&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ajcapabilities@4x.png&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-74742&quot; src=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ajcapabilities@4x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Some Pegasus implant capabilities observed on an infected device.&quot; width=&quot;2968&quot; height=&quot;2376&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Some Pegasus implant capabilities observed on an infected device.
&lt;p&gt;The phone logs showed a process &lt;code&gt;launchafd&lt;/code&gt; on the phone that was communicating with the four &lt;em&gt;*.crashparadox.net&lt;/em&gt; IP addresses in &lt;strong&gt;Table 1&lt;/strong&gt;, which we linked to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;launchafd&lt;/code&gt; process was located in flash memory in the &lt;code&gt;com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bg-washed-yellow ba b--gray pa2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchafd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This folder appears to be used for iOS updates, and we suspect that it may not survive iOS updates. It appeared that additional components of the spyware on this device were stored in a folder with a randomly generated name in &lt;code&gt;/private/var/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;. The contents of the &lt;code&gt;/private/var/tmp/&lt;/code&gt; folder do not persist when the device is rebooted. The parent process of &lt;code&gt;launchafd&lt;/code&gt; was listed as &lt;code&gt;rs&lt;/code&gt;, and was located in flash memory at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bg-washed-yellow ba b--gray pa2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;imagent&lt;/code&gt; process (part of a built-in Apple app handling iMessage and FaceTime) was listed as the responsible process for &lt;code&gt;rs&lt;/code&gt;, indicating possible exploitation involving iMessage or FaceTime. The same &lt;code&gt;rs&lt;/code&gt; process was also listed as parent of &lt;code&gt;passd&lt;/code&gt;, a built-in Apple app that interfaces with the keychain, as well as &lt;code&gt;natgd&lt;/code&gt;, another component of the spyware, which was located in flash memory at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bg-washed-yellow ba b--gray pa2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/natgd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three processes were running as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. We were unable to retrieve these binaries from flash memory, as we did not have access to a jailbreak for iPhone 11 running iOS 13.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone’s logs show evidence that the spyware was accessing a variety of frameworks on the phone, including the &lt;em&gt;Celestial.framework&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MediaExperience.framework&lt;/em&gt; which could be used to record audio data and camera, as well as the &lt;em&gt;LocationSupport.framework&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CoreLocation.framework&lt;/em&gt; to track the user’s location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;We have shared our findings and technical indicators with Apple Inc. which confirms that it is investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;In late 2019, Turkey’s Government-run Computer Emergency Response Team (USOM) appears to have observed Pegasus attacks involving both &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and sinkholed some domain names used by these operators on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USOM publishes a “list of malicious links” (“zararlı bağlantılar”) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usom.gov.tr/zararli-baglantilar/1.html&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;available on their website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The list of indicators includes domain names, URLs, as well as IP addresses. Turkish ISPs generally redirect their subscribers who try to access indicators on this list to a USOM sinkhole IP address (&lt;strong&gt;88.255.216.16&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tc pa2 bg-white&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-74702&quot; src=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Sandvine PacketLogic device on Turk Telekom’s network injects an HTTP redirect to USOM’s sinkhole in response to a request directed at a Pegasus C&amp;amp;C server.&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;74&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6:&lt;/strong&gt; A Sandvine PacketLogic device on Turk Telekom’s network injects an HTTP redirect to USOM’s sinkhole in response to a request directed at a Pegasus C&amp;amp;C server.
&lt;p&gt;Each ISP appears to implement this sinkholing using the same technique they use to implement website censorship. For example, Turk Telekom appears to use their &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/03/bad-traffic-sandvines-packetlogic-devices-deploy-government-spyware-turkey-syria/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sandvine PacketLogic devices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to inject HTTP redirects for elements on the USOM list, whereas Vodafone Turkey appears to use its DNS tampering system, returning the USOM IP in response to any request for a domain name on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tc pa2 bg-white&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image7.png&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-74703&quot; src=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Vodafone Turkey DNS server responds to our lookup for an unpublished MONARCHY Pegasus C&amp;amp;C domain name with USOM’s sinkhole IP address.&quot; width=&quot;1072&quot; height=&quot;234&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that USOM has a particular interest in Pegasus, as all Pegasus domain names published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;three&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2019/10/morocco-human-rights-defenders-targeted-with-nso-groups-spyware/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amnesty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about Pegasus were added to the USOM list after Amnesty’s publication.&lt;a id=&quot;fnref4&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot; href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/#fn4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;turkish-cert-sinkholes-pegasus-domains&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turkish CERT Sinkholes Pegasus Domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;On 5 November 2019, USOM added the following NSO Group Pegasus domain names and IP addresses to their list of malicious links. We attribute these domains and IPs to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. These indicators were not previously published in any other location that we can identify, and the USOM list indicates that the source of the domains and IPs was one of Turkey’s SOMEs (institutional computer emergency response teams (CERTs) for government agencies and industries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tc pa2 bg-white&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image1-1.png&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-74704&quot; src=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pegasus domain names and IP addresses on USOM’s list of malicious links.&quot; width=&quot;1830&quot; height=&quot;702&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8:&lt;/strong&gt; Pegasus domain names and IP addresses on USOM’s list of malicious links.
&lt;p&gt;We suspect that USOM’s information about the Pegasus infrastructure came from observing specific infections, as opposed to a broader compromise of NSO Group, or a broader effort to fingerprint NSO Group traffic within Turkey. Several other operators that appeared to be spying inside Turkey with Pegasus at the time did not have their infrastructure sinkholed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not aware which individuals were targeted in the attacks observed by the Turkish Government that triggered the sinkholing. However, a 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mentions that, in 2016 and 2017, the UAE used the “Karma” exploit to hack hundreds of individuals around the world, including the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;a id=&quot;fnref5&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot; href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/#fn5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the IP addresses added to the USOM list on 5 November 2019 appears to have been abandoned by NSO Group on 28 October 2019, suggesting that at least some of the attacks observed by Turkey occurred prior to 28 October. Interestingly, despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;regularhours.net&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;holdmydoor.com&lt;/em&gt; appeared on a Turkish CERT list in November 2019, we observed &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONARCHY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNEAKY KESTREL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; continue to use these domain names in attacks through August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion-the-spyware-industry-is-going-dark&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Discussion: The Spyware Industry is Going Dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;When authoritarian governments are enabled by commercial spyware companies like NSO Group, and emboldened by the belief that they are acting in secret, they target critical voices like journalists. Unfortunately, it is increasingly difficult to track such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spyware industry does business in secret, and major spyware sellers invest heavily in fighting regulation and avoiding legal accountability. Yet, certain industry realities and technical limitations have historically made it possible to track infections. For example, for many years all but the most sophisticated commercially available spyware required some user interaction, such as opening a document or clicking a link, to infect a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deception involved in tricking a target into becoming a victim left traces even after successful infections. These traces—especially messages used to seed spyware—have been an invaluable source of evidence for investigators. Over the years, by gathering and examining the ruses used to deliver spyware, often aided by victims themselves, it has been possible to identify hundreds of victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current trend towards zero-click infection vectors and more sophisticated anti-forensic capabilities is part of a broader industry-wide shift towards more sophisticated, less detectable means of surveillance. Although this is a predictable technological evolution, it increases the technological challenges facing both network administrators and investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is still possible to identify zero-click attacks—as we have done here—the technical effort required to identify cases markedly increases, as does the logistical complexity of investigations. As techniques grow more sophisticated, spyware developers are better able to obfuscate their activities, operate unimpeded in the global surveillance marketplace, and thus facilitate the continued abuse of human rights while evading public accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Counting the 36 cases revealed in this report, there are now at least fifty publicly known cases of journalists and others in media targeted with NSO spyware, with attacks observed as recently as August 2020. We have previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;identified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over a dozen journalists and civic media targeted with NSO Group’s spyware. Amnesty International has identified still more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/moroccan-journalist-targeted-with-network-injection-attacks-using-nso-groups-tools/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;targeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as recently as January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; attacks are part of an accelerating trend of espionage against journalists and news organizations. The Citizen Lab has documented digital attacks against journalists by threat actors from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/foreign-journalists-in-china-target-of-computer-attack/article1202851/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Russia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mexico&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UAE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Other research groups have documented similar trends, which appear to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/28/how-the-free-press-worldwide-is-under-threat&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;worsening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the COVID-19 pandemic. Often these attacks parallel more &lt;a href=&quot;https://cpj.org/reports/2019/09/10-most-censored-eritrea-north-korea-turkmenistan-journalist/&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more traditional&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forms of media control, and in some cases physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased targeting of the media is especially concerning given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1777882&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fragmented and often ad-hoc security practices and cultures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among journalists and media outlets, and the gap between the scale of threats and the security resources made available to reporters and newsrooms. These concerns are likely particularly acute for independent journalists in authoritarian states who, despite the fact that they play a crucial role in reporting information to the public, may be forced to work in dangerous conditions with even fewer security tools at their disposal than their peers in large news organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-but-new-perils&quot; class=&quot; lh-solid mb3&quot;&gt;Progress, But New Perils&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;Journalist security has attracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://cltc.berkeley.edu/journosec-guides&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1777882&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research interest,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; grantmaking, and practice innovation. Progress is showing in many areas. However, the zero-click techniques used against &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; staff were sophisticated, difficult to detect, and largely focused on the personal devices of reporters. Security awareness and policies are essential, but without substantial investment in security, network analysis, regular security audits and collaboration with researchers like the Citizen Lab these cases would not have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists and media outlets should not be forced to confront this situation on their own. Investments in journalist security and education must be accompanied by efforts to regulate the sale, transfer, and use of surveillance technology. As the anti-detection features of spyware become more sophisticated, the need for effective regulatory and oversight frameworks becomes increasingly urgent. The abuse of NSO Group’s zero-click iMessage attack to target journalists reinforces the need for a global moratorium on the sale and transfer of surveillance technology, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/SR2019ReportToHRC.aspx&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called for by the U.N. Special Rapporteur&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, &lt;em&gt;“until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices and guarantee that governments and non-State actors use the tools in legitimate ways&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These safeguards should include strengthening and expanding regional and international export controls, enacting national legislation that constrains invasive new surveillance technology such as zero-click spyware, and the expansion of mandatory due diligence requirements for spyware developers and brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mt0&quot;&gt;We have seen no evidence that the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KISMET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; exploit still functions on iOS 14 and above, although we are basing our observations on a finite sample of observed devices. Apple made many new security improvements with iOS 14 and we suspect that these changes blocked the exploit. Although we believe that NSO Group is constantly working to develop new vectors of infection, &lt;strong&gt;if you own an Apple iOS device you should immediately update to iOS 14.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204&quot; class=&quot;hover-black link underline hover-bg-lightest-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click here for instructions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s always been a bit of a balancing act to decide which games I write about in detail here — a matter of balancing my level of personal interest in each candidate against its historical importance. In the early years of this project especially, when I still saw it as focusing almost exclusively on narrative-oriented games, I passed over some worthy candidates because I considered them somewhat out of scope. And now, needless to say, I regret some of those omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the games that’s been made most conspicuous by its absence here is &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;, Doug Smith’s seminal action-puzzle platformer from 1983. “Iconic” is a painfully overused adjective today, but, if any game truly can be called an icon of its era, it’s this one. So, I decided to take the release of &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner: The Legend Returns&lt;/em&gt;, a 1994 remake/re-imagining that does fit neatly into our current position in the historical chronology, as an opportunity to have a belated look back at the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4507&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/douglas_e-_smith/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4507&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4507&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4507&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Douglas_E._Smith.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;252&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4507&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Doug Smith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 1981, Doug Smith was studying architecture and numerical analysis at the University of Washington in Seattle. Meanwhile he had a part-time job in one of the university’s computer labs, where he met two other students named James Bratsanos and Tracy Steinbeck, who were tinkering with a game they called &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt;, a not so-thinly-veiled reference to the arcade hit &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt;. Bratsanos had first created &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt; the previous year on one of his high school’s Commodore PET microcomputers, and the two were now in the process of porting it to one of the university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11&quot;&gt;DEC VAX-11/780&lt;/a&gt; minicomputers. Smith soon joined the effort. When their fellow students started to show some interest in what they were doing, they made the game publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt;, you guided a little man through a single-screen labyrinth of tunnels linked by ladders, implemented entirely using monochrome textual characters; your man was a dollar sign, your enemies paragraph symbols. Armed only with a pick axe that was more tool than weapon, you must steal all of the gold that was lying around the place, whilst avoiding or delaying the guards who protected it, generally by digging pits into which they could fall. The group hid their game from the university’s administrators by embedding it into an otherwise broken graphing program. “‘Graph’ would prompt the user for a function,” remembers a fellow student named Rick LaMont, “then crap out unless the secret password was entered to play &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its captive audience of playtesters in the form of the students who hung around the computer labs, the game grew organically as the weeks passed. Soon students were coming by &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to play &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt;; Lamont claims that “a ‘show process’ command would often report 80 percent of the users running ‘graph.'” Eager players began to queue up behind the university’s computer terminals, and &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt; became a fixture of campus life, the University of Washington’s equivalent of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/01/zork-on-the-pdp-10&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had once been at MIT. Along the way, it gradually evolved from an arcade game into something that required as much thought as reflexes; the levels just kept getting more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Smith, it was his eight-year-old nephew who convinced him to port the game to the Apple II; having visited the computer lab once or twice and seen it in action there, the little boy was decidedly eager for a version he could play at home. “After he bugged me enough,” said Smith in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/18/locknlode&quot;&gt;a 1999 interview&lt;/a&gt;, “one weekend I rewrote it for the Apple II, basically in three days.” This first microcomputer version was a copy of the DEC VAX version right down to its monochrome ASCII graphics. Smith made just one big change: he renamed the game &lt;em&gt;Miner&lt;/em&gt; to avoid legal entanglements. After paying James Bratsanos $1500 for the rights to the game, he submitted it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/08/broderbund&quot;&gt;Brøderbund Software&lt;/a&gt;, only to get a terse rejection letter back: “Thank you for submitting your game concept. Unfortunately, it does not fit with our product line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, seeing how popular the game continued to be at the university, Smith decided to take another stab at it. He borrowed enough money to buy a color monitor and joystick for his Apple II, and programmed a second, much-improved version with color bitmap graphics and controls that took advantage of one of the Apple’s unique affordances: its joysticks had two buttons rather than the standard one, which in this case allowed the player’s avatar to drill to the left or right of himself without the player ever having to reach for the keyboard. In late 1982, Smith sent this new version to four different publishers, among them Brøderbund and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta&quot;&gt;Sierra&lt;/a&gt;. All of them knew as soon as they saw this latest version of the game that they wanted it for themselves. John Williams, the little brother of Sierra founder Ken Williams, and the company’s chief financial officer from the tender age of twenty, later claimed that he “almost lost his job” because he spent so much time playing the game Smith sent to them. But Smith wouldn’t end up publishing his game through Sierra. Instead he wound up entrusting it to Brøderbund after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded and run as a family business by a personable former lawyer and real-estate developer named Doug Carlston, Brøderbund would consistently demonstrate an uncanny talent for identifying exactly the software product that Middle America was looking for at any given moment, securing it for themselves, and then delivering it to their customers in the most appealing possible way. (At the risk of sounding unkind, I might note at this juncture that, whereas Ken Williams loved to &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about the mainstreaming of games and other software, the Carlston family talked less but proved more adept at the practical work of doing so.) In the years to come, this talent would result in a quantity of truly iconic Brøderbund titles out of all proportion to the relatively modest number of products which the company released in total: titles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/karateka&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karateka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2014/08/apple-carmen-sandiego-and-the-rise-of-edutainment&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Street_Writer&quot;&gt;Bank Street Writer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Print_Shop&quot;&gt;The Print Shop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/10/how-jordan-mechner-made-a-different-sort-of-interactive-movie-or-the-virtues-of-restraint&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/06/simcity-part-1-will-wrights-city-in-a-box&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;SimCity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But before any of them came Doug Smith’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brøderbund offered Smith a $10,000 advance and a very generous 23-percent royalty. And they also promised to get behind his game with the kind of concerted, professional marketing push that was still a rarity in the industry of that era. Showing a remarkable degree of restraint for his age as well as faith in his game’s potential, Smith signed with Brøderbund rather than accept another publisher’s offer of $100,000 outright, with no royalty to follow. He would be amply rewarded for his foresight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it was Brøderbund’s savvy marketers who gave &lt;em&gt;Miner&lt;/em&gt; its final name. Well aware of the existence of another, superficially similar platform game called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/miner-2049er&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miner 2049er&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they proposed the alternate title of &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;, as in “running after the mother lode.” Soon after choosing this new name that held fast the idea that the player was some sort or other of miner, they devised a more detailed fictional context for the whole affair that abandoned that notion entirely. It involved the evil Bungeling Empire, the antagonist of their 1982 hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/08/choplifter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choplifter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a galactic commando deep in enemy territory. Power-hungry leaders of the repressive Bungeling Empire have stolen a fortune in gold from the people by means of excessive fast-food taxes. Your task? To infiltrate each of 150 different treasure rooms, evade the deadly Bungeling guards, and recover every chest of Bungeling booty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of this narrative, the hero’s pick axe became a laser drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, none of this background would be remembered by anyone who actually played the game. Instead the supposed Bungeling guards would become popularly known as “mad monks,” which their pudgy low-resolution shapes rather resembled. Doubtless plenty of imaginative young gamers made up new narratives of their own to fit the bizarre image of greedy monks chasing an intrepid adventurer up and down a maze of scaffolding dotted with gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4506&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; on the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith dropped out of university at the end of 1982, and worked closely with Brøderbund over the course of six months or so to polish his game in a concerted, methodical way, something that was seldom done at this early date. They helped him to tweak each of the 150 levels — some designed by Smith himself, some by the kids who lived around Smith’s family home, whom he paid out of his own pocket on a per-level basis — to a state of near-perfection, and arranged them all so that they steadily progressed in difficulty as you played through them one after another. And then Brøderbund encouraged Smith to polish up his level editor and include that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; got a rapturous reception upon its release in June of 1983, quickly becoming the best-selling product Brøderbund had ever released to that point; Smith was soon collecting more than $70,000 per month in royalties. If anything, its reputation among students of game design has become even more hallowed today. It stands out from its peers of 1983 like a young Glenn Gould in a beginner’s piano course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; is not quite the &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; game which its more enraptured devotees are sometimes tempted into claiming it to be. When James Bratsanos first created what would eventually become &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; on the Commodore PET, he was according to his own testimony working from a friend’s description of an arcade game: “He didn’t explain it well, and I took creative liberties and assumed I understood what he meant. So for certain elements I completely misinterpreted it.” Bratsanos, an acknowledged non-gamer, may later have come to believe that the game his friend had been describing was &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt;, and assumed that the major differences between that game and his stemmed from his youthful “misinterpretation” of his friend’s description of the former. But the chronology here doesn’t pass muster: &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; was first released in the summer of 1981, while Bratsanos is sure that he started working on his game, which originally went under the rather unpleasant name of &lt;em&gt;Suicide&lt;/em&gt;, in 1980. &lt;em&gt;Suicide&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt; only after &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; had been released and become an arcade sensation, and Bratsanos had started at the University of Washington the following fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was it that his friend actually described to him back in 1980? The best candidate is &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20201218180327/https://www.mobygames.com/game/space-panic&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Panic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a largely forgotten Japanese stand-up arcade game from that year which would seem to be the first ever example of the evergreen genre that would become known as the platformer.  Not only did &lt;em&gt;Space Panic&lt;/em&gt; have you running and climbing your way through a vertical labyrinth, but it also allowed you to dig holes in it to trap your enemies, just like &lt;em&gt;Suicide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kong&lt;/em&gt;, and finally &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Space Panic&lt;/em&gt; was not a commercial success, perhaps because it asked for too much too soon from an audience still enthused with simpler fare like &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;; it was reported that the average session with it lasted all of 30 seconds. But it does appear that it entranced one anonymous teenage boy enough that he told his buddy James Bratsanos all about it. And from that random conversation — from that butterfly flapping its wings, one might say — eventually stemmed one of the biggest games of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4509&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/705920-space-panic-arcade-screenshot-lets-go/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4509&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4509&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4509&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/705920-space-panic-arcade-screenshot-lets-go.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;256&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4509&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Panic&lt;/em&gt;, the 1980 standup-arcade game at the root of the &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it isn’t quite an immaculate creation, &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant one, a classic lesson in the way that fiendish complexity can arise out of deceptive simplicity in game design. It offers just six verbs — move left, right, up, or down; dig left or right — combined with only slightly more nouns — platforms of diggable brick or impenetrable metal, ladders, trap doors, overhead poles for shimmying, monks, treasures. And yet from this disarmingly short list of ingredients arises a well-nigh infinite buffet of devious possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; does retain some vestiges of its arcade inspirations in the form of a score and limited lives, it’s as much a puzzle or even a strategy game as an action game at heart. (Your lives are essentially meaningless in the end; you can save your progress at any point.) Playing each level entails first experimenting and dying — dying &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; — until you can devise a thoroughgoing plan for how to tackle it. Then, it’s just a matter of executing the plan perfectly; this is where the action elements come into play. The levels in &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; are dynamic enough that getting through them doesn’t require stumbling across a single rote, set-piece solution envisioned by the designer; there’s space here for player creativity, space for variation, space for quick thinking that gets you out of an unanticipated jam — or that fails to do so just when you believe you’re on the brink of victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The levels build upon one another, each one training you for what’s still to come as it forces you to think about your limited menu of verbs and nouns in new ways. This sort of progressive design was not a hallmark of most computer games of 1983, and thus serves to make &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; stand out all the more. The world would arguably have to wait until the release of DMA Designs’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/games-on-the-mersey-part-5-the-lemmings-effect&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1991 to play another action-puzzler that was its equal in terms of design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in &lt;em&gt;Lemmings&lt;/em&gt;, every single detail of &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;‘s implementation becomes relevant as the levels become more complex, from the timing of events in the environment to the rudimentary but completely predictable artificial intelligence of the monks. Consider: the pits you drill are automatically filled in again after ten seconds, while monks climb out of pits into which they’ve fallen in just a few seconds. But what would happen if you could time things so that a pit is filled in while a monk is still inside it? The monk would get buried there permanently, that’s what, giving you a precious reprieve before the replacement who is spawned at the very top of the screen makes his way down to you once again. By the time you reach level 30 or so, you’ll be actively using the monks as your helpmates, taking advantage of the fact that they too like to pick up gold — for there’s now gold in places which you can’t reach, meaning you must depend on them to be your delivery men. Once one of them has what you need, you just need to make him fall into a pit, then walk on his head to steal the booty. Easy peasy, right? If you think so, don’t worry: there’s still 120 levels to go, each one more insidiously intricate than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, when you’re done with all 150 levels, there’s still the level editor. Even by the standards of today, the original Apple II &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; provides a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of content. By the standards of 1983, its generosity was mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phenomenal game by any standard, &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; became a phenomenon of another sort in the months after its release. Doug Smith, a private, retiring fellow who loathed the spotlight, nevertheless became a household name among hardcore gamers, joining the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2013/02/the-pinball-wizard&quot;&gt;Bill Budge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2011/12/lord-british&quot;&gt;Richard Garriott&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/2015/08/nasir-gebelli-and-early-days-of-sirius.html&quot;&gt;Nasir Gebelli&lt;/a&gt; as one of the last of the Apple II scene’s auteur-programmer stars. At a time when a major hit was a game that sold 50,000 copies, his game sold in the hundreds of thousands on the Apple II and in ports to the Commodore 64, the IBM PC, and virtually every other commercially viable computer platform under the sun. First it became &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Apple II game of 1983; then it became &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; game of whatever year it happened to be ported to each other platform, collecting award after award almost by default. And then there was Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4505&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/lrbw1_0/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4505&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4505&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4505&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lrbw1_0-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lrbw1_0-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lrbw1_0.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4505&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; appeared on the Macintosh soon after that machine’s release in 1984. Although the construction set was a a natural fit for that machine’s GUI, the actual game proved less satisfying. “What used to be a struggle strictly between the commando and the Bungeling guards is now also a battle between you and the [mouse] pointer,” wrote &lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Such complaints would become something of a theme: Apple II purists insist to this day that no Lode Runner has ever played quite as well as the one that Doug Smith personally programmed for their favorite platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Doug Carlston’s smartest moves in the early days of Brøderbund was to forge links with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/07/japan&quot;&gt;burgeoning software and gaming scene in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. He was particularly chummy with Yuji Kudo, the founder of Hudson Soft, Japan’s biggest software publisher of all. (A model-train enthusiast extraordinaire, Kudo took his company’s very un-Japanese name from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-6-4&quot;&gt;his favorite type of steam locomotive&lt;/a&gt;.) The two men already had a deal in place to bring &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; to Japan even before it was released in the United States. During the summer of 1983, it became one of the first ten games to be made available for the Nintendo Famicom — the videogame console that would later conquer the world as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/04/generation-nintendo&quot;&gt;Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2012/03/the-wizardry-phenomenon&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wizardry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/06/peter-molyneuxs-kingdom-in-a-box&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after it, &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; turned into that rarest of birds, a Western videogame which the Japanese embraced with all the fannish obsessiveness of which they’re capable — which is, to be clear, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of obsessiveness indeed. Before there was &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; to drive sales of Nintendo consoles all over the world, there was &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; to get the ball rolling in Japan itself. Sales of the game in Japan alone topped 1 million in the first eighteen months, prompting one journalist to declare &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; Japan’s new “national pastime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; mania reached its peak in the summer of 1985, when Hudson Soft, Brøderbund, and Sony joined forces to sponsor a national competition in the game. Of the 3700 players between the ages of nine and fourteen who entered the competition, 50 became finalists, invited to come to Tokyo and play the game on what was at that time the largest video screen in the world, 86 feet in width. A slightly uncomfortable-looking Doug Smith, coaxed into the spotlight by Brøderbund’s marketers, presided over the affair and even agreed to join the competition. (He didn’t last very long.) “I like the people of Japan,” he said. “There’s an honesty among the people that is so refreshing — they would never think of pirating computer games, for instance.” (A more likely explanation for &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;‘s high sales in Japan than the people’s innate honesty was, of course, the fact that piracy on the cartridge-based Famicom was a possibility for only the most technically adept.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4504&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/contest2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4504&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4504&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4504&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/contest2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;259&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/contest2.jpg 259w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/contest2-225x300.jpg 225w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4504&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A rare shot of Doug Smith in person, giving prizes to the winners of the Japanese &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By decade’s end, &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;‘s worldwide sales had topped 2.5 million copies. I can hardly emphasize enough what &lt;em&gt;absurdly&lt;/em&gt; high figures these are for a game first sold on the humble Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take Brøderbund’s generous royalty and combine it with sales like this, then reckon in the fact that &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; was essentially a one-man production, you wind up with one very wealthy young game programmer. Still in his early twenties, Doug Smith found himself in the enviable position of never having to work another day in his life. He bought, according to his friend Rick LaMont, “a Porche 911 Carrera, a Bayliner speedboat, a house in Issaquah, and a wife (as a colleague once joked).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of temptations like these, Doug Smith became one of a number of early Apple II auteurs, such as the aforementioned Bill Budge and Nasir Gebelli, who weren’t able to sustain their creative momentum as lone-wolf developers became teams and the title of game designer slowly separated itself from that of game programmer. He did provide Brøderbund with one &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; sequel of a sort: &lt;em&gt;Championship Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt;, with 50 new levels that had mostly been sent to the company by fans and that were (correctly) advertised as picking up in difficulty right where the first game had left off. But its technology and graphics were barely tweaked, and the decision to aim it exclusively at the hardest-core of the hardcore put a natural limit on its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, there followed several year of silence from Smith, off enjoying his riches and pondering the strange course his life had taken, from starving student to wealthy man of leisure in a matter of months. And truly, his is a story that could only have happened at this one brief window in time, when videogames had become popular enough to sell in the millions but could still be made by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as they did with &lt;em&gt;Wizardry&lt;/em&gt;, the impatient Japanese soon took &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; into their own hands, making and releasing a string of sequels in their country that would never appear elsewhere. But what ought to have been a natural ongoing franchise remained oddly under-served by Brøderbund in its country of origin; they released only one more under-realized, under-promoted sequel, for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit line only, created by their recently purchased subsidiary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2014/03/mindwhell-or-the-poet-and-the-hackers&quot;&gt;Synapse Software&lt;/a&gt; without Smith’s involvement. Perhaps they were just too busy turning all those other products into icons of their era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until 1994, when Brøderbund’s ten-year option expired and all rights to the game and its trademarks reverted to Smith, that anyone attempted a full-fledged revival in the United States. Irony of ironies, the company behind said revival was Sierra, finally getting their chance with a game that had slipped through their fingers a decade before. The project was driven by Jeff Tunnell, the founder of what was now the Sierra subsidiary known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/05/the-dynamic-interactive-narratives-of-dynamix&quot;&gt;Dynamix&lt;/a&gt;, who had just made the classic puzzler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/the-incredible-machine&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Incredible Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lode Runner: The Legend Returns&lt;/em&gt; was a symbol of everything that was right and wrong with the games industry of the mid-1990s. Dynamix added beautiful hand-painted backgrounds and a stereo soundtrack to the old formula, but in the minds of many the new version just didn’t &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; as well as the old; it had something to do with the timing, something to do with the unavoidably different &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of a 1990s 32-bit computer game versus the vintage 8-bit variety — and perhaps something to do as well with Tunnell’s decision to add a lot more surface complexity to the elegantly simple mix of the original, including locks and keys, snares, gas traps, bombs, jackhammers, buckets of goo, and even light and darkness. &lt;em&gt;The Legend Returns&lt;/em&gt; did reasonably well for Sierra, but never became the phenomenon that the original had been in its home country. And as for Japan… well, it now preferred homegrown platformers that featured a certain Italian plumber. The various revivals since have generally met the same fate: polite interest, decent sales, but no return to the full-blown &lt;em&gt;Lode Runner&lt;/em&gt; mania of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4508&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37.755102040816&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/loderunn_000/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4508&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4508&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4508&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loderunn_000-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loderunn_000-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loderunn_000.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4508&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lode Runner: The Legend Returns&lt;/em&gt; definitely looks a lot more impressive than the original, which was far from an audiovisual wonder even in its own time. Opinions are at best divided, however, on whether it plays better. One can detect the influence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/03/lemmings-2-the-tribes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in its diverse, ever-shifting collection of obstacles and affordances, but the end result is somehow less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith did return to playing an active role in the games industry in the 1990s, working as the producer of a couple of Nintendo games among other things. He disappeared from view once again after the millennium, presumably occupying himself mostly with the raising of his five children. He died in 2014 at the age of just 53, of a cause that has never been publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Internet Is for Porn</title>
<link>https://themargins.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-for-porn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://themargins.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-for-porn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi. This post is written by a friend of Margins, who happens to be a product executive at a public tech company. He wrote this initially in September 2020, but we were hesitant to publish it anonymously. Nevertheless, our friend turned out to be very insightful and we thought it’d be a shame (hah!) not to share his wisdom. It’s not like we’ve never written about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://themargins.substack.com/p/twitter-george-soros-and-porn&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest and most interesting things happening in the consumer web right now is running almost completely under the radar. It has virtually zero Silicon Valley involvement. There are no boastful VCs getting rich. It is utterly absent from tech’s plethora of twitters, fora and media (at least, as they say, “on main”). Indeed, the true extent of its incredible success has gone almost completely unnoticed, even by its many, many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking, of course, about OnlyFans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans, the content subscription service that has come to be dominated by sex workers, has only been around since 2016. It works a bit like Instagram-meets-Patreon, or perhaps Twitch - for porn. Users pay to follow content creators and unlock exclusive material. The applications to porn are pretty obvious, and unlike its more prudish cousins, OnlyFans has openly embraced adult content creators. “OF” gives creators an array of tools for monetizing their audiences, with not only different subscription tiers, but ways to allow paying customers to directly interact with creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans was already growing steadily before COVID, but the platform has absolutely exploded during the pandemic in a manner of “hypergrowth” fantasy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/coronavirus-amateur-porn-onlyfans&quot;&gt;According to their CEO&lt;/a&gt;, they were adding nearly 200,000 new users and 8,000 new content creators &lt;em&gt;a day&lt;/em&gt; back in May, and have only continued to grow since&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The platform now has north of 700,000 content creators (!) serving a customer base of over &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/influencer-onlyfans-sex-work/&quot;&gt;50 million registered users&lt;/a&gt; (!!). Hard stats are hard to come by, but one figure pegged the cumulative total paid out to creators at $725 million as of May. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364910/cardi-b-onlyfans-wap-behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Cardi B joined the platform&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, OnlyFans is for real. It’s becoming not just the next generation of porn, but it might just represent a quantum leap in fixing one of the world’s most popular industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Silicon Valley has almost nothing to do with it. The reasons why are worth reflecting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No, really - the internet is for porn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me stop here and say: if you’re uncomfortable with pornography, it’s better to just stop reading right here. I am unashamed to be a casual porn consumer. In this, I am extremely normal. Volumes of research show that nearly all men - old and young, married and single, straight, gay and everywhere along the spectrum - consume porn on occasion. While a majority of porn consumers are men, a huge number of women are watching, too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2019-year-in-review&quot;&gt;Pornhub reports&lt;/a&gt; that about a third of its American audience are women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giggles, eye-rolls and the occasional moral scold aside, porn is a gigantic industry that serves an equally enormous popular demand. The cavernous disparity between the demonstrably massive popularity of porn and our popular unwillingness to even acknowledge it exists is a truly bizarre facet of American puritanical culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the oft-cited stat that porn is a third of all internet traffic is probably a myth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/201611/dueling-statistics-how-much-the-internet-is-porn&quot;&gt;search engine companies say&lt;/a&gt; it represents about 10-15% of all queries. That’s a lot! Pornhub alone received &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/corona-virus&quot;&gt;about 120 million unique visitors a day&lt;/a&gt; even &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; COVID forced everyone indoors. By comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2020/02/19/cnn-digital-breaks-all-records-largest-digital-audience-in-history-in-january-2020/&quot;&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt; a record-breaking 148 million uniques in the &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt; of January. (Fox News had only 104 million.) No one’s quite sure how large the entire porn industry is, but it’s safely assumed to be in the $5 billion range at least - around a third the size of the global video game industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, porn is a huge, popular and extremely mainstream industry - which people insist on not talking about and enjoying in private. (Or maybe in a private browser window.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The porn industry itself has long been famously problematic. Like many industries that rely on talent that is often young and naive, greedy middlemen (almost always men) who control production and channels of distribution take all the upside for themselves. A perfect example is porn mega-name Mia Khalifa, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/16/mia-khalifa-is-among-worlds-most-watched-women-yet-porn-industry-is-keeping-profits/&quot;&gt;was paid a grand total of $12,000&lt;/a&gt; for only a handful of shoots - a tiny, tiny fraction of the value her content has generated for distributors like Pornhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free porn sites - Pornhub chief among them - have done to the porn industry what Facebook and Google did to ad-supported media. By aggregating demand for “free” porn, they vacuumed up all the ad revenue that had once kept studios and distributors (not to mention the stars) in business while demolishing any reason to pay for their content. You can buy a subscription to sites like Pornhub, of course, but that doesn’t really solve the problem; it’s a bit like buying a subscription to Facebook to read the newspaper. While some porn actors/actresses have been able to build personal brands to monetize their content, this is an extremely difficult process. For sex workers must not only face all the normal challenges to creating unique identities online, but they must do it with an openly hostile Silicon Valley fighting them at every step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn’t hyperbole. At almost every turn, the tech industry has gone out of its way to penalize, marginalize and - yes - “cancel” sex workers, the overwhelming majority of whom are women responding to ravenous male demand. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz7b4k/how-sex-workers-get-paid&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/quiet-war-rages-who-can-make-money-online/&quot;&gt;Venmo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/quiet-war-rages-who-can-make-money-online/&quot;&gt;Stripe, Square&lt;/a&gt; and almost every other payments service shuts down their accounts. Twitter shadowbans them while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/tumblrs-adult-content-ban-pushes-power-users-to-twitter-patreon.html&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-50222380&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/debug/snapchat-porn-banned/&quot;&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; either over-enforce rules or ban adult content accounts entirely. The Big Blue App, of course, doesn’t permit adult content at all - and neither does Apple or Google’s App Stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An observer might note that all of these companies are dominated by men, in an industry dominated by men, tightly interwoven with a venture capital industry that is super-dominated by men. So it’s curious why none of these men have shown any interest in addressing the massive and lucrative sex work industry that overwhelmingly serves, well, men; until you consider who pays the real costs of that industry’s brokenness: women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Silicon Valley’s blind spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would more women in positions of power in Silicon Valley’s tech giants and top VC firms ever have funded an OnlyFans service or its like? It’s hard to say. The cultural taboos around porn are powerful - so powerful that they’ve kept an American redoubt of hyper-capitalism from even sniffing at a gigantic industry badly in need of innovation. Also, part of the sexist constructs of femininity that women operate in include ideas of purity and moral rectitude that might have discouraged them from even broaching the topic. Or maybe not. We don’t really know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we do know: plenty of the men who have waged war on sex workers’ livelihoods from positions of enormous power in tech also consume porn and even personally hire those same sex workers. Yet when you combine American prudishness with the tech industry’s obsession with polishing mostly-male personal brands, the Valley’s refusal to consider legitimate sex worker needs becomes easier to understand. It’s unlikely that the engineers, product managers and executives who made those product decisions that upended sex workers’ lives ever understood, or perhaps even considered, their impacts. Or if they did, it seems that sex workers are considered expendable users. (Again, at least in public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has created a large digital underclass of sex workers - including, but far from limited to, adult performers - who live in fear of being banned by the big tech platforms while simply doing their jobs. The vast majority are women serving a heterosexual male audience. Most of them do nothing illegal at all, but they operate in the long shadow of those powerful (and powerfully sexist) cultural taboos and their resulting hypocritical popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not have taken a market strategy genius to spot an opening for OnlyFans here: a high-quality digital platform where adult performers can capture &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elle.com/culture/a32459935/onlyfans-sex-work-influencers/&quot;&gt;the lion’s share of value&lt;/a&gt; for their own content. And indeed, there have been other similar attempts to do this (again, ignored by mainstream tech). But what OnlyFans figured out was that to pry open consumers’ willingness to pay for porn again, they needed to offer exclusive content and the ability to interact with performers, as well as a way for creators to brand-build on their platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular performer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl&quot;&gt;Aella&lt;/a&gt;, who makes something on the order of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1301613151381860357?s=20&quot;&gt;$100,000 a month on OnlyFans&lt;/a&gt;, discussed some of her specific monetization strategies in this fascinating (and SFW) interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OnlyFans takes off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans’ 20% cut of its creators’ revenues might be most usefully compared to Patreon’s 10% take-rate. Despite that big bite (which OnlyFans says really amounts to 12% after merchant fees and processing), OnlyFans has nevertheless scaled to roughly three-quarters of a billion in payouts in not quite 4 years, with no evident external funding. (OnlyFans is not even listed on Crunchbase). By contrast, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.patreon.com/thankyoupatrons-all-4-million-of-you-2019&quot;&gt;took Patreon 6 years&lt;/a&gt;, and $166 million (!) in venture funding, to reach $1 billion from 4 million “patrons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of these two companies sounds more successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, OnlyFans is not perfect. They are dealing with growth pains like subscriber churn, spam, creators who have trouble getting their payouts and a back tax problem. There are also the usual creator discovery problems that almost all influencer platforms encounter. It can be difficult for adult performers in particular to market themselves, given the strict rules about their content on many social platforms discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, OnlyFans has distinguished itself not only by helping a very large number of sex workers make an honest living, but by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1303028659154894849?s=20&quot;&gt;treating them like first-class citizens&lt;/a&gt; rather than a scourge. In doing so, it’s not only saving the porn industry, but demonstrating how to make it a better, safer and more equitable place by aligning incentives for consumers and creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakout success of OnlyFans is laudable, but should prompt some soul-searching in the power centers of Silicon Valley. Why did it take this long? Why would no one else have the courage to address sex work? Why does the same industry that exalts such morally ruinous firms as Palantir, Facebook and Palmer Lucky’s actual next-gen weapons startup get queasy about consenting adults wanting to see naked bodies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if they missed this market opportunity, think about how many more are out there - invisible only to the affluent men who run “tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnote: Pornhub’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pornhub.com/insights/&quot;&gt;Insights blog&lt;/a&gt; (SFW) is chock-full of incredible insights about global porn interests that their analytics team puts together. Yes, people are searching for “coronavirus porn”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Starting Sunday, cable companies can no longer ‘rent’ you the router you own</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22191096/internet-modem-router-rental-fee-fix-television-viewer-protection-act-tvpa</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22191096/internet-modem-router-rental-fee-fix-television-viewer-protection-act-tvpa</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;CvZZbv&quot;&gt;Is your internet service provider charging you every month for the cable modem or router that &lt;em&gt;you purchased with your own money?&lt;/em&gt; Or, perhaps, have you never bothered to buy those items because you couldn’t escape the fee? That fee will be illegal starting Sunday, December 20th, and you should tell your ISP that you’ll no longer tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;77hB1R&quot;&gt;Last year, Congress passed a law that should have fixed this ridiculous loophole as of June 20th, 2020 — and though the FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280188/fcc-deadline-isps-charge-customer-equipment-date&quot;&gt;managed to extend the deadline six months&lt;/a&gt; by spinning up some bullshit about how cable companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200604/09392344642/fcc-delays-law-banning-your-isp-charging-you-rental-fees-hardware-you-already-own.shtml&quot;&gt;didn’t have the resources &lt;em&gt;to stop charging you money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the law should take full effect tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t4hyj7&quot;&gt;Do note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5035/text#H9D3FC644679E4CEFB927457B4310C9D3&quot;&gt;the actual text of the law&lt;/a&gt; still allows some BS to occur. If your ISP sends you a router, you’ll need to return it to avoid charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;5p6YK3&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Whether you use it or not”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mi0KFW&quot;&gt;Frontier in particular has been notorious for charging customers $10 a month for their equipment “whether you use it or not” — the company’s words, not mine — but Frontier is clearly aware it won’t be able to do that anymore. Starting this month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffrontier.com%2Fhelpcenter%2Fcategories%2Finternet%2Finstallation-setup%2Ffrontier-router&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F19%2F22191096%2Finternet-modem-router-rental-fee-fix-television-viewer-protection-act-tvpa#donotlink&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; has-subtag=&quot;true&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;subtag_max_length&amp;quot;:50,&amp;quot;subtag_delim_length&amp;quot;:3,&amp;quot;subtag_key&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;xcust&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;subtag_query_data&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;66960X1514734&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;xs&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://frontier.com/helpcenter/categories/internet/installation-setup/frontier-router&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;referrer&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;theverge.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sref&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22191096/internet-modem-router-rental-fee-fix-television-viewer-protection-act-tvpa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;xcust&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;___vg__e_21955137__r_r-placeholder__t_w__d_d-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__m_m-placeholder__c_c-placeholder&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;encode_subtag&amp;quot;:false}&quot;&gt;the company’s equipment page&lt;/a&gt; has changed to remove the part where it talks about the mandatory fee. &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20201112030707/https://frontier.com/helpcenter/categories/internet/installation-setup/compatible-routers-and-modems&quot;&gt;Here’s an archived copy of the site from last month&lt;/a&gt; if you want to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;avgFrr&quot;&gt;If you can purchase your own cable modem, I suggest you do. Modems will generally pay for themselves in less than a year, and the all-in-one router boxes that ISPs typically provide typically offer worse Wi-Fi coverage than you could easily add to a house yourself, particularly now that mesh Wi-Fi systems are better, cheaper, and easier to use than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;uDvvDa&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;sEJ0gn&quot;&gt;It also doesn’t help that in the US, we pay roughly eight to 17 times more to rent a modem on average that Asia and Europe do, respectively. That’s just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc&quot;&gt;one of the ways America’s internet needs to be fixed in 2021.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;25.789473684211&quot;&gt;I wanted to share the status with the Owncast project. If Wordpress is your self-hosted version of Medium, then this is your self-hosted version of Twitch.
&lt;p&gt;I've been little by little chipping away at building an easy to use and super useful live streaming server for individuals. It's still early days, but some recent updates include a dashboard where you can see some basic viewer metrics, configuration settings, and how your hardware is handling all that video crunching. We all know working with video can be intensive on the hardware side, so hopefully this helps people keep tabs on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a demo server if you're curious what it's like. But if you're a streamer, or even have a little interest in the space, I'd love for you to give it a spin. Feedback is highly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the project check out the documentation, and of course all the source, issues and additional discussion are over on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple M1 foreshadows Rise of RISC-V</title>
<link>https://erik-engheim.medium.com/apple-m1-foreshadows-risc-v-dd63a62b2562</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://erik-engheim.medium.com/apple-m1-foreshadows-risc-v-dd63a62b2562</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;9d61&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Likewise with these interrupts we can send complex machine learning tasks to the M1 Neural Engine to say identify a face on the WebCam. Simultaneously the rest of the computer is responsive because the Neural Engine is chewing through the image data in parallel to everything else the CPU is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

RISC-V based board from SiFive capable of running Linux

&lt;p id=&quot;080f&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Back in 2010 at UC Berkley the Parallel Computing Laboratory saw the development towards heavier use of coprocessors. They saw how the end of Moore’s Law meant that you could no longer easily squeeze more performance out of general purpose CPU cores. You needed specialized hardware: Coprocessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;536e&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Let us reflect momentarily on why that is. We know that the clock frequency cannot easily be increased. We are stuck on close to 3–5 GHz. Go higher and Watt consumption and heat generation goes through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;efe8&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;However we are able to add a lot more transistors. We simply cannot make the transistors work faster. Thus we need to do more work in parallel. One way to do that is by adding lots of general purpose cores. We could add lots of decoders and do Out-of-Order Execution (OoOE) as I have discussed before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Why Is Apple’s M1 Chip So Fast?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ca5f&quot; class=&quot;ma kn fq av ko me mf gp kr mg mh gs ku gt mi gv ky gw mj gy lc gz mk hb lg ml dz&quot;&gt;Transistor Budget: CPU Cores or Coprocessors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5444&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;You can keep playing that game and eventually you have 128 general cores like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amperecomputing.com/ampere-altra-family-of-cloud-native-processors-expands-to-128-cores-with-altra-max/&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Ampere Altra Max ARM processor&lt;/a&gt;. But is that really the best use of our silicon? For servers in the cloud that is great. One can probably keep all those 128 cores busy with various client requests. However a desktop system may not be able to effectively use more than 8-cores on common desktop workloads. Thus if you go to say 32 cores, you are wasting silicon on lots of cores which will sit idle most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;18c9&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Instead of spending all that silicon on more CPU cores, perhaps we can add more coprocessors instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8b7d&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Think about it this way: You got a transistor budget. In the early days, maybe you had a budget of 20 000 transistors and you figured you could make a CPU with 15 000 transistors. That is close to reality in the early 80s. Now this CPU could do maybe 100 different tasks. Say making a specialized coprocessor to one of these tasks cost you 1000 transistors. If you made a coprocessor for every task you would get to 100 000 transistors. That would blow your budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3c13&quot; class=&quot;ma kn fq av ko me mf gp kr mg mh gs ku gt mi gv ky gw mj gy lc gz mk hb lg ml dz&quot;&gt;Transistor Abundance Change Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aec9&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Thus in early designs one needed to focus on general purpose computing. But today, we can stuff chips with so many transistors, we hardly know what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;40d1&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Thus designing coprocessors has become a big thing. A lot of research goes into making all sorts of new coprocessors. However these tend to contain pretty dumb accelerators which needed to be babied. Unlike a CPU they cannot read instructions which tells them all the steps to do. They don’t generally know how to access memory and organize anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2482&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Thus the common solution to this is to have a simple CPU as a sort of controller. So the whole coprocessor is some specialized accelerator circuit controlled by a simple CPU, which configures the accelerator to do its job. Usually this is highly specialized. For instance, something like a Neural Engine or Tensor Processing Unit deal with very large registers that can hold matrices (rows and columns of numbers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2a39&quot; class=&quot;ma kn fq av ko me mf gp kr mg mh gs ku gt mi gv ky gw mj gy lc gz mk hb lg ml dz&quot;&gt;RISC-V Was Tailored Made to Control Accelerators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ac52&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;This is exactly what RISC-V got designed for. It has a bare minimum instruction-set of about 40–50 instructions which lets it do all the typical CPU stuff. It may sound like a lot, but keep in mind that an x86 CPU has over 1500 instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3869&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Instead of having a large fixed instruction-set, RISC-V is designed around the idea of extensions. Every coprocessor will be different. It will thus contain a RISC-V processor to manage things which implements the core instruction-set as well as an extension instruction-set tailor made for what that co-processor needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b866&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Okay, now maybe you start to see the contours of what I am getting at. Apple’s M1 is really going to push the industry as whole towards this coprocessor dominated future. And to make these coprocessors, RISC-V will be an important part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;67bd&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;But why? Can’t everybody making a coprocessor just invent their own instruction-set? After all that is what I think Apple has done. Or possibly they use ARM. I have no idea. If somebody knows, please drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;abfc&quot; class=&quot;ma kn fq av ko me mf gp kr mg mh gs ku gt mi gv ky gw mj gy lc gz mk hb lg ml dz&quot;&gt;What is the Benefit of Sticking with RISC-V for Coprocessors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b999&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Making chips have become a complicated and costly affair. Building up tools to verify your chip. Run tests programs, diagnosis and a host of other things requires a lot of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ddf0&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;This is part of the value of going with ARM today. They have a large ecosystem of tools to help verify your design and test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;97f6&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Going for custom proprietary instruction-sets is thus not a good idea. However with RISC-V there is a standard which multiple companies can make tools for. Suddenly there is an eco-system and multiple companies can share the burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;16cc&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;But why not just use ARM which is already there? You see ARM is made as a general purpose CPU. It has a large fixed instruction-set. After pressure from customers and RISC-V competition ARM has relented and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eetasia.com/arm-opens-instruction-set-architecture/&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;2019 opened its instruction-set for extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;553d&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Still the problem is that it wasn’t made for this from the onset. The whole ARM toolchain is going to assume you got the whole large ARM instruction set implemented. That is fine for the main CPU of a Mac or an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;620f&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;But for a coprocessor you don’t want or need this large instruction-set. You want an eco-system of tools that have been built around the idea of a minimal fixed base instruction-set with extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6db9&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Why is that such a benefit? &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tue1345pm-NVIDIA-Sijstermans.pdf&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Nvidia’s use of RISC-V offers some insight&lt;/a&gt;. On their big GPUs they need some kind of general purpose CPU to be used as a controller. However the amount of silicon they can set aside for this, and the amount of heath it is allowed to produce is minimal. Keep in mind that lots of things are competing for space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;mq&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c4c8&quot; class=&quot;mr ms fq av mt mu mv mw mx my mz jp bt&quot;&gt;The small and simple instruction-set of RISC-V makes it possible to implement RISC-V cores in much less silicon than ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e169&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn na iy iz gq nb jb jc jd nc jf jg jh nd jj jk jl ne jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Because RISC-V has such a small and simple instruction-set it beats all the competition, including ARM. Nvidia found they could make smaller chips by going for RISC-V than for anybody else. They also reduced watt usage to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2a3b&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Thus with the extension mechanism you can limit yourself to adding only the instructions crucial for the job you need done. A controller for a GPU likely needs other extensions than a controller on an encryption coprocessor e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;6eb2&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Thus ironically we may see a future where Macs and PCs are powered by ARM processors. But where all the custom hardware around them, all their coprocessors will be dominated by RISC-V. As coprocessor get more popular more silicon in your System-on-a-Chip (SoC) may be running RISC-V than ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2542&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Read more: RISC-V: &lt;a class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://erik-engheim.medium.com/risc-v-did-apple-make-the-wrong-choice-7ff6c4a51566&quot;&gt;Did Apple Make the Wrong Choice?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0d2c&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;When I wrote the story above, I had not actually fully grasped what RISC-V was all about. I though the future would be about ARM or RISC-V. Instead it will likely be ARM and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;1a65&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;General purpose ARM processors will be at the center with an army of RISC-V powered coprocessors accelerating every possible task from graphics, encryption, video encoding, machine learning, signal processing to processing network packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6fb3&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Prof. David Patterson and his team at UC Berkeley saw this future coming and that is why RISC-V is so well tailored to meet this new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51ea&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;We are seeing such a massive uptake and buzz around RISC-V in all sorts of specialized hardware and micro-controllers that I think a lot of the areas dominated by ARM today will go RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;

Raspberry Pi 4 Microcontroller, currently using an ARM processor.
&lt;p id=&quot;a6fd&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Imagine something like Raspberry Pi. Now it runs ARM. But future RISC-V variants could offer a host of variants tailored for different needs. There could be machine learning microcontrollers. Another can be image processing oriented. A third could be for encryption. Basically you could pick your own a little micro-controller with its own little flavor. You may be able to run Linux on it and do all the same tasks, except the performance profile will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d217&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;RISC-V microcontrollers with special machine learning instructions will train neural networks faster than the RISC-V microcontroller with instructions for video encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7954&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Nvidia has already ventured down that path with their Jetson Nano, shown below. It is a Raspberry Pi sized microcontroller with specialized hardware for machine learning, so you can do object detection, speech recognition and other machine learning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit.

&lt;p id=&quot;3baa&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Many ask: Why not replace ARM entirely with RISC-V? While others claim that this would never work because RISC-V has a “puny and simple” instruction-set which cannot deliver the kind of high performance that ARM and x86 offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a1c1&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Yes, you could use RISC-V as the main processor. No, performance is not stopping us from doing it. Just like with ARM, we just need somebody to make a high performance RISC-V chip. In fact it may already have been done: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claims-recordbreaking-performance-per-watt/&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;New RISC-V CPU claims recordbreaking performance per watt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4703&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;It has been a common misconception that complex instructions give higher performance. RISC workstations disproved that back in the 90s as they destroyed x86 computers in performance benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;feab&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;How did Intel beat the RISC workstations in the 90s: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/is-it-game-over-for-the-x86-isa-and-intel-5ce1b00fbd1&quot; class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Is It Game Over for the x86 ISA and Intel?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0d15&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;In fact RISC-V has a lot of clever tricks up its sleeve to get high performance: &lt;a class=&quot;do jq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://erik-engheim.medium.com/the-genius-of-risc-v-microprocessors-b19d735abaa6&quot;&gt;The Genius of RISC-V Microprocessors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;de7a&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;In short, there is no reason why your main CPU couldn’t be a RISC-V processor, but this is also a question of momentum. MacOS and Windows already runs on ARM. At least in the short term, it seems questionable that either Microsoft or Apple will spend the effort on doing yet another hardware transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;1d7d&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn li iy iz gq lj jb jc jd lk jf jg jh ll jj jk jl lm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Let me know what you think. There is a lot going on here which is hard to guess. We see e.g. now there are claims of RISC-V CPUs which really beats ARM on watt and performance. This also makes you wonder if there is indeed a chance that RISC-V becomes the central CPU of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ec02&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;I must admit it has not been obvious to me why RISC-V would outperform ARM. By their own admission, RISC-V is a fairly conservative design. They don’t use much instructions which have not already been used in some other older design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b9eb&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;However there seems to be a major gain from pairing everything down to a minimum. It makes it possible to make exceptionally small and simple implementations or RISC-V CPUs. This again makes it possible to reduce Watt usage and increase clock frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5320&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fq iw b gn ix iy iz gq ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp di dz&quot;&gt;Hence the last word on RISC-V and ARM is not yet said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All problems stem from man&amp;#039;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone (2014)</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/19/change-your-life-sit-down-and-think</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/19/change-your-life-sit-down-and-think</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;&quot;All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone,&quot; wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;the French philosopher Blaise Pascal&lt;/a&gt;. It's a line repeated so frequently, in the era of smartphones and social media, that it's easy to forget how striking it is that he wrote it in the 1600s. Back then, a sentence such as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/hands-on-with-yo-the-absurdly-simple-messaging-app/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;Yo&lt;/a&gt; is a messaging app that enables iPhone and Android users to say 'Yo' to their friends&quot; might have got you burned as a witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Yet even in 17th-century France, apparently, people hated being alone with their thoughts so intensely, they'd do almost anything else: play boules, start &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Spanish_War_%281635%29&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;the Franco-Spanish war&lt;/a&gt;, and so on. Still, I'd wager even Pascal would have been disturbed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-07/uov-dsi063014.php&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;a study published recently in Science&lt;/a&gt;, showing that people detest being made to spend six to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think – even to the extent of being willing to give themselves mild electric shocks instead. It's natural to conclude that there's something wrong with such people. Which means, all else being equal, that something's probably wrong with you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Modern humans spend virtually no time on &quot;inward-directed thought&quot;, and not solely because we're too busy: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bls.gov/tus/home.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;in one US survey&lt;/a&gt;, 95% of adults said they'd found time for a leisure activity in the previous 24 hours, but 83% said they'd spent zero time just thinking. The new study, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.virginia.edu/~tdw/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;Timothy Wilson&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia, first asked students to entertain themselves with nothing but their thoughts in an &quot;unadorned room&quot;. Most said they found it hard to concentrate; half found it unpleasant or neutral at best. In further experiments, older people, and those who rarely used smartphones, got similar results. Meanwhile, those given the chance to do something outward-directed, such as reading, enjoyed it far more. And when 42 people got to choose between sitting doing nothing and giving themselves electric shocks, two-thirds of men and a quarter of women chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Are we mad? In his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848505476&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;Back To Sanity&lt;/a&gt;, the Leeds Metropolitan University psychologist Steve Taylor answers: yes. The condition he diagnoses, &quot;humania&quot;, isn't recognised as a disorder, but only because we're all victims, he argues, and it's part of the definition of a mental illness that most people don't have it. The &quot;urge to immerse our attention in external things is so instinctive that we're scarcely aware of it&quot;, he writes. We often speak of emails, tweets and texts as if they're annoyances that we'd eliminate if we could. Yet the truth, of course, is that half the time we're desperate to be distracted, and gladly embrace the interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Taylor's explanation for this puzzle borrows from Buddhism (among other places). We mistake ourselves for individual, isolated beings, trapped within our heads. No wonder we don't dwell on what's inside: that would underline the loneliness of existence, so obviously watching TV is more fun. To sit comfortably with your thoughts first requires seeing that there's a sense in which they're not real. A less new agey way of putting it is simply that you don't need to believe your thoughts. Whereupon they become fun to watch, and the need for distraction subsides. To quote the title of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/sit.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;a book by Sylvia Boorstein&lt;/a&gt;, a meditation teacher: don't just do something, sit there.&lt;/p&gt;
