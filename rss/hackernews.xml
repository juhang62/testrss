<title>Leaked Amazon memo details plan to smear fired warehouse organizer</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Leaked notes from an internal meeting of Amazon leadership obtained by VICE News reveal company executives discussed a plan to smear fired warehouse employee Christian Smalls, calling him “not smart or articulate” as part of a PR strategy to make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we’re trying to protect workers,” wrote Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky in notes from the meeting forwarded widely in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion took place at a daily meeting, which included CEO Jeff Bezos, to update each other on the coronavirus situation. Amazon SVP of Global Corporate Affairs Jay Carney &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/03/29/is-amazon-doing-enough-to-protect-workers-and-customers.cnn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described the purpose to CNN on Sunday:&lt;/a&gt; “We go over the update on what's happening around the world with our employees and with our customers and our businesses. We also spend a significant amount of time just brainstorming about what else we can do” about COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zapolsky’s notes also detailed Amazon’s efforts to buy millions of protective masks to protect its workers from the coronavirus, as well as an effort to begin producing and selling its own masks. So far, the company has secured at least 10 million masks for “our operations guys,” with 25 million more coming from a supplier in the next two weeks, Zapolsky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmea3/amazon-fired-the-warehouse-worker-who-organized-a-walkout-over-coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fired the warehouse worker Smalls on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, after he led a walkout of a number of employees at a Staten Island distribution warehouse. Amazon says he was fired for violating a company-imposed 14-day quarantine after he came into contact with an employee who tested positive for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smalls says the employee who tested positive came into contact with many other workers for longer periods of time before her test came back. He claims he was singled out after pleading with management to sanitize the warehouse and be more transparent about the number of workers who were sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zapolsky’s notes from the meeting detail Amazon’s plan to deal with a wave of bad press and calls for investigations from elected officials following the firing of Smalls. They also show top Amazon brass wanted to make Smalls the focus of its narrative when questioned about worker safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety,” Zapolsky wrote. “Make him the most interesting part of the story, and if possible make him the face of the entire union/organizing movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discussed encouraging Amazon executives to use Smalls to discredit the wider labor movement at Amazon. Employees at the warehouse, known as JFK8, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/employees-at-amazon-s-new-nyc-warehouse-launch-unionization-push&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched an effort to unionize in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his notes, Zapolsky wrote that there was “general agreement” on this point among the other attendees of the meeting. (Zapolsky’s notes also mention SVP of worldwide operations and customer service Dave Clark and SVP of human resources Beth Galetti.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to VICE News, Zapolsky said his “comments were personal and emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians by repeatedly returning to the premises after having been warned to quarantine himself after exposure to virus Covid-19,” he said. “I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes also reference Amazon’s concerns about the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the economy, and its own efforts to ramp up testing and lab capacity both within the company and around the country. They discussed the benefits of testing all employees, even asymptomatic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That can have benefits both for the system and for our employees,” Zapolsky wrote. “Every test we do is incremental and is one less test that existing resources have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon also weighed ways to generate a PR win from their mask stockpile with “different and bold” ways of giving away surplus masks to hospitals and independent grocers. “If we can get masks in quantity it’s a fantastic gift if we donate strategically,” Zapolsky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another idea for giving masks away — give 1,000 masks to every police station in the country,” Zapolsky wrote, adding this “reminds folks it’s not just medical workers who need these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discussed alternative ways to obtain or produce protective masks, as well as working with other companies that have capacity to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are ways of making FDA approved surgical and other masks from fabric and we’re working with those manufacturers as well,” Zapolsky’s notes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus at the meeting was that the CDC would be recommending everyone wear masks if not for the lack of supply. “CDC’s hesitancy to recommend masks has been to manage supply (though that’s a bad reason to sacrifice scientific integrity),” Zapolsky wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has also begun efforts to to produce masks itself. While the company has a “line of sight” on a supply of N95 masks, the notes said, Amazon is “starting to put together internal efforts” for mask production, though this is described as “more of a nine month type project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zapolsky’s notes imply the company’s attempts to purchase N95 masks from China fell through. “China has deemed N95 masks as ‘strategic,’” Zapolsky wrote. “They’re keeping them for optionality. They also want to use them for ‘diplomacy.’ The masks in China that we thought we had probably got redirected by profiteers.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘War Dialing’ tool exposes Zoom’s password problems</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/war-dialing-tool-exposes-zooms-password-problems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/war-dialing-tool-exposes-zooms-password-problems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to force people to work from home, countless companies are now holding daily meetings using videoconferencing services from &lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;. But without the protection of a password, there’s a decent chance your next Zoom meeting could be “Zoom bombed” — attended or disrupted by someone who doesn’t belong. And according to data gathered by a new automated Zoom meeting discovery tool dubbed “&lt;strong&gt;zWarDial&lt;/strong&gt;,” a crazy number of meetings at major corporations are not being protected by a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51183&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardial-red1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-51183&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardial-red1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;569&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;zWarDial, an automated tool for finding non-password protected Zoom meetings. According to its makers, zWarDial can find on average 110 meetings per hour, and has a success rate of around 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Zoom conference call is assigned a Meeting ID that consists of 9 to 11 digits. Naturally, hackers have figured out they can simply guess or automate the guessing of random IDs within that space of digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security experts at &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/zoom-zoom-we-are-watching-you/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;did exactly that last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and found they were able to predict approximately four percent of randomly generated Meeting IDs. The Check Point researchers said enabling passwords on each meeting was the only thing that prevented them from randomly finding a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom responded by saying it was enabling passwords by default in all future scheduled meetings. Zoom also said it would block repeated attempts to scan for meeting IDs, and that it would no longer automatically indicate if a meeting ID was valid or invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the incidence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Zoombombing&lt;/a&gt; has skyrocketed over the past few weeks, even prompting an alert by the FBI on how to secure meetings against eavesdroppers and mischief-makers. This suggests that many Zoom users have disabled passwords by default and/or that Zoom’s new security feature simply isn’t working as intended for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New data and acknowledgments by Zoom itself suggest the latter may be more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/surbo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trent Lo&lt;/a&gt;, a security professional and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seckc.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SecKC&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas City’s longest-running monthly security meetup. Lo and fellow SecKC members recently created &lt;strong&gt;zWarDial&lt;/strong&gt;, which borrows part of its name from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1r_uKOew4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the old phone-based war dialing programs&lt;/a&gt; that called random or sequential numbers in a given telephone number prefix to search for computer modems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo said zWarDial evades Zoom’s attempts to block automated meeting scans by routing the searches through multiple proxies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open-source software that lets users browse the Web anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zoom recently said they fixed this but I’m using a totally different URL and passing a cookie along with that URL,” Lo said, describing part of how the tool works on the back end. “This gives me the [Zoom meeting] room information without having to log in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo said a single instance of zWarDial can find approximately 100 meetings per hour, but that multiple instances of the tool running in parallel could probably discover most of the open Zoom meetings on any given day. Each instance, he said, has a success rate of approximately 14 percent, meaning for each random meeting number it tries, the program has a 14 percent chance of finding an open meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only meetings that are protected by a password are undetectable by zWarDial, Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a password enabled on the meeting is the only thing that defeats it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo shared the output of one day’s worth of zWarDial scanning, which revealed information about nearly 2,400 upcoming or recurring Zoom meetings. That information included the link needed to join each meeting; the date and time of the meeting; the name of the meeting organizer; and any information supplied by the meeting organizer about the topic of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were staggering, and revealed details about Zoom meetings scheduled by some of the world’s largest companies, including major banks, international consulting firms, ride-hailing services, government contractors, and investment ratings firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity is not naming the companies involved, but was able to verify dozens of them by matching the name of the meeting organizer with corporate profiles on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the largest group of companies exposing their Zoom meetings are in the technology sector, and include a number of security and cloud technology vendors. These include at least one tech company that’s taken to social media warning people about the need to password protect Zoom meetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51167&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardialmeetingsbyindustry.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-51167&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardialmeetingsbyindustry.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The distribution of Zoom meetings found by zWarDial, indexed by industry. As depicted above, zWarDial found roughly 2,400 exposed meetings in less than 24 hours. Image: SecKC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A GREMLIN IN THE DEFAULTS?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the preponderance of Zoom meetings exposed by security and technology companies that ostensibly should know better, KrebsOnSecurity asked Zoom whether its approach of adding passwords by default to all new meetings was actually working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply, Zoom said it was investigating the possibility that its password-by-default approach may fail under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zoom strongly encourages users to implement passwords for all of their meetings to ensure uninvited users are not able to join,” the company said in a written statement shared with this author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Passwords for new meetings have been enabled by default since late last year, unless account owners or admins opted out,” the statement continues. “We are looking into unique edge cases to determine whether, &lt;span class=&quot;pullquote pqright&quot;&gt;under certain circumstances, users unaffiliated with an account owner or administrator may not have had passwords switched on by default at the time that change was made.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acknowledgment comes amid a series of security and privacy stumbles for Zoom, which has seen its user base grow exponentially in recent weeks. Zoom founder and chief executive &lt;strong&gt;Eric Yuan&lt;/strong&gt; said in a recent blog post that the maximum number of daily meeting participants — both paid and free — has grown from around 10 million in December to 200 million in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rapid growth has also brought additional scrutiny from security and privacy experts, who’ve found plenty of real and potential problems with the service of late. TechCrunch’s &lt;strong&gt;Zack Whittaker&lt;/strong&gt; has a fairly comprehensive breakdown of them &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/zoom-at-your-own-risk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; not included in that list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/zoom-doom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a story he broke earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in Zoom that were publicly detailed by a former NSA expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom CEO Yuan acknowledged that his company has struggled to keep up with steeply growing demand for its service and with the additional scrutiny that comes with it, saying in a blog post that for the next 90 days all new feature development was being frozen so the company’s engineers could focus on security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave Kennedy&lt;/strong&gt;, a security expert and founder of the security consultancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trustedsec.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;TrustedSec&lt;/a&gt;, penned a lengthy thread on Twitter saying while Zoom certainly has had its share of security and privacy goofs, some in the security community are unnecessarily exacerbating an already tough situation for Zoom and the tens of millions of users who rely on it for day-to-day meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we have here is a company that is relatively easy to use for the masses (comes with its challenges on personal meeting IDs) and is relatively secure,” Kennedy &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HackingDave/status/1245536000819986432&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Yet the industry is making it out to be ‘this is malware’ and you can’t use this. This is extreme. We need to look at the risk specific applications pose and help voice a message of how people can leverage technology and be safe. Dropping zero-days to the media hurts our credibility, sensationalizes fear, and hurts others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there are ways for a company to improve, we should notify them and if they don’t fix their issues, we should call them out,” he continued. “We should not be putting fear into everyone, and leveraging the media as a method to create that fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom’s advice on securing meetings is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033331271-Account-Setting-Update-Password-Default-for-Meeting-and-Webinar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. SecKC’s Lo said organizations using Zoom should &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bry_campbell/status/1244994026413137920&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;avoid posting the Zoom meeting links on social media&lt;/a&gt;, and always require a meeting password when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This should be enabled by default as a new customer or a trial user,” he said. “Legacy organizations will need to check their administration settings to make sure this is enabled. You can also enable ‘Embed password in meeting link for one-click join.’ This prevents an actor from accessing your meeting without losing the usability of sharing a link to join.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Zoom users can disable “Allow participants to join the meeting before the host arrives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have to have this feature enabled at least enable “notify host when participants join the meeting before them,” Lo advised. “This will notify you that someone might be using your meeting without your knowledge. If you must keep your meeting unprotected you should enable ‘Mask phone number in the participant list.’ Using the waiting list feature will prevent unwanted participants from accessing your meeting but it will still expose your meeting details if used without a password.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boeing 787s must be turned off and on every 51 days to prevent &amp;#039;misleading data&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Aviation Administration has ordered Boeing 787 operators to switch their aircraft off and on every 51 days to prevent what it called &quot;several potentially catastrophic failure scenarios&quot; – including the crashing of onboard network switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/US-2020-06-14&quot;&gt;airworthiness directive&lt;/a&gt;, due to be enforced from later this month, orders airlines to power-cycle their B787s before the aircraft reaches the specified days of continuous power-on operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power cycling is needed to prevent stale data from populating the aircraft's systems, a problem that has occurred on different 787 systems in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the directive itself, if the aircraft is powered on for more than 51 days this can lead to &quot;display of misleading data&quot; to the pilots, with that data including airspeed, attitude, altitude and engine operating indications. On top of all that, the stall warning horn and overspeed horn also stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming-sounding situation comes about because, for reasons the directive did not go into, the 787's common core system (CCS) – a Wind River VxWorks realtime OS product, at heart – stops filtering out stale data from key flight control displays. That stale data-monitoring function going down in turn &quot;could lead to undetected or unannunciated loss of common data network (CDN) message age validation, combined with a CDN switch failure&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the problem is simple: power the aircraft down completely before reaching 51 days. It is usual for commercial airliners to spend weeks or more continuously powered on as crews change at airports, or ground power is plugged in overnight while cleaners and maintainers do their thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDN is a Boeing avionics term for the 787's internal Ethernet-based network. It is built to a slightly more stringent aviation-specific standard than common-or-garden Ethernet, that standard being called ARINC 664. More about ARINC 664 can be read &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aim-online.com/products-overview/tutorials/afdx-arinc664p7-tutorial/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airline pilots were sanguine about the implications of the failures when &lt;em&gt;El Reg&lt;/em&gt; asked a handful about the directive. One told us: &quot;Loss of airspeed data combined with engine instrument malfunctions isn't unheard of,&quot; adding that there wasn't really enough information in the doc to decide whether or not the described failure would be truly catastrophic. Besides, he said, the backup speed and attitude instruments are – for obvious reasons – completely separate from the main displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mused that loss of engine indications would make it harder to adopt the fallback drill of setting a known pitch and engine power* setting that guarantees safe straight-and-level flight while the pilots consult checklists and manuals to find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third commented, tongue firmly in cheek: &quot;Anything like that with the aircraft is unhealthy!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous software bug forced airlines to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/01/787_software_bug_can_shut_down_planes_generators/&quot;&gt;power down their 787s every 248 days&lt;/a&gt; for fear that electrical generators could shut down in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus suffers from similar issues with its A350, with a relatively recent but since-patched bug &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/25/a350_power_cycle_software_bug_149_hours/&quot;&gt;forcing power cycles every 149 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staleness persists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unfiltered stale data is a known 787 problem. In 2014 a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire because of the (entirely separate, and since fixed) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/17/faa_grounds_boeing_787_batteries/&quot;&gt;lithium-ion battery problem&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators realised the black boxes &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flightglobal.com/ntsb-details-issues-with-787-flight-and-data-recorder/115282.article&quot;&gt;had been recording false information&lt;/a&gt;, hampering their task, because they were falsely accepting stale old data as up-to-the-second real inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article no_img&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 title=&quot;Have you turned it off and on again? That's the way to stop the plane becoming a brick&quot;&gt;Boeing 787 software bug can shut down planes' generators IN FLIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/01/787_software_bug_can_shut_down_planes_generators/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More seriously, another 787 stale data problem in years gone by saw superseded backup flight plans persisting in standby navigation computers, and activating occasionally. Activation caused the autopilot to wrongly decide it was halfway through flying a previous journey – and manoeuvre to regain the &quot;correct&quot; flight path. Another symptom was for the flight management system to simply go blank and freeze, triggered by selection of a standard arrival path (STAR) with exactly 14 waypoints – such as the BIMPA 4U approach to Poland's rather busy Warsaw Airport. The Polish air safety regulator &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2020/04/02/akt.pdf&quot;&gt;published this mildly alarming finding in 2016&lt;/a&gt; [2-page PDF, in Polish].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fixed through a software update, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/15/2019-02160/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes&quot;&gt;as the US Federal Aviation Administration reiterated last year&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Warsaw's BIMPA 4U approach has since been superseded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; asked Boeing to comment. ®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bootnote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pitch and power is a simple concept. If you have the throttles, say, three-quarters open and the nose of the aeroplane is pointing a few degrees above the horizon, chances are you're probably flying straight and level at a safe speed. Training manuals normally contain a number of precise pitch and power settings (they vary between aeroplane types) so if display systems start failing, pilots can fall back to these with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon begins temperature checks and will provide surgical masks at warehouses</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-masks-e/exclusive-amazon-to-deploy-masks-and-temperature-checks-for-workers-by-next-week-idUSKBN21K1Y6</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-masks-e/exclusive-amazon-to-deploy-masks-and-temperature-checks-for-workers-by-next-week-idUSKBN21K1Y6</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AMZN.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O&quot;&gt;AMZN.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) plans to roll out temperature checks and face masks for staff at all its U.S. and European warehouses plus Whole Foods stores by early next week, a huge deployment for workers on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has reported virus cases among warehouse staff and faced several demonstrations, said it would start testing hundreds of thousands of employees a day for fevers. It told Reuters it would use no-contact forehead thermometers at site entrances and send anyone registering more than 100.4 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All locations will have surgical masks available by early next week, after millions were ordered weeks ago, according to Amazon. Particle-blocking N95 masks it has ordered will instead be donated to medical workers or sold at cost to government and healthcare organizations, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will also use machine-learning software to monitor building cameras and determine whether employees are staying at safe distances during their shifts, or whether they are often huddled too close together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans, previously unreported, show how the world’s largest online retailer is aiming to mitigate the major health risks facing its staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like first responders, workers are bringing food and essential goods to millions of people whom governments have told to stay at home. But doing so puts staff into proximity with countless others at warehouses, at grocery stores and at shoppers’ doorsteps, increasing the likelihood they will contract the COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_WMT.N_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/WMT.N&quot;&gt;WMT.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), the largest U.S. employer, said earlier this week it would take employees’ temperature and provide them with masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20200402&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1511496281&amp;amp;r=LYNXMPEG311CO&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: An Amazon package is delivered and left at the door during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in El Masnou, north to Barcelona, Spain, March 26, 2020.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said the mask rollout was underway. Temperature scans have begun at facilities near its Seattle headquarters and in New York. The company has already ramped up to more than 100,000 employee checks daily, with more sites to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers with high temperatures will have to stay home until they pass three days without a fever, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer has more than 700 facilities in its U.S. and European distribution network, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Amazon-owned Whole Foods has 508 stores, according to the grocer’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;80,000 WORKERS HIRED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some unions and elected officials have criticized Amazon’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, a pandemic that has infected more than 935,000 people globally and led to about 47,000 deaths. Some officials have called on the company to shut down its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, workers from at least 19 warehouses have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to reports, leading to walkouts by a small number of staff in New York and near Detroit this week. Delivery drivers contracted for Amazon and other companies have said they lacked hand sanitizer, sick pay and health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing a shortage of labor to address a spike in customer orders, Amazon has largely avoided warehouse closures and last month said it would hire 100,000 people. It reported a full and part-time workforce of 798,000 as of Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Slideshow &lt;span class=&quot;Slideshow_count&quot;&gt;(2 Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the company said it had filled more than 80,000 of those 100,000 positions, and now expects to spend well above the $350 million it forecast for pay raises that run through April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said the company has prioritized worker safety and changed more than 150 processes to do so. To promote social distancing, Amazon has already staggered warehouse work start times and ended stand-up meetings during shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is more important to us than making sure that we protect the health of our teams,” Clark said in a blog post on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

That's part of its value I think... likely a consequence of not trying to do as much.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.301886792453&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Very nice. I had cobbled up a &quot;one liner&quot; (sort of) gawk webserver on here a couple a months ago: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22085459&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22085459&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I tried making it scalable, but unfortunately, the server sockets in gawk don't set SO_REUSEPORT. So, I can't fork usable children. It does work if you use LD_PRELOAD tricks, or edit the gawk binary to change SO_REUSEADDR to SO_REUSEPORT, but both are pretty hacky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If gawk would separate the listen() and accept() calls out, you could do a lot more with their server socket code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I always like when classic lean-and-mean Unix tools get attention, as opposed to big language ecosystems. Speaking of which, is there a particular reason why only gawk is covered? gawk has only &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; minor enhancements to POSIX awk, and gawk isn't even the default in many place. For example, Debian uses, or used to use, mawk as default, while the BSDs and Mac OS have nawk. I think the point of awk is that it's portable, and introducing gawkisms in your program not only makes it non-portable, but also would make it impossible to run on mawk, which is much &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster for eg. log file analysis. Might not matter all that much for one-liners, though.&lt;/span&gt;

I cover only gawk, because I don't know all the differences between various versions. This started as a chapter in my command line text processing repo, where I cover various tools. I had come across various posts on stackoverflow/unix.stackexchange about implementation differences. I use Ubuntu, so I made a choice of sticking to GNU/Linux to make my life simpler.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm not sure about your point saying &quot;only very minor enhancements&quot;. When I posted about my book on reddit, I got this comment [1] noting feature differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Wait, what? Ubuntu server and macOS both have awk preinstalled (which is true for any POSIX) and gawk &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; preinstalled.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Edit: Okay, /usr/bin/awk is actually gawk on Ubuntu, so I was wrong about that. Still, macOS isn't very rare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying media servers for WebRTC has two major challenges, scaling beyond a single server as well as optimizing the media latency for all users in the conference. While simple sharding approaches like “send all users in conference X to server Y” are easy to scale horizontally, they are far from optimal in terms of the media latency which is a key factor in the user experience. Distributing a conference to a network of servers located close to the users and interconnected with each other on a reliable backbone promises a solution to both problems at the same time. Boris Grozev from the Jitsi team describes the cascading &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtchacks.com/tag/sfu/&quot;&gt;SFU&lt;/a&gt; problem in-depth and shows their approach as well as some of the challenges they ran into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time communication applications are very sensitive to network conditions such as throughput, delay, and loss. Lower bitrates lead to lower video quality and longer network latency leads to a longer end-to-end delay in audio and video. Packet loss can lead to “choppy” audio and video freezes due to video frame skipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this it is important to select an optimal path between the endpoints in a conference. When there are only two participants this is relatively straightforward – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtchacks.com/trickle-ice/&quot;&gt;ICE protocol&lt;/a&gt; is used by WebRTC to establish a connection between the two endpoints to exchange multimedia. The two endpoints connect directly if possible, and otherwise use a TURN relay server in less typical situations. WebRTC supports resolving a domain name to get the TURN server address, which makes it easy to select a local TURN server based on DNS, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-making-of-appear-in/where-to-deploy-turn-or-other-relay-servers-2dab2e8157ea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;by using AWS Route53’s routing options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when a conference has more participants routed through a centralized media server the situation is much more complex. Many WebRTC services like Hangouts, appear.in, Slack, and our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.jit.si&quot;&gt;meet.jit.si&lt;/a&gt;, use a Selective Forwarding Units (SFU) to more efficiently relay audio and video among 3 or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.3fqm9boa71sw&quot;&gt;The Star Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case all endpoints connect to a central server (in a star topology) with which they exchange multimedia. It should be obvious that selecting the location of the server has a huge impact on user experience — if all participants in the conference are located in the US, using a server in Sydney is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most services use a simple approach which works well a lot of the time — they select a server close to the first participant in the conference. However, there are some cases where this isn’t optimal. For example, suppose we have the three participants as shown in the diagram above – two are based on the East Coast of the US and the third is in Australia. If the Australian participant (Caller C) joins the conference first, this algorithm selects the server in Australia (Server 2), but Server 1 in the US is a better choice since it is closer to the majority of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenarios such as these are not common, but they do happen. Assuming the order in which participants join is random, this happens in ⅓ of conferences with 3 participants where one is in a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scenario which happens more often is illustrated in the diagram below: we have two groups of participants in two locations. In this case the order of joining doesn’t matter, we will always have some pairs of users that are close to each other, but their media has to go through a server in a remote location. For example, in the image below there are 2 Australian callers (C&amp;amp;D) and 2 US callers (A&amp;amp;B) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3081&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;pasted image 0 3&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3.png 1600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3-300x161.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3-768x413.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3-1024x550.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3-600x323.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-3-560x301.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to Server 1 is non-optimal for Callers C&amp;amp;D. Server 2 is non-optimal for callers A&amp;amp;B. Whether we use Server 1 or Server 2 there will be some participants connected through a non-optimal remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we weren’t limited to using one server? We could have every participant connected to a local server, we just have to interconnect the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.qm9t39mj1kup&quot;&gt;Solution: Cascading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postponing the question of how do we actually interconnect the servers, let’s first look at what effect this has on the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-3078&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;cascading SFU server-to-server communication illustration&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;860&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0.png 1600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-300x161.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-768x413.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-1024x550.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-600x323.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pasted-image-0-560x301.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFU connection from C to D hasn’t changed – that still goes through Server 2. For the connection between A and B we use Server 1 instead of Server 2 as in the previous diagram  which is obviously better. The interesting part is actually the connection from A to C (or any of the others, for which the effects are analogous). Instead of using A&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;Server 2&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;C we use A&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;Server 1&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;Server 2&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.h1n2s0xgdqm1&quot;&gt;Non-intuitive trip time impacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting SFU bridges like this has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, our results show that in such situations &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8301726&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ccwc2018-geo.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;he end-to-end round-trip-time is higher when we add additional hops&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, reducing the round trip time from the client to the first server that it is connected to has an advantage on its own, because we can perform stream repair with lower latency on a hop-by-hop basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that work? WebRTC uses RTP, usually over UDP, to transfer media. This means that the transport is not reliable. When a UDP packet is lost in the network, it is up to the application to either ignore/conceal the loss, or request a retransmission using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4585#section-6.2.1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RTCP NACK packet&lt;/a&gt;. For example the application might chose to ignore lost audio packets, and request retransmission for some but not all video packets (depending on whether they are required for decoding of subsequent frames or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3091&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-3091&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3091&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1476&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission.png 1476w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission-300x89.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission-768x228.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission-1024x305.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission-600x178.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/single-server-RTP-packet-retransmission-560x167.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3091&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;RTP packet rentransmission with a single server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cascaded bridges, these retransmissions can be limited to a local server. For example, in the A-S1-S2-C path, if a packet is lost between A and S1, S1 will notice and request retransmission. If a packet is lost between S2 and C, C will request retransmission and S2 will respond from its cache. And if a packet is lost between two servers, the receiving server can request a retransmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3092&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-3092&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3092&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1476&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers.png 1476w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers-300x96.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers-768x246.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers-1024x327.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers-600x192.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RTP-retransmission-with-2-servers-560x179.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3092&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;RTP packet retransmission with two servers. Note that Server 2 does not retransmit packet 2, because the NACK arrives soon after the packet was sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients use a jitter buffer to delay the playback of video, in order to allow for delayed or retransmitted packets to arrive. The size of this buffer changes dynamically based in part on the round-trip time. When retransmissions are performed hop-by-hop, the latency is lower, and therefore the jitter buffer can be shorter, leading to lower overall delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, even though the end-to-end round-trip-time is higher with an extra server, this could lead to lower end-to-end media delay (but we have yet to explore this effect in practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.hpmyj6fyuozf&quot;&gt;Implementing a Cascading SFU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we implement this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;, and how do we deploy it on meet.jit.si?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.hnnstyoggkm&quot;&gt;Signaling vs. Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at signaling first. Since its inception, Jitsi Meet has separated the concept of a signaling server (which is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jicofo&lt;/a&gt;) and a media server/SFU (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;jitsi-videobridge&lt;/a&gt;). This separation allowed us to implement support for cascaded bridges relatively easily. For one thing, we could just keep all the signaling logic in a central place — Jicofo. Second, we already had the protocol for signaling between Jicofo and Jitsi Videobridge (&lt;a href=&quot;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0340.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;COLIBRI&lt;/a&gt;). We only had to add a small extension to it. We already had support for multiple SFUs connected to one signaling server (for load balancing). Now we had to add the option for one SFU to connect to multiple signaling servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up with two independent pools of servers — one pool of jicofo instances and one pool of jitsi-videobridge instances. The diagram below illustrates part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3085&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-3085&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3085 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;cascading SFU server-to-server architecture on AWS illustration&quot; width=&quot;2856&quot; height=&quot;1834&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture.png 2856w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture-300x193.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture-768x493.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture-1024x658.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture-600x385.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jitsi-meet-architecture-560x360.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2856px) 100vw, 2856px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3085&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Example of the Jitsi Meet Setup on AWS allowing bridge cascading across different data centers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of our system is the bridge-to-bridge communication. We wanted to keep this part as simple as possible, and therefore we decided to not do any explicit signaling between the bridges. All signaling happens between jicofo and jitsi-videobridge, and the connection between two bridges is only used for audio/video and data channel messages coming from clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.c7bywr9l6yd5&quot;&gt;The Octo protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To coordinate this communication we came up with the Octo protocol, which wraps RTP packets in a simple fixed-length header, and allows to transport string messages. In the current implementation, the bridges are connected to each other in a full mesh, but the design allows for other topologies as well. For example, using a central relay server (a star of bridges), or a tree structure for each bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnote: Note that instead of prepending the Octo header it could be added as an RTP header extension, making the streams between bridges pure (S)RTP. Future versions of Octo might use this approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second footnote: Octo doesn’t really stand for anything.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;We were initially planning to use a central relay, and for some reason it reminded us of an octopus, so we kept that name for the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Jitsi Videobridge terminology, when a bridge is part of a multi-bridge conference, it has a an additional Octo channel (actually one channel for audio and one for video). This channel is responsible for forwarding the media to all other bridges, as well as receiving media from all other bridges. Each bridge binds to a single port for Octo (4096 by default), which is why we need the conference ID field to be able to handle multiple conferences at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the protocol does not have its own security mechanism and we delegate that responsibility to lower layers. This is something that we want to work on next, but for the time being the bridges need to be in a secure network (we use a separate AWS VPC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.88cjlqai9mk6&quot;&gt;Use with Simulcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing features of Jitsi Meet is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtchacks.com/sfu-simulcast/&quot;&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt; where each participant sends multiple streams of different bitrates and the bridge helps select the ones that are needed. We wanted to make sure that this continues to work robustly, so we forward all of the simulcast streams between the bridges. This allows for quicker switching between streams (because the local bridge doesn’t have to request a new stream). However, it is not optimal in terms of bridge-to-bridge traffic, because some of the streams are often not used and just consume exra bandwidth for no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.fa2dwox9w8jg&quot;&gt;Active Speaker Selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to continue to support following the active speaker in a conference (giving them the most real estate). This turned out to be easy — we just have each bridge do the dominant speaker identification independently, and notify its local clients (this is also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2SVegc0NNk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;approach others have used&lt;/a&gt;). This means that the calculation is done multiple times, but it is not expensive, and allows us to simplify things (e.g. we don’t have to decide which bridge does DSI, and worry about routing the messages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.v54yp8b868xh&quot;&gt;Bridge Selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the current implementation, the bridge selection algorithm is simple. When a new participant joins, Jicofo needs to decide which bridge to allocate to it. It does so based on the region of the client and the regions and load of the bridges available to it. If there is an available bridge in the same region as the client, it’s used. Otherwise, one of the existing conference bridges is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For documentation about setting up Octo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/octo.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.nwp2b7xeje6b&quot;&gt;Deploying Cascading SFU’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now enabled geographical bridge cascading, as described above, on meet.jit.si.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this deployment we run all machines in Amazon AWS. We have servers (both signaling and media) in six regions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;us-east-1 (N. Virginia),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;us-west-2 (Oregon),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eu-west-1 (Ireland),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eu-central-1 (Frankfurt),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ap-se-1 (Singapore) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ap-se-2 (Sydney).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a layer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.org/news/new-tutorial-video-scaling-jitsi-meet-in-the-cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;geolocated HAProxy instances&lt;/a&gt; which help to determine which region a client is coming from. The meet.jit.si domain is managed by Route53 and resolves to an HAProxy instance, which adds its own region to the HTTP headers of the request it forwards. This header is then used to set the value of the &lt;span id=&quot;crayon-5e8688c4a9003346653845&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-syntax-inline crayon-theme-vs2012 crayon-theme-vs2012-inline crayon-font-monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-pre crayon-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;deploymentInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;userRegion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  variable made available to the client via the &lt;span id=&quot;crayon-5e8688c4a9012696168529&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-syntax-inline crayon-theme-vs2012 crayon-theme-vs2012-inline crayon-font-monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-pre crayon-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For diagnostics and to demonstrate this feature, the user interface on meet.jit.si shows how many bridges are in use, and where each participant is connected to. Scrolling over the top left part of your local thumbnail shows you the number of servers and the region of the server you are connected to. Scrolling over a remote thumbnail shows you the region of the server the remote participant is connected to, and the end-to-end round trip time between your browser and theirs (as E2E RTT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3077&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-3077&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3077&quot; src=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated.png&quot; alt=&quot;octo annotated&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;814&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated.png 1600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated-300x153.png 300w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated-768x391.png 768w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated-1024x521.png 1024w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated-600x305.png 600w, https://ltwus2ix28x10gixx34jeigv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/octo-annotated-560x285.png 560w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3077&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;You can see if bridge cascading is in use by checking where everyone is connected in Jitsi Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.z6luf9nhtv5k&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially launched Octo as an A/B test on meet.jit.si in August. The initial results looked good and it is now enabled for everyone. We have a lot of data to go through and we are planning to look at how well Octo performs in detail and write more about it. We are also planning to use this work as the first stepping stone towards supporting larger conferences (for which a single SFU is not sufficient). So stay tuned for more about this in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, you can drop us a message on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jitsi.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;community forums&lt;/a&gt;, or join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.org/thecall/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bi-weekly community conference call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Physics Travel Guide – Physics concepts explained in three levels of difficulty</title>
<link>https://physicstravelguide.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://physicstravelguide.com</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;32.375278396437&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit6&quot; id=&quot;what_is_the_physics_travel_guide&quot;&gt;What is the Physics Travel Guide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/_media/map.png&quot; class=&quot;mediaright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an expository physics wiki, but also much more than that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.4672131147541&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every page emphasizes why the given topic is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We publish for any given topic &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; explanations with increasing levels of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the concepts, we collect concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect reading recommendations and answers to frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1.3421052631579&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;li&quot; readability=&quot;7.1578947368421&quot;&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/resources&quot; class=&quot;wikilink1&quot; title=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt;, that give concrete advice on how to learn a given topic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit7&quot; id=&quot;great_explanations_in_the_spotlight&quot;&gt;Great Explanations in the Spotlight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/_media/idealight.png&quot; class=&quot;mediaright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There already exist great explanations for almost any topic. However, currently, they are often incredibly hard to find and hidden in old textbooks or in papers buried somewhere on the arXiv. Our goal is that great explanations get the attention they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to, for example, Wikipedia we do not simply refer the readers to the most rigorous textbook and the original paper, i.e. the &quot;standard references&quot;. Instead, we want to collect those resources that are the most helpful for students. We want to help learners to discover the best resources for each stage during their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit8&quot; id=&quot;made_for_self-directed_learning&quot;&gt;Made for Self-Directed Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/_media/helpinghand.png&quot; class=&quot;mediaright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Physics Travel Guide tries to fill a gap because textbooks and lectures usually don't acknowledge that there is a difference between pedagogy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy&quot; class=&quot;urlextern&quot; title=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;andragogy&lt;/a&gt;. Textbooks and lectures explain things linearly and try to be pedagogical. &quot;Pedagogy&quot; is a synthesis of the two Greek words &quot;paidos&quot; (child) and &quot;ágō&quot; (to lead) and literally means &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy&quot; class=&quot;urlextern&quot; title=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;to lead a child&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, &quot;andragogy&quot; means literally &quot;to lead a man&quot; and is the study of methods and principles to teach adults. It's clear that you can't teach children and adults in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Physics Travel Guide has the needs of adults in mind, is non-linear and ideally suited for self-directed learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;14.569278996865&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit11&quot; id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following pages give an idea how this works in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit12&quot; id=&quot;who_is_it_for&quot;&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/_media/family.png&quot; class=&quot;mediaright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Physics Travel Guide exists to lower the entry barrier to technical topics for laymen, students and researchers alike. Specifically, it's a tool for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who prefer to learn at their own pace and want to know more than is taught in the lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lecturers and teachers who search for inspiration of how to explain things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers who want to learn new topics more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested laypersons who search for explanations that everyone can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an overview of the topics which are currently included have a look at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/toc&quot; class=&quot;wikilink1&quot; title=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionedit13&quot; id=&quot;everyone_can_participate&quot;&gt;Everyone can Participate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://physicstravelguide.com/_media/icons8-crowdfunding-80_1_.png&quot; class=&quot;mediaright&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Physics Travel Guide is currently not complete and never will be. However, everyone can help to make the current gaps smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner and find an explanation that finally makes it click for you, simply add a reference to it on the corresponding page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an idea how something could be explained better, write it down. Your explanation helps hundreds of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;level1&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts can always help to make things more rigorous and clearer in the abstract section of each page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latest changes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
