<title>1:60 scale Boeing 777 made from manila folders</title>
<link>https://www.lucaiaconistewart.com/model-777</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lucaiaconistewart.com/model-777</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This project traces its beginnings to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucaiaconistewart.com/architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;architecture class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in high school where we learned to use manila file folders to roughly model our building ideas. The more I worked with paper, the more I fell in love with its versatility. At some point, I got the idea to make a model of an airplane as a way of challenging myself with an unconventional shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though the project began on a much smaller and simpler scale in mid-2008, it has since evolved through multiple revisions to become a highly detailed, true-to-life representation of a Boeing 777. I originally drew my plans by hand, but my desire to increase the accuracy and amount of detail led me to start using Adobe Illustrator to design and print increasingly intricate parts directly onto the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The project has been in progress since May 2008&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Decision for 2020-21 Academic Year</title>
<link>https://www.fas.harvard.edu/fas-decision-2020-2021-academic-year</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Because COVID-19 is highly contagious, an individual's actions can have serious implications for the health of the broader community. Though an undergraduate student may be at relatively low risk of complications associated with COVID-19, for example, their actions can impact the families of dining workers, security guards, House staff and others who make residential life possible. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences promotes shared responsibility for the health and well-being of our campus community. We are truly in this together. &lt;strong&gt;It is important that all students who will reside on campus in Fall 2020 read, understand, and be prepared to abide by the rules and guidelines that will be in place in the fall in order to make an informed decision about residency&lt;/strong&gt;. Those guidelines, as developed by Harvard University Health Services, will include, among other features, the requirement that students and residential staff participate in a viral testing program that will begin with an initial screening upon arrival, followed by testing for the virus every three days while in residence. The frequency of testing may increase or decrease depending on the prevalence of infection within the Harvard community and the region, along with other factors influencing the likelihood of exposure to the virus.  Additional testing may be warranted if a student or residential staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19.The campus public health protocols will also include daily attestations of symptoms, requirements to self-isolate  in the event of a positive test, to speak with a health care professional if experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or to quarantine for known exposure to a positive case. We have established dedicated housing for quarantine and isolation, with sufficient space to appropriately house 250 individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations of students in residence are outlined in the undergraduate Social Compact available &lt;a href=&quot;https://dso.college.harvard.edu/files/dso/files/community_compact-6_5_20.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Playstation&amp;#039;s secret weapon: a nearly all-automated factory</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/PlayStation-s-secret-weapon-a-nearly-all-automated-factory</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/PlayStation-s-secret-weapon-a-nearly-all-automated-factory</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TOKYO -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Sony-Corp&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;'s PlayStation has won hundreds of millions of fans across the world since its launch in 1994. But few know just how much of the console's success can be attributed to an unassuming factory located just across the bay from Tokyo. (Click here for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vdata.nikkei.com/en/newsgraphics/sony-playstation/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;graphic-rich version&lt;/a&gt; of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Kisarazu, a large, white building towers over an otherwise suburban landscape. Once inside, visitors are greeted by the whirring of motors as dozens of robots seamlessly churn out PlayStation 4 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few humans were present to deal with a handful of tasks -- two to feed bare motherboards to the line, and two to package the finished consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the actual assembly is done entirely by articulated robots, supplied by &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Mitsubishi-Electric-Corp&quot;&gt;Mitsubishi Electric&lt;/a&gt;. The 31.4-meter line, completed in 2018, has the ability to churn out a new console every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kisarazu plant is operated by Sony Global Manufacturing &amp;amp; Operations, or SGMO, the group's manufacturing arm. The unit has worked with video game unit Sony Interactive Entertainment to bring cutting-edge technologies to the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;align-center ez-embed-type-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__image article__image--lightbox article__image--inline&quot; data-trackable=&quot;image-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;img full=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F8%2F9%2F5%2F3%2F28033598-1-eng-GB%2FOGimage%20%282%29.jpg?source=nar-cms&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid js-lightbox-magnify lightbox__magnify&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F_aliases%2Farticleimage%2F8%2F9%2F5%2F3%2F28033598-1-eng-GB%2FOGimage%20%282%29.jpg?source=nar-cms&quot; onerror=&quot;this.src = '/bundles/app/images/placeholder.jpg?d530'; this.alt = '(placeholder image)'&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the plant's crowning achievements is the use of robots to attach wires, tape and other flexible parts to the consoles. Twenty-six out of 32 robots at the Kisarazu plant are dedicated to the task, deftly handling materials most robots would find too finicky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, attaching the flexible flat cable -- a tape-like electrical cord -- requires one robot arm to hold up the cable and another to twist it. The cable then needs to be attached in a specific direction using just the right pressure, which may seem simple for a human but is an extremely complex maneuver for robot.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kento Awashima)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's probably no other site that can manipulate robots in this manner,&quot; said an engineer. Every process -- all the way to final packaging -- is automated. The blend of robotic and human labor is painstakingly optimized with a priority on return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I created profitable production lines,&quot; said Hiroyuki Kusakabe, general architect at SGMO.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kento Awashima) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on productivity traces its DNA back to the original PlayStation that came out in Japan in December 1994. Teiyu Goto, the designer of the original console, concentrated on crafting a gaming system that lends itself easily to mass production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goto reportedly pushed the engineers at the Kisarazu site to improve productivity. The refined production tech was then transferred to contract manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kento Awashima)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a console nears the end of its marketable life, the model will inevitably fall victim to declining sales and price competition. Production lines are able to maintain profitability thanks to constant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PlayStation 4, released in November 2013, has sold over 100 million units during its lifespan. Paid network service subscribers span 41.5 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kento Awashima)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 trillion yen ($93 billion) in sales and 1 trillion yen in profits generated by the PS4 underpinned the structural reforms introduced by Kazuo Hirai, who served as president and CEO from 2012 to 2018. The console now forms the center of the new Sony, along with film, music and other content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer Ken Kutaragi, dubbed the father of the PlayStation, championed the device despite pushback from other executives. Twenty-five years later, the series has become the poster child for Sony craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no guarantee of future success. Although the PS2 was a hit when it was released in 2000, when the PS3 came out in 2006, it gave up market share to the Microsoft Xbox. Unlike in the past, the next decade at Sony Group will depend on how well the PS5 is received when it is expected to hit shelves this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC)</title>
<link>https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1</guid>
<description>Today, compressed video data make up 80% of global Internet traffic. H.266/VVC represents the pinnacle of (at least) four generations of international standards for video coding. The previous standards H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and H.265/HEVC, which were produced with substantial contributions from Fraunhofer HHI, remain active in more than 10 billion end devices, processing over 90% of the total global volume of video bits. Both previous standards were also recognized by collectively three Emmy Engineering Awards for contributing substantially to the progress of television technology.&lt;p&gt;Through a reduction of data requirements, H.266/VVC makes video transmission in mobile networks (where data capacity is limited) more efficient. For instance, the previous standard H.265/HEVC requires ca. 10 gigabytes of data to transmit a 90-min UHD video. With this new technology, only 5 gigabytes of data are required to achieve the same quality. Because H.266/VVC was developed with ultra-high-resolution video content in mind, the new standard is particularly beneficial when streaming 4K or 8K videos on a flat screen TV. Furthermore, H.266/VVC is ideal for all types of moving images: from high-resolution 360° video panoramas to screen sharing contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After dedicating almost three years toward this standard, we are proud to have been instrumental in developing H.266/VVC,&quot; says Benjamin Bross, head of the Video Coding Systems group at Fraunhofer HHI and editor of the +500-page standard specification of H.266/VVC. “Because of the quantum leap in coding efficiency offered by H.266/VVC, the use of video will increase further worldwide. Moreover, the increased versatility of H.266/VVC makes its use more attractive for a broader range of applications related to the transmission and storage of video.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you consider that Fraunhofer HHI already played a key role in the development of the previous video coding standards H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC, then we are happy with the fact that more than 50% of the bits on the Internet are generated by a Fraunhofer HHI technology,” adds Dr. Detlev Marpe, head of the Video Coding and Analytics department at Fraunhofer HHI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded. In addition to Fraunhofer Society, the MC-IF now includes +30 companies and organizations. The new chips required for the use of H.266/VVC, such as those in mobile devices, are currently being designed. Dr. Thomas Schierl, head of the Video Coding and Analytics department at Fraunhofer HHI, announced “this autumn Fraunhofer HHI will publish the first software (for both encoder and decoder) to support H.266/VVC.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Around 293 intermediate CAs in violation of CA/Browser guidelines</title>
<link>https://www.mail-archive.com/dev-security-policy@lists.mozilla.org/msg13493.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mail-archive.com/dev-security-policy@lists.mozilla.org/msg13493.html</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
I've created a new batch of certificates that violate 4.9.9 of the BRs,
which was introduced with the first version of the Baseline Requirements as
a MUST. This is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://misissued.com/batch/138/&quot;&gt;https://misissued.com/batch/138/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

A quick inspection among the affected CAs include O fields of: QuoVadis,
GlobalSign, Digicert, HARICA, Certinomis, AS Sertifitseeimiskeskus,
Actalis, Atos, AC Camerfirma, SECOM, T-Systems, WISeKey, SCEE, and CNNIC.

Section 4.9.9 of the BRs requires that OCSP Delegated Responders MUST
include an id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension. RFC 6960 defines an OCSP
Delegated Responder within Section 4.2.2.2 as indicated by the presence of
the id-kp-OCSPSigning as an EKU.

These certificates lack the necessary extension, and as such, violate the
BRs. As the vast majority of these were issued on-or-after 2013-02-01, the
Effective Date of Mozilla Root CA Policy v2.1, these are misissued. You
could also consider the effective date as 2013-05-15, described later in
[1] , without changing the results.

This batch is NOT comprehensive. According to crt.sh, there are
approximately 293 certificates that meet the criteria of &quot;issued by a
Mozilla-trusted, TLS-capable CA, with the OCSPSigning EKU, and without
pkix-nocheck&quot;. misissued.com had some issues with parsing some of these
certificates, due to other non-conformities, so I only included a sample.

Censys.io is aware of approximately 276 certificates that meet this
criteria, as you can see at [2]. The differences in perspectives
underscores the importance of CAs needing to carefully examine the
certificates they've issued to understand.

It's important for CAs to understand this is Security Relevant. While they
should proceed with revoking these CAs within seven (7) days, as defined
under the Baseline Requirements Section 4.9.1.2, the degree of this issue
likely also justifies requiring witnessed Key Destruction Reports, in order
to preserve the integrity of the issuer of these certificates (which may
include the CA's root).

The reason for this is simple: In every case I examined, these are
certificates that appear to nominally be intended as Issuing CAs, not as
OCSP Responder Certificates. It would appear that many CAs were unfamiliar
with RFC 6960 when constructing their certificate profiles, and similarly
ignored discussion of this issue in the past [3], which highlighted the
security impact of this. I've flagged this as a SECURITY matter for CAs to
carefully review, because in the cases where a third-party, other than the
Issuing CA, operates such a certificate, the Issuing CA has delegated the
ability to mint arbitrary OCSP responses to this third-party!

For example, consider a certificate like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?id=2657658699&quot;&gt;https://crt.sh/?id=2657658699&lt;/a&gt; .
This certificate, from HARICA, meets Mozilla's definition of &quot;Technically
Constrained&quot; for TLS, in that it lacks the id-kp-serverAuth EKU. However,
because it includes the OCSP Signing EKU, this certificate can be used to
sign arbitrary OCSP messages for HARICA's Root!

This also applies to non-technically-constrained sub-CAs. For example,
consider this certificate &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?id=21606064&quot;&gt;https://crt.sh/?id=21606064&lt;/a&gt; . It was issued by
DigiCert to Microsoft, granting Microsoft the ability to provide OCSP
responses for any certificate issued by Digicert's Baltimore CyberTrust
Root. We know from DigiCert's disclosures that this is independently
operated by Microsoft.

Unfortunately, revocation of this certificate is simply not enough to
protect Mozilla TLS users. This is because this Sub-CA COULD provide OCSP
for itself that would successfully validate, AND provide OCSP for other
revoked sub-CAs, even if it was revoked. That is, if this Sub-CA's key was
maliciously used to sign a GOOD response for itself, it would be accepted.
These security concerns are discussed in Section 4.2.2.2.1 of RFC 6960, and
is tied to a reliance on the CRL. Mozilla users COULD be protected through
the use of OneCRL, although this would not protect other PKI participants
or use cases that don't use OneCRL.

A little more than a third of the affected certificates have already been
revoked, which is encouraging. However, I'm not aware of any incident
reports discussing this failure, nor am I aware of any key destruction
reports to provide assurance that these keys cannot be used maliciously.
While this seems like a benign failure of &quot;we used the wrong profile&quot;, it
has a meaningful security impact to end users, even if it was made with the
best of intentions.

This has been a requirement of the BRs since the first version, and is
spelled out within the OCSP RFCs, and CAs are expected to be deeply
knowledgeable in both of these areas. There is no excusing such an
oversight, especially if it was (most likely) to work around an issue with
a particular CA Software Vendor's product. Recall that the same
justification (work around an issue in a vendor's product) has been used to
justify MITM interception. Ignorance and malice are, unfortunately, often
indistinguishable, and thus have to be treated the same.

While I'll be looking to create Compliance Incidents for the affected CAs,
and attempting to report through their problem reporting mechanisms, the
fact that it is the constrained CAs which are not yet required to be
disclosed, and most likely invisible to CT (e.g. S/MIME issuing CAs that do
not issue TLS), still pose substantial risk, that it requires every CA
closely examine their practices.

CAs affected MUST ensure they revoke such certificates within 7 days, as
per 4.9.1.2 (5) and 4.9.1.2 (6)

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Technology firm Fujitsu has said it will halve its office space in Japan as it adapts to the &quot;new normal&quot; of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says the &quot;Work Life Shift&quot; programme will offer unprecedented flexibility to its 80,000 workers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff will be able to work flexible hours, and working from home will be standard wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement follows a similar move in May by social media platform Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/0706-01.html&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;a statement sent to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Fujitsu said it &quot;will introduce a new way of working that promises a more empowering, productive, and creative experience for employees that will boost innovation and deliver new value to its customers and society&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan employees will &quot;begin to primarily work on a remote basis to achieve a working style that allows them to flexibly use their time according to the contents of their work, business roles, and lifestyle&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said the programme would allow staff to choose where they worked, whether that was from home, a major corporate hub or a satellite office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu believes that that the increased autonomy offered to its workers will help to improve the performance of teams and increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sree Sreenivasan, visiting professor of digital innovation at the Stony Brook University School of Journalism, said the announcement underlined the huge long-term impact of the pandemic on the way many of us work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is yet another sign that everything we know about offices and the future of work is being upended. Thousands of employers and millions of employees are learning the pros and cons of the new normal.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If they can combine the best of the pros (less commuting, more productivity, less expenses, etc), while minimising the cons (lack of in-person bonding, never being off the clock, etc), millions will be grateful, while frustrating thousands who preferred the old way of life,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52628119&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Twitter allows staff to work from home 'forever'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Twitter told staff that they could work from home &quot;forever&quot; if they wished, as the company looks towards the future after the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media platform said: &quot;The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier that month Google and Facebook said their staff could work from home until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google originally said it would keep its work from home policy until 1 June, but extended it for seven more months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its announcement coincided with a similar move by social media giant Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brython – A Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming</title>
<link>https://brython.info/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brython.info/</guid>
<description>&lt;td readability=&quot;21.536144578313&quot;&gt;Sem dúvida você já viu um relógio como este em demonstrações de HTML5
&lt;p&gt;Entretanto, clique com o botão direito e veja o código fonte desta págna...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não é código em Javascript! Em vez disso, você encontrará código em Python em um script do tipo &quot;text/python&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brython foi desenhado para substituir o Javascript como a linguagem de script da Web. Como tal, é uma implementação de Python 3 (você pode testar no &lt;a href=&quot;https://brython.info/console.html&quot; id=&quot;c_pt&quot;&gt;console&lt;/a&gt;), adaptada ao ambiente HTML5, quer dizer, com uma interface para objetos e eventos DOM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://brython.info/gallery/gallery_pt.html&quot;&gt;galeria&lt;/a&gt; apresenta algumas possibilidades, da criaçao de simples elementos de documentos até a ação de arrastar e soltar e navegação em 3D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desculpe, Brython não consegue fazer a demonstração funcionar em seu navegador,&lt;br/&gt;verifique se o Javascript está ligado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

<title>Ennio Morricone has died</title>
<link>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ennio-morricone-dead-prolific-italian-composer-was-91-858358</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ennio-morricone-dead-prolific-italian-composer-was-91-858358</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__deck&quot;&gt;Renowned for scoring Sergio Leone’s spaghetti Westerns, the Oscar winner also produced the sounds and music for 'Days of Heaven,' 'The Mission,' 'Cinema Paradiso' and 'The Hateful Eight.'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ennio Morricone, the Oscar winner whose haunting, inventive scores expertly accentuated the simmering, dialogue-free tension of the spaghetti Westerns directed by Sergio Leone, has died. He was 91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian composer, who scored more than 500 films — seven for his countryman Leone after they had met as kids in elementary school — died Monday in Rome following complications from a fall last week in which he broke his femur.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native and lifelong resident of the Eternal City whose first instrument was the trumpet, Morricone won his Oscar for his work on Quentin Tarantino’s &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt; (2015) and also was nominated for his original scores for Terrence Malick’s &lt;em&gt;Days of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; (1978), Roland Joffe’s &lt;em&gt;The Mission&lt;/em&gt; (1986), Brian De Palma’s &lt;em&gt;The Untouchables&lt;/em&gt; (1987), Barry Levinson’s &lt;em&gt;Bugsy&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and Giuseppe Tornatore’s &lt;em&gt;Malena&lt;/em&gt; (2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known as “The Maestro,” he also received an honorary Oscar in 2007 (presented by Clint Eastwood) for his “magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music,” and he collected 11 David di Donatello Awards, Italy’s highest film honors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morricone’s ripe, pulsating sounds enriched Leone’s low-budget shoot-’em-ups &lt;em&gt;A Fistful of Dollars&lt;/em&gt; (1964), &lt;em&gt;For a Few Dollars More&lt;/em&gt; (1965), &lt;em&gt;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&lt;/em&gt; (1966) — those three starred Eastwood — &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in the West&lt;/em&gt; (1968) and &lt;em&gt;Duck, You Sucker&lt;/em&gt; (1971).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The music is indispensable, because my films could practically be silent movies, the dialogue counts for relatively little, and so the music underlines actions and feelings more than the dialogue,” Leone, who died in 1989, once said. “I’ve had him write the music before shooting, really as a part of the screenplay itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morricone’s spare focus on one instrument — like the trumpet solo in &lt;em&gt;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&lt;/em&gt;, or the oboe, which soared over a lushly reverent backdrop in &lt;em&gt;The Mission&lt;/em&gt; — enriched his contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composer loved the sound of the electric guitar and the Jew’s harp and employed whistles, church bells, whips, coyote howls, chirping birds, ticking clocks, gunshots and women’s voices to add textures to scores not associated with the typical studio arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All kinds of sounds can be useful to convey emotion … it’s music made up of the sound of reality,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morricone also teamed with Leone one last time on the Prohibition-era tale &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in America&lt;/em&gt; (1984) and partnered about a dozen times with Tornatore, including on &lt;em&gt;Cinema Paradiso&lt;/em&gt; (1988), winner of the Oscar for best foreign-language film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not like the term “spaghetti Western” and noted that his work in that genre represented just a fraction of his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is obvious, as his brilliant body of work includes collaborations with other notable directors like Gillo Pontecorvo (1966’s &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Algiers&lt;/em&gt;), Don Siegel (1970’s &lt;em&gt;Two Mules for Sister Sara&lt;/em&gt;), Bernardo Bertolucci (1976’s &lt;em&gt;1900&lt;/em&gt;), John Boorman (1977’s &lt;em&gt;Exorcist II: The Heretic&lt;/em&gt;), Edouard Molinaro (1978’s &lt;em&gt;La Cage aux Folles&lt;/em&gt;), John Carpenter (1982’s &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;), William Friedkin (1987’s &lt;em&gt;Rampage&lt;/em&gt;), Brian De Palma (1987’s &lt;em&gt;The Untouchables&lt;/em&gt;), Pedro Almodovar (1989’s &lt;em&gt;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&lt;/em&gt;), Franco Zeffirelli (1990’s &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;), Wolfgang Petersen (1993’s &lt;em&gt;In the Line of Fire&lt;/em&gt;), Mike Nichols (1994’s &lt;em&gt;Wolf&lt;/em&gt;) and Warren Beatty (1998’s &lt;em&gt;Bulworth&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was asked but never scored a film for Eastwood the director, a decision he said he regretted, and missed out on a chance to do Stanley Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/em&gt; (1971) when Leone insisted that the composer was too busy finishing up one of his films (he wasn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His theme “Chi Mai” for the 1981 BBC drama &lt;em&gt;The Life and Times of David Lloyd George&lt;/em&gt; became an international hit, and he received a Grammy for his &lt;em&gt;Untouchables&lt;/em&gt; score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarantino, a big fan, used some of his compositions for the &lt;em&gt;Kill Bill&lt;/em&gt; films, &lt;em&gt;Django Unchained&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inglourious Basterds&lt;/em&gt;. In a January 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/17/ennio-morricone-hateful-eight-oscar-nomination-interview-60-years-of-music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, Morricone said working with the director on &lt;em&gt;Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt; was “perfect ... because he gave me no cues, no guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wrote the score without Quentin Tarantino knowing anything about it, then he came to Prague when I recorded it and was very pleased. So the collaboration was based on trust and a great freedom for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2018, he came out as highly critical of Tarantino and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in an interview that was published in the German edition of &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, but Morricone denied making the disparaging remarks and threatened to sue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ennio Morricone was born on Nov. 10, 1928, in a residential area of Rome. His father, Mario, was a trumpet player, and the trumpet was the first instrument the youngster played. He began writing music at age 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was about 8, Morricone first met Leone in elementary school (the two would not connect again for more than two decades). He attended the Santa Cecilia Conservatory, where he studied under Goffredo Petrassi, a major Italian composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morricone composed music for radio dramas and played in an orchestra that specialized in music written for films. “Most of these scores were very ugly, and I believed I could do better,” he said in a 2001 interview. “After the war, the film industry was quite strong here in Italy … but these new realistic movies didn’t have great music. I needed money, and I thought it would be a good thing to write film scores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked with Mario Lanza, Paul Anka, Charles Aznavour, Chet Baker and others as a studio arranger at RCA and with director Luciano Salce on a number of plays. When Salce needed a composer for his 1961 movie &lt;em&gt;Il Federale&lt;/em&gt;, he hired Morricone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a dozen other films followed, and Leone, doing his first Western, put Morricone to work on &lt;em&gt;Fistful of Dollars.&lt;/em&gt; (The director and composer were billed as Bob Robertson and Dan Savio, respectively, in a bid to convince Italian moviegoers, who were growing weary of homegrown Westerns, that the film was a product of Hollywood.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gradually over time, he as a director and me as a composer, we improved and reached our best, in my opinion, in &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in America&lt;/em&gt;,” Morricone said.&lt;/p&gt;
