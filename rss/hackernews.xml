<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-02-16T00:00:00+00:00&quot; class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;16 Feb 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; We present seven myths commonly believed to be true in machine learning research, circa Feb 2019. Also available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06789.pdf&quot;&gt;ArXiv&lt;/a&gt; in pdf form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-1&quot;&gt;Myth 1:&lt;/a&gt; TensorFlow is a Tensor manipulation library&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-2&quot;&gt;Myth 2:&lt;/a&gt; Image datasets are representative of real images found in the wild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-3&quot;&gt;Myth 3:&lt;/a&gt; Machine Learning researchers do not use the test set for validation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-4&quot;&gt;Myth 4:&lt;/a&gt; Every datapoint is used in training a neural network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-5&quot;&gt;Myth 5:&lt;/a&gt; We need (batch) normalization to train very deep residual networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-6&quot;&gt;Myth 6:&lt;/a&gt; Attention &amp;gt; Convolution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/2019/02/16/seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/#myth-7&quot;&gt;Myth 7:&lt;/a&gt; Saliency maps are robust ways to interpret neural networks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-1-tensorflow-is-a-tensor-manipulation-library&quot;&gt;Myth 1: TensorFlow is a Tensor manipulation library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is actually a &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; manipulation library, and this difference is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7540-computing-higher-order-derivatives-of-matrix-and-tensor-expressions.pdf&quot;&gt;Computing Higher Order Derivatives of Matrix and Tensor Expressions. Laue et al. NeurIPS 2018.&lt;/a&gt;, the authors demonstrate that their automatic differentiation library based on actual Tensor Calculus has significantly more compact expression trees. This is because Tensor Calculus uses index notation, which results in treating both the forward mode and the reverse mode in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Matrix Calculus hides the indices for notational convenience, and this often results in overly complicated automatic differentiation expression trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the matrix multiplication . We have  for the forward mode and  for the reverse mode. To perform the multiplications correctly, we have to be careful about the order of multiplication and the use of transposes. Notationally, this is a point of confusion for the machine learning practitioner, but computationally, this is an overhead for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example, which is decidedly less trivial: . We have  for the forward mode, and  for the reverse mode. In this case, it is clearly not possible to use the same expression tree for both modes, given that they are composed of different operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the way TensorFlow and other libraries (e.g. Mathematica, Maple, Sage, SimPy, ADOL-C, TAPENADE, TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, HIPS autograd) implement automatic differentiation results in different and inefficient expression trees for the forward and reverse mode. Tensor calculus conveniently avoids these problems by having commutativity in multiplication as a result of its index notation. (Please read the actual paper to learn more about how this works.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors tested their method of doing reverse-mode automatic differentiation, aka backpropagation, on three different problems and measured the amount of time it took to compute the Hessians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_1_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem involves optimizing a quadratic function like . The second problem solves for logistic regression, while the third problem solves for matrix factorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the CPU, their method was faster than popular automatic differentiation libraries like TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, and HIPS autograd by &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_1_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the GPU, they observed an even greater speedup, outperforming these libraries by a factor of &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;implication&quot;&gt;Implication:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing derivatives for quadratic or higher functions with current deep learning libraries is more expensive than it needs to be. This includes computing general fourth order tensors like the Hessian (e.g. in MAML and second-order Newton optimization). Fortunately, quadratic functions are not common in “deep learning.” But they are common in “classical” machine learning - dual of an SVM, least squares regression, LASSO, Gaussian Processes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-2-image-datasets-are-representative-of-real-images-found-in-the-wild&quot;&gt;Myth 2: Image datasets are representative of real images found in the wild&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to think that neural networks are now better than humans at the task of object recognition. This is not true. They might outperform humans on select image datasets like ImageNet, but given actual images found in the wild, they are most definitely not going to be better than a regular adult human at recognizing objects. This is because images found in current image datasets are not actually drawn from the same distribution as the set of all possible images naturally occurring in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an old paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5995347&quot;&gt;Unbiased Look at Dataset Bias. Torralba and Efros. CVPR 2011.&lt;/a&gt;, the authors proposed to examine dataset bias in twelve popular image datasets by observing if it is possible to train a classifier to identify the dataset a given image is selected from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_2_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of getting it right by random is , while their lab members performed at .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_2_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They trained an SVM on HOG features, and found that their classifier performed at , way above chance. If the same experiment was repeated today with a state of the art CNN, we will probably see a further increase in classifier performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If image datasets are truly representative of real images found in the wild, we ought to not be able to distinguish which dataset a given image originates from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_2_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are biases in the data that make each dataset distinctive. For example, there are many race cars in the ImageNet dataset, which cannot be said to represent the “platonic” concept of a car in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_2_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors further judged the value of a dataset by measuring how well a classifier trained on it performs on other datasets. By this metric, LabelMe and ImageNet are the least biased datasets, scoring  in a “basket of currencies.” The values are all less than one, which means that training on a different dataset always results in lower test performance. In an ideal world without dataset bias, some of these values should be above one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors pessimistically concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the value of current datasets when used to train algorithms that will be deployed in the real world? The answer that emerges can be summarized as: “better than nothing, but not by much”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-3-machine-learning-researchers-do-not-use-the-test-set-for-validation&quot;&gt;Myth 3: Machine Learning researchers do not use the test set for validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Machine Learning 101, we are taught to split a dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The performance of a model trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set helps the machine learning practitioner tune his model to maximize its performance in real world usage. The test set should be held out until the practitioner is done with the tuning so as to provide an unbiased estimate of the model’s actual performance in real world usage. If the practitioner “cheats” by using the test set in the training or validation process, he runs the risk of overfitting his model to biases inherent in the dataset that do not generalize beyond the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hyper-competitive world of machine learning research, new algorithms and models are often evaluated using their performance on the test set. Thus, there is little reason for researchers to write or submit papers that propose methods with inferior test performance. This effectively means that the machine learning research community, as a whole, is using the test set for validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the impact of this “cheating”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_3_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00451.pdf&quot;&gt;Do CIFAR-10 Classifiers Generalize to CIFAR-10? Recht et al. ArXiv 2018.&lt;/a&gt; investigated this by creating a new test set for CIFAR-10. They did this by parsing images from the Tiny Images repository, as was done in the original dataset collection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They chose CIFAR-10 because it is one of the most widely used datasets in machine learning, being the second most popular dataset in NeurIPS 2017 (after MNIST). The dataset creation process for CIFAR-10 is also well-documented and transparent, with the large Tiny Images repository having sufficiently fine-grained labels that make it possible to replicate a new test set while minimizing distributional shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_3_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that across a wide range of different neural network models, there was a significant drop in accuracy () from the old test set to the new test set. However, the relative ranking of each model’s performance remained fairly stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_3_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the higher performing models experienced a smaller drop in accuracy compared to the lower performing models. This is heartening, because it indicates that the loss in generalization caused by the “cheating,” at least in the case of CIFAR-10, becomes more muted as the research community invents better machine learning models and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-4-every-datapoint-is-used-in-training-a-neural-network&quot;&gt;Myth 4: Every datapoint is used in training a neural network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom says that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data&quot;&gt;data is the new oil&lt;/a&gt; and the more data we have, the better we can train our sample-inefficient and overparametrized deep learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJlxm30cKm&quot;&gt;An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting During Deep Neural Network Learning. Toneva et al. ICLR 2019.&lt;/a&gt;, the authors demonstrate significant redundancy in several common small image datasets. Shockingly,  of the datapoints in CIFAR-10 can be removed, without changing test accuracy by much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_4_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forgetting event happens when the neural network makes a misclassification at time , having already made an accurate classification at time , where we consider the flow of time to be the number of SGD updates made to the network. To make the tracking of forgetting events tractable, the authors run their neural network over only the examples in the mini-batch every time an SGD update is made, rather than over every single example in the dataset. Examples that do not undergo a forgetting event are called &lt;em&gt;unforgettable&lt;/em&gt; examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They find that  of MNIST,  of permutedMNIST,  of CIFAR-10, and  of CIFAR-100 comprise of unforgettable examples. This makes intuitive sense, since an increase in the diversity and complexity of an image dataset should cause the neural network to forget more examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_4_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgettable examples seem to display more uncommon and peculiar features than unforgettable examples. The authors liken them to support vectors in SVM, because they seem to demarcate the contours of the decision boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_4_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unforgettable examples, by contrast, encode mostly redundant information. If we sort the examples by their unforgettability, we can compress the dataset by removing the most unforgettable examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On CIFAR-10,  of the dataset can be removed without affecting test accuracy, while a  removal causes a trivial  dip in test accuracy. If this  was selected by random instead of chosen by unforgettability, then its removal will result in a significant loss of around  in test accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_4_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, on CIFAR-100,  of the dataset can be removed without affecting test accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings show that there is significant data redundancy in neural network training, much like in SVM training where the non-support vectors can be taken away without affecting the decisions of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;implication-1&quot;&gt;Implication:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can determine which examples are unforgettable before the start of training, then we can save space by removing those examples and save time by not training the neural network on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-5-we-need-batch-normalization-to-train-very-deep-residual-networks&quot;&gt;Myth 5: We need (batch) normalization to train very deep residual networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been believed for a very long time that “training a deep network to directly optimize only the supervised objective of interest (for example the log probability of correct classification) by gradient descent, starting from random initialized parameters, does not work very well.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-stacked&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, a host of clever random initialization methods, activation functions, optimization techniques, and other architectural innovations like residual connections, has made it easier to train deep neural networks with gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real breakthrough came from the introduction of batch normalization (and other subsequent normalization techniques), which constrained the size of activations at every layer of a deep network to mitigate the vanishing and exploding gradients problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09321.pdf&quot;&gt;Fixup Initialization: Residual Learning Without Normalization. Zhang et al. ICLR 2019.&lt;/a&gt;, it was shown remarkably that it is actually possible to train a -layer deep network using vanilla SGD, without resorting to any normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_5_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors compared training a residual network at varying depths for one epoch on CIFAR-10, and found that while standard initialization methods failed for  layers, both Fixup and batch normalization succeeded for  layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_5_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did a theoretical analysis to show that “the gradient norm of certain layers is in expectation lower bounded by a quantity that increases indefinitely with the network depth,” i.e. the exploding gradients problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent this, the key idea in Fixup is to scale the weights in the  layers for each of  residual branches by a factor that depends on  and .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_5_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixup enabled the training of a deep residual network with  layers on CIFAR-10 with a large learning rate, at comparable test performance with the same network architecture that had batch normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_5_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_5_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also further showed comparable test results using a Fixup-ed network without any normalization on the ImageNet dataset and English-German machine translation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-6-attention--convolution&quot;&gt;Myth 6: Attention &amp;gt; Convolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an idea gaining currency in the machine learning community that attention mechanisms are a superior alternative to convolutions. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-attention&quot;/&gt; Importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;(https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)&quot;&gt;Vaswani et al.&lt;/a&gt; noted that “the computational cost of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even state-of-the-art GANS find self-attention superior to standard convolutions in its ability to model long-range, multi-scale dependencies.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn-sagan&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkVhlh09tX&quot;&gt;Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions. Wu et al. ICLR 2019.&lt;/a&gt; question the parameter efficiency and efficacy of self-attention in modelling long-range dependencies, and propose new variants of convolutions, partially inspired by self-attention, that are more parameter-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_6_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightweight&lt;/em&gt; convolutions are depthwise-separable, softmax-normalized across the temporal dimension, shares weights across the channel dimension, and re-uses the same weights at every time step (like RNNs). &lt;em&gt;Dynamic&lt;/em&gt; convolutions are lightweight convolutions that use different weights at every time step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tricks make lightweight and dynamic convolutions several orders of magnitude more efficient that standard non-separable convolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_6_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_6_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors show that these new convolutions match or exceed the self-attention baselines in machine translation, language modelling, and abstractive summarization tasks while using comparable or less number of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-7-saliency-maps-are-robust-ways-to-interpret-neural-networks&quot;&gt;Myth 7: Saliency maps are robust ways to interpret neural networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While neural networks are commonly believed to be black boxes, there have been many, many attempts made to interpret them. Saliency maps, or other similar methods that assign importance scores to features or training examples, are the most popular form of interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to be able to conclude that the reason why a given image is classified a certain way is due to particular parts of the image that are salient to the neural network’s decision in making the classification. There are several ways to compute this saliency map, often making use of a neural network’s activations on a given image and the gradients that flow through the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10547.pdf&quot;&gt;Interpretation of Neural Networks is Fragile. Ghorbani et al. AAAI 2019.&lt;/a&gt;, the authors show that they can introduce an imperceptible perturbation to a given image to distort its saliency map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monarch butterfly is thus classified as a monarch butterfly, not on account of the patterns on its wings, but because of some unimportant green leaves in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-dimensional images often lie close to the decision boundaries constructed by deep neural networks, hence their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. While adversarial attacks shift images past a decision boundary, adversarial interpretation attacks shift them along the contour of the decision boundary, while still remaining within the same decision territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic method employed by the authors to do this is a modification of Goodfellow’s fast gradient sign method, which was one of the first efficient adversarial attacks introduced. This suggests that other more recent and sophisticated adversarial attacks can also be used to attack neural network interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://crazyoscarchang.github.io/images/2019-02-16-seven-myths-in-machine-learning-research/myth_7_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;implication-2&quot;&gt;Implication:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As deep learning becomes more and more ubiquitous in high stakes applications like medical imaging, it is important to be careful of how we interpret decisions made by neural networks. For example, while it would be nice to have a CNN identify a spot on an MRI image as a malignant cancer-causing tumor, these results should not be trusted if they are based on fragile interpretation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Last POWER1 CPU on Mars Is Dead</title>
<link>https://www.talospace.com/2019/02/the-last-power1-on-mars-is-dead.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.talospace.com/2019/02/the-last-power1-on-mars-is-dead.html</guid>
<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; Rover&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Mars Exploration Rover B (or MER-1), has finally been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/868e731d260f4919b28218dcf345071f&quot;&gt;declared at end of mission today&lt;/a&gt; after 5,352 Mars solar days when NASA was not successfully able to re-establish contact. It had been apparently knocked off-line by a dust storm and was unable to restart either due to power loss or some other catastrophic failure. Originally intended for a 90 Mars solar day mission, its mission became almost 60 times longer than anticipated and it traveled nearly 30 miles on the surface in total. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RAD6000&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or MER-2, its sister unit, had previously reached end of mission in 2010.
&lt;p&gt;And why would we report that here? Because &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; were both in fact powered by the POWER1, or more accurately a 20MHz BAE RAD6000, a radiation-hardened version of the original IBM RISC Single Chip CPU and the indirect ancestor of the PowerPC 601. There are a lot of POWER chips in space, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RAD6000&quot;&gt;with the original RAD6000&lt;/a&gt; and its successor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750&quot;&gt;RAD750&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC G3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not the end of Power ISA chips on Mars, though: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is running a pair of RAD750s (one main and one backup, plus two SPARC accessory CPUs), is still in operation at 2,319 Mars solar days and ticking. There is also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Mars_Odyssey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2001 Mars Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; orbiter, which is still circling the planet with its own RAD6000 and is expected to have enough propellant to continue survey operations until 2025. &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt;'s design is likely to be reused for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_2020&quot;&gt;Mars 2020 rover&lt;/a&gt;, meaning possibly even more Power chips will be exploring space and doing science where it counts millions of miles from home.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Automatically synchronize subtitles with video</title>
<link>https://github.com/smacke/subsync</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/smacke/subsync</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language-agnostic automatic synchronization of subtitles to video, so that subtitles are aligned to the correct starting point within the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation for this project was started during HackIllinois 2019, for which it received an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (ranked in the top 5 projects, excluding projects that won company-specific prizes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Turn this:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Into this:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/smacke/subsync/blob/master/tearing-me-apart-wrong.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/smacke/subsync/raw/master/tearing-me-apart-wrong.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/smacke/subsync/blob/master/tearing-me-apart-correct.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/smacke/subsync/raw/master/tearing-me-apart-correct.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure ffmpeg is installed. On MacOS, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install ffmpeg
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, grab the script. It should work with both Python2 and Python3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pip install git+https://github.com/smacke/subsync
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;subsync video.mp4 -i unsynchronized.srt &amp;gt; synchronized.srt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;subsync video.mp4 -i unsynchronized.srt -o synchronized.srt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it can usually work if all you have is the video file, there may be occasions where you have a correctly synchronized &quot;reference&quot; srt file in a language you are unfamiliar with, as well as an unsynchronized srt file in your native language. In this case, it will be faster to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;subsync reference.srt -i unsynchronized.srt -o synchronized.srt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether to perform voice activity detection on the audio or to directly extract speech from an srt file is determined from the file extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how one might use subsync seamlessly with real video software, we developed a prototype integration into the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; media player, which was demoed during the HackIllInois 2019 project expo. The resulting patch can be found in the file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smacke/subsync/raw/master/subsync-vlc.patch&quot;&gt;subsync-vlc.patch&lt;/a&gt;. Here are instructions for how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First clone the 3.0 maintenance branch of VLC and checkout 3.0.6:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc/vlc-3.0.git
cd vlc-3.0
git checkout 3.0.6
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next, apply the patch:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/smacke/subsync/raw/master/subsync-vlc.patch
git apply subsync-vlc.patch
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow the normal instructions on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_Developers_Corner/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VideoLAN wiki&lt;/a&gt; for building VLC from source. &lt;em&gt;Warning: this is not easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to autosynchronize subtitles using the hotkey &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+S&lt;/code&gt; (only enabled while subtitles are present).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is that &lt;code&gt;subsync&lt;/code&gt; usually finishes running in 20 to 30 seconds, depending on the length of the video. The most expensive step is actually extraction of raw audio. If you already have a correctly synchronized &quot;reference&quot; srt file (in which case the video is no longer necessary), &lt;code&gt;subsync&lt;/code&gt; typically runs in less than a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The synchronization algorithm operates in 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discretize video and subtitles by time into 10ms windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each 10ms window, determine whether that window contains speech. This is trivial to do for subtitles (we just determine whether any subtitle is &quot;on&quot; during each time window); for video, use an off-the-shelf voice audio detector (VAD) like the one built into &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;webrtc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we have two binary strings: one for the subtitles, and one for the video. Try to align these strings by matching 0's with 0's and 1's with 1's. We score these alignments as (# matching digits) - (# mismatched digits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best-scoring alignment from step 3 determines how to offset the subtitles in time so that they are properly synced with the video. Because the binary strings are fairly long (millions of digits for video longer than an hour), the naive O(n^2) strategy for scoring all alignments is unacceptable. Instead, we use the fact that &quot;scoring all alignments&quot; is a convolution operation and can be implemented with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), bringing the complexity down to O(n log n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have yet to find a case where the automatic synchronization has been off by more than ~1 second. If the reference is another subtitle file, I think it should work every time. I would expect that it could fail sometimes when the reference is a video since speech extraction is a noisier process, but I have not found any bad cases yet (currently tested on ~10 videos more than 30 minutes in length).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototype VLC patch is very experimental -- it was developed under pressure and just barely works. I would love to see this project more robustly integrated with VLC, either directly in the VLC core, or as a plugin. If you or anyone you know has ideas for how to accomplish this, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: although I have not found cases where the synchronization algorithm fails, this does not mean they don't exist. It would be good to find these cases so as to better understand the algorithm's pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project would not be possible without the following libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ffmpeg.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python&quot;&gt;ffmpeg-python&lt;/a&gt; wrapper, for extracting raw audio from video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VAD from &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;webrtc&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad&quot;&gt;py-webrtcvad&lt;/a&gt; wrapper, for speech detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/auditok/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;auditok&lt;/a&gt;, for backup audio detection if webrtcvad misbehaves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/srt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;srt&lt;/a&gt; for operating on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SRT files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/a&gt; and, indirectly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlib.org/fftpack/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FFTPACK&lt;/a&gt;, which powers the FFT-based algorithm for fast scoring of alignments between subtitles (or subtitles and video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other excellent Python libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;argparse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tqdm.github.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tqdm&lt;/a&gt;, not related to the core functionality, but which enable much better experiences for developers and users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code in this project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MIT Licensed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may not give a second thought to the tunes spinning on a constant loop at your favourite café or coffee shop, but one writer and podcaster who had to listen to repetitive music for years while working in bars and restaurants argues it's a serious workers' rights issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;[It's] the same system that's used to … flood people out of, you know,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/judge-dismisses-waco-wrongful-death-lawsuit-1.235596&quot;&gt;the Branch Davidian in Waco&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/skinny-puppy-says-its-music-used-for-torture-at-guantanamo-1.2524516&quot;&gt;was used on terror suspects in Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; — they use the repetition of music,&quot; Adam Johnson told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent&quot;&gt;The Current's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Anna Maria Tremonti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I'm not suggesting that working at Applebee's is the same as being at Guantanamo, but the principle's the same.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier this year, irritated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grubstreet.com/2019/01/starbucks-playlists-hamilton-repeat.html&quot;&gt;Starbucks employees took to Reddit to rage&lt;/a&gt; about how they had to listen to the same songs from the Broadway hit musical &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; on repeat while on the job. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/ah2m1d/if_i_have_to_hear_hamilton_one_more_time_im/&quot;&gt;One user wrote&lt;/a&gt; that if they heard a &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; song one more time, &quot;I'm getting a ladder and ripping out all of our speakers from the ceiling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johnson argues it wouldn't take years of research to understand that &quot;yes, playing the same music over and over again has a deleterious effect on one's mental well-being.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5032206.1551100771!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/adam-johnson.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Writer and podcaster Adam Johnson used to work in bars and restaurants, and argues repetitive music that gets on employees' nerves is a workers' rights issue. (Submitted by Adam Johnson)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snitch line for complaints?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a solution, he suggested health inspectors could enforce better working conditions, or a tip line could be created for people to report poor working conditions, like repetitive music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another solution? Communication, says neuroscientist Jessica Grahn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She studies music, which science has shown to be one of the strongest influencers of mood, she said. It can calm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-power-of-music-provides-comfort-to-those-with-dementia-1.4799775&quot;&gt;dementia patients&lt;/a&gt; struggling with depression or anger, or increase our endurance when we're working out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are downsides to the power of music. Unlike how we can close our eyes to things we don't want to see, we can't close our ears to sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.5032209.1551100451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jessica-grahn.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Jessica Grahn is a cognitive neuroscientist and assistant professor in the department of psychology at Western University in London, Ont. (Submitted by Jessica Grahn)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control makes a difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;So it can be a very effective way of the external environment impinging, without our control, on our sensory processing,&quot; Grahn said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Because we can't close our ears, it's very effective if somebody else has control of our sonic environment. We can do nothing about that, and that can be pretty debilitating.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having control over one's environment can make a big difference, said Grahn, which is why she recommends employers and employees talk about why certain music is being played, or what they can do to switch things up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Ryu Takahashi's composer friend couldn't stand the music at his favourite restaurant in New York. So Takahashi made the establishment a new one. He tells Anna Maria Tremonti how he did it. 1:17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I think when people have input or a sense of being listened to, that control actually makes a very big difference in their response to what they're listening to.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Irritated Starbucks employees took to Reddit in a rage last month after being subjected to a constant loop of hits from the Broadway musical Hamilton. We ask whether the constant, repetitive music employees have to endure on the job — whether in restaurants, bars, or retail — should be a workers' rights issue, and what can be done to fix it.</og:description>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19247821</guid>
<description>Hi HN!
&lt;p&gt;We’re Hannah, Esteban, Jaiden and Max, the founders of Our World in Data (&lt;a href=&quot;https://OurWorldInData.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://OurWorldInData.org&lt;/a&gt;). We’re a nonprofit in the YC W19 batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our World in Data is a website that shows how and why global living conditions and the earth's environment are changing. Is the world becoming more violent? Is an end to poverty possible? It's hard to know because daily news focuses on negative single events, and misses long-lasting changes that reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a group of researchers from the University of Oxford trying to solve this problem. We bring together data and research from many different sources often buried under jargon in static, outdated documents. We present a global perspective on living conditions and environmental change through interactive data visualizations and short explainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max started Our World in Data in 2013 whilst working as a researcher at the University of Oxford. The project was born from a frustration that we are so poorly informed about how the world is changing—we fail to notice the important developments shaping our world and are not aware what is possible for the future. It has now evolved into a full-time project with a small team of researchers and web developers (we’ll be looking for a new web developer this week!). We’re all driven by the same motivation: to make sure data and research on how the world is changing is free and accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cover many topics, ranging from poverty to health, environment, energy, education, and violence. Our data and analysis are available at global, regional and country levels. And we try to provide the longest-term data we can, often going back many decades or centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We average more than 1M users per month; these range from policymakers to journalists, academics to school teachers. But we’ve also had some use cases that took us by surprise: To many readers it’s unexpected to see that the world has made substantial progress in important aspects and psychologists have recently told us that they use our website to help patients with depression and anxiety. We did not expect this use of our work at all and asked them for more details. One of them explained: “Facts can be a powerful weapon against fear, a gloomy worldview, learned helplessness. So I help clients find facts at Our World in Data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually work remotely, because we are not all based in the same country—this is the first time that we were able to find a 3-month window of time to move to California and work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We come from a university environment and applied to YC because we wanted learn from the startup and the technology world. The work at YC and the contact with the partners and other founders have definitely given us an entirely new perspective on how to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re here at HN because we are sure we can learn a lot from the community here. We knew there had been HN threads on aspects of our work before – but after a recent search (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OWID-searches-on-HN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/OWID-searches-on-HN&lt;/a&gt;) we had no idea there were so many. It’s amazing to see that these posts created such great discussion within the HN community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our website is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://OurWorldInData.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://OurWorldInData.org&lt;/a&gt;. We are a non-profit and all our work is entirely free; open access research (Creative Commons licensed) and open source code.

<title>Practical Facts about the Human Brain</title>
<link>https://leowid.com/brain-facts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://leowid.com/brain-facts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’d have been possible for me to connect with the topic of emotional resilience without a really solid amount of scientific evidence and brain facts supporting it. As a self-identified left-brained male, I need a lot of safety signals from the world of science to really allow myself to go deeper into myself and explore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I learned about how we can stay present with difficult experiences, the latest research of neuroscience was a north star for me. I thought this would be a great opportunity to pick out some of the most practical brain facts I’ve learned over the years and also share how specifically they can support your inner well-being. Let’s check them out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.) 80% of your body’s signals are sent to the brain from the body and only 20% the other way around. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us see the brain as a kind of central command center. &lt;strong&gt;The latest research suggests that it is more of a logistics warehouse instead&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me explain what I mean. In our bodies, the largest nerve that we have is called the vagus nerve. It goes from our gut (sometimes called the “gut brain”) through our heart and lungs, all the way up to our face and ear canal into our brain. This nerve is even thicker than the spinal cord and most of us have never even heard of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vagus_16x9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-719&quot; srcset=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vagus_16x9.jpg 699w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vagus_16x9-300x169.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px&quot;/&gt;The yellow lines are your vagus nerve
&lt;p&gt;Any time you feel any feelings or sensations in your body, chances are its the vagus nerve. Feeling heart-broken? Feeling angry and frustrated? Feeling sunken and collapsed? Feeling energized and happy? All of these feelings will have had their origin as sensations from vagus nerve. And the only way you know cognitively in the first place that this is what you’re feeling is because your body has sent signals to your brain. The vagus nerves cells are 80-90% afferent. This means they send signals from the body to the brain and only 10-20% are efferent, meaning sending signals from the brain to your body to move or do something. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you can make this your ally:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the latest understandings of our human nervous system, scientists have mostly embraced the idea &lt;strong&gt;that most of our actions are unconscious with a conscious component&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking “How can I control my body?” you could experiment with saying &lt;strong&gt;“What is my body trying to tell me with that tight stomach, sunken heart, clenched shoulders?”&lt;/strong&gt; and then to hold space for that experience.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Since we’re not really in control of your bodies reactions and sensations, flipping the script and accompanying those reactions and sensations can create a whole new world. This is certainly a journey, and yet I’ve personally found that the more I can adopt that understanding, the more ease and freedom, almost as a contradiction to my need for control, do I feel in my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.) When your amygdala is active, you can’t have empathy for others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have learned about the amygdala, an almond sized part of your limbic system, sometimes called the emotion center of our brains. When you feel relaxed and alert after a good nights sleep for example, your amygdala’s activity may be balanced and show a strong linkage with your neocortex, the “thinking” part of your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go to work and hear your boss say something like “Your presentation last night really sucked!”, this may trigger your amygdala to become active very quickly, firing all sorts of signals through your brain from anger, to hurt, to fear and anxiety. If this reaches a certain amount of activity, the amygdala may “take over” your brain activity. This means it disconnects from your neocortex and kind of says “I’m in charge now”. There’s now little to no possibility for you to be in a compassionate, gentle and alert company with others up until you’ve found a way to calm your amygdala again and for your thinking brain to reconnect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researcher Dr. Dan Siegel calls this “flipping your lid”. Your “lid”, being the neocortex is no longer keeping the amygdala, your “boiling pot”, in check and it’s now bubbling and spewing about without being in check. &lt;strong&gt;Many of our most regrettable experiences happen when  we do things with a “flipped lid”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM-1024x378.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-718&quot; srcset=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM-1024x378.png 1024w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM-300x111.png 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM-768x283.png 768w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM-720x266.png 720w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-2.32.04-PM.png 1046w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left side&lt;/strong&gt; is when our amygdala is active – &lt;strong&gt;Right side&lt;/strong&gt; is connected to our prefrontal cortex
&lt;p&gt;I’ll write more about how to work with a “flipped lid”. For now, my best advice is to use your usual coping strategy that helps you to feel calm and centered again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.) A new fundamental rule of brain plasticity: When a synapse strengthens, its neighbors weaken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-scientists-discover-fundamental-rule-of-brain-plasticity-0622&quot;&gt;MIT study&lt;/a&gt; confirmed something that many of us already knew intuitively for a long time and took it further. When we take up a new habit, or develop a new response to a something we experience, the brain builds new pathways. Not only that, the other pathways, that have been in use up until that time, now become a lot weaker and less powerful. &lt;br/&gt;This means, your brain is organically de-emphazising old, no longer helpful patterns once we start developing new, more stable and versatile ones to deal with life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dendrites.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-720&quot; srcset=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dendrites.jpeg 639w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dendrites-300x200.jpeg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px&quot;/&gt;This is what our synapses look like
&lt;p class=&quot;has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How this affects us&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this brings me a lot of reassurance that whenever I do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://leowid.com/contact/&quot;&gt;emotional resilience session&lt;/a&gt;, a meditation, therapy session or other form of regulation of my emotions my brain is like a muscle that atrophies previously unused muscles and builds up these newer pathways with the resources of the pathways no longer in use. What this research also underlines for me is that doing any form of emotional resilience on a regular basis is extremely important to keep the dynamic brain pathways up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.) The emotional content of our voices is one of the most important signals of relaxation and safety to our brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard the common saying “Only 7% of our words are what matter, the rest is how we say it and body language.”. That insight originally derived from a very limited social sciences study from the 70s. Many of those popularized findings, don’t seem to hold up to our current standards of scientific knowledge. Despite that, there is some very strong evidence today, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911689&quot;&gt;the brain does rely mostly on the emotional content of the words we say, or in science terms, the “prosody” of our voices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because when we were living in the wild, hundreds of thousands of years ago, without language, the way we communicated to each other was not with words, but with sounds. A very high-pitched sound in our voice signaled fear, threat and danger to those around us, for example screaming when you see a snake. And a very low-pitched sound did the same, signaling predators growling for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium to slightly higher frequency of our voices is generally the kind that signals us the most safety. This is often the kind of voice that we make when talking to babies, where we all naturally raise our voices and speak in a kind of cooing sound. This naturally calms and soothes them, as it does for adults too. If you ever heard yourself say “you have such a calm voice”, then this is a sign of connecting with the soothing frequency of someone who is clearly signaling relaxation and safety to you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How this affects us at work and life&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever felt that people at work or in life aren’t listening to you in the way you like, even or especially when some of your ideas are later getting picked up as good ones from someone else, see if the emotional intonation of your voice could be an issue. Are you often getting excited and anxious before a presentation or raising your voice in a meeting? If so, even though your ideas may be brilliant, there’s a chance that people around you don’t pick up the words you’re saying, but instead the fear and anxiety are naturally not as interested in your ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this may be a much bigger thing to address than is space for in this article on how to work with that anxiety or stress in meetings, see if just recognizing that this may have had an impact for you before already changes things. And if there’s room, see if you can be more conscious of the intonation of your voice, where you can speak with the calmness and excitement that may be more in the range of relaxation. We can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://leowid.com/contact&quot;&gt;work with an anxiety before speaking like this in a 1:1 session&lt;/a&gt; to look at some of the deeper underlying parts to transform it into more aliveness and joy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.) Your brain has a 3 way fallback system that ends in feigning death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a brain science perspective, our body can be in 3 different kinds of states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first one is sometimes called “relaxed alertness”&lt;/strong&gt;, that’s when you feel connected to yourself and the world and you go about life happily, doing the things you enjoy doing with the people you love. In a way we can describe this as our natural place of compassion and happiness. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world generally is a happy place in this state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second state you can be in is called “&lt;strong&gt;mobilization&lt;/strong&gt;”, in this state there has been some element added to your environment that your brain intuitively identified as a threat, which may make you feel angry, frozen, startled, anxious or any other feeling you tend to feel when there’s a conscious or unconscious threat around you. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world generally seems to be a dangerous and scary place when we are in this state. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third and final state, that’s very close to us looking like we’re dead is called &lt;strong&gt;“collapse”&lt;/strong&gt;. Biologically this has partially the function to feign death when a threat has become so overwhelming that we can’t escape or respond in any way other than shut down completely. We may feel numb or very depressed in that state. &lt;strong&gt;The world seems to be a hopeless, empty and dark place when we are in this state. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-stages.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-721&quot; srcset=&quot;https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-stages.png 676w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-stages-300x223.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px&quot;/&gt;Stephen Porges’ 3 stages of the human nervous system
&lt;p class=&quot;has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make better decisions knowing the 3-way-fallback system:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a lot of us, we tend to make the best, most compassionate and harmonious decisions when we are in the first state of relaxed alertness. And yet, when we are in a state of feeling either mobilized or collapsed we’re sometimes drawn to make instinctual decisions that we may regret later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever we’re about to send an important email or make an important decision for our lives, check in with yourself and ask “Which of the 3 brain states am I in right now?”. If the answer isn’t relaxed alertness, see if instead of making the decision, if you can instead tend to your sense of feeling threatened or collapsed in another way, by having a call with a friend, going for a walk, taking a warm shower, talking to a therapist or any other coping strategy you know that helps you feel grounded and centered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.) Elevated stress changes our brain chemistry and shrinks the area connected to making goals &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard before that stress is “bad” for you. And you might have even just felt really depleted and exhausted after a stressful day and noticed how hard it is on you. From a brain perspective, there’s ample evidence how being in a stressful environment without enough time to come out of the stress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23390414&quot;&gt;changes the chemistry of your brain&lt;/a&gt;. And by doing so, the brain’s resources are being shifted. So much so, that to keep the body running with resources through such elevated and stressful times, the brain removes and even shrinks areas of your brain that are used for goal setting, being creative and makes decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.) A “trigger” is a subconscious re-activation of unintegrated memories in your brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard the term trigger before. It’s become almost ubiquitous on the internet these days. Let’s dig in a little what it is specifically from the perspective of your brain. A trigger simply speaking is an unconscious activation of a difficult, unprocessed and unintegrated memory from your past. Say you once had a teacher that shouted at you often and you felt ashamed, terrified and anxious a lot around them. That teacher was wearing a particular style of pants and shoes that were red often too. Now, since the emotional responses weren’t processed in your brain, they simply lie dormant until they have a chance to become integrated and processed by you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime however, whenever you see someone with red shoes, you may have the same feelings, emotions and responses. This is because your amygdala, the fear center of your brain, recognizes the shoes as threat from when you were a child in school. And says “hey, you’re about to get shouted at again!”, even though this event is in the past now, your emotional response may still be very present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-medium-font-size&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to integrate this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have asked me, what are signs of triggers? Sarah Peyton, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yourresonantself.com/&quot;&gt;Your Resonant Self&lt;/a&gt; offers us a great list around it: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate reactivity (becoming more angry or scared than the situation calls for)   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrusive memories (having a memory replay over and over again without choice)   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nightmares and night terrors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sudden, unpredictable drop into tears, sobbing, or irritation  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dislike of the self   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groundless dislike of others   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sense of being incapable of love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consistent feeling of shame   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sudden need to control the environment or another’s actions   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing exhaustion, fatigue, overwhelm, or the inability to concentrate   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional numbness, loss of pleasure and meaning   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypervigilance   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsession with death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of these seem true to you, chances are you may be experiencing a triggered response from your body. We’ll look more closely into this in future posts, but for now, my suggestion is that whenever you notice any of these triggers being active, see if you can take space in a way that is safe and non-reactive. This can happen by either moving into some of your favorite coping strategies, like eating a chocolate bar, going for a run, taking a warm shower and so on. Whatever your coping strategy is, if you notice it currently has a lot of negative other consequences, like alcohol or candy for example, see if you can shift them slightly to something that still feels soothing, like going from eating candy to a warm shower, but doesn’t ask for too big of a change in your coping patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing deeper work with the latest neuroscientific evidence as support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any or all of this resonates with you, and you feel inspired and curious what it would be like to really support your brain in these different states and experiences, I’d love to offer my support of working with you. It’s become my passion to study how the brain works in these different circumstances and then support people in healing through my therapy, nonviolent communication and meditation training. &lt;a href=&quot;https://leowid.com/contact/&quot;&gt;If you are interested in that, please reach out to me here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mint, a new HTTP library for Elixir</title>
<link>https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/02/25/mint-a-new-http-library-for-elixir/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/02/25/mint-a-new-http-library-for-elixir/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericmj/mint&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; is a new low-level HTTP client that aims to provide a small and functional core that others can build on top. Mint is connection based: each connection is a single struct with an associated socket belonging to the process that started the connection. Since no extra processes are started for the connection, you can choose the process architecture that better fits your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To validate this we built out the library with a common API supporting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 with automatic version negotiation. In addition, Mint comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericmj/castore&quot;&gt;CA certificate store&lt;/a&gt; to do safe by default HTTPS connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;connections-without-processes&quot;&gt;Connections without processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint HTTP connections are managed directly in the process that starts the connection, which means no connection pool is used nor new processes spawned when a connection is opened. This allows the user of the library to build their own process structure that fits their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mint each connection has a single immutable data structure that the user needs to manage. Mint uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#setopts-2&quot;&gt;“active mode”&lt;/a&gt; sockets. This means data and events from the socket are sent as messages to the process that started the connection. The user passes the messages to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt; function that returns the updated connection and a list of “responses”. Responses are streamed back which means you won’t receive a single full HTTP response back from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt;, instead the response is returned in partial response chunks. A chunk can be the status line, HTTP headers, or part of the response body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at an example of sending a request with Mint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-elixir highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Reference&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;, [{&quot;connection&quot;, &quot;keep-alive&quot;}, ...},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Reference&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;, &quot;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&quot; &amp;lt;&amp;gt; ...},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Reference&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see all calls to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mint.HTTP&lt;/code&gt; functions return an updated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conn&lt;/code&gt; which holds the state for the connection. It is important to carry on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conn&lt;/code&gt; to the next function call or the state will be corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On line 2 we send a request to the server. A reference to the request is returned: this reference is useful when sending concurrent requests, either with HTTP/1 pipelining or with HTTP/2 multiplexed streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we start a receive block waiting for a TCP active mode message and pass it to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt;. The message is parsed and the response to the request is returned. As you can see the response is split over multiple tuples: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:status&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:headers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:data&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:done&lt;/code&gt;. This is because Mint was built from the ground with streaming in mind. The parts of the response will be returned continuously as TCP messages are passed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt; so that we don’t have to wait for the full response to complete before starting to process it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the response body is larger than a single packet &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt; may return multiple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:data&lt;/code&gt; tuples and if the response includes trailing headers multiple &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:headers&lt;/code&gt; will be returned. When the response is complete &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:done&lt;/code&gt; will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you send concurrent requests on a HTTP/2 connection responses can be returned interleaved from the requests using HTTP/2’s stream multiplexing. Additionally, responses can be spread over multiple messages so we may need to continually receive messages and pass them to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stream/2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See more examples on how to use Mint in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexdocs.pm/mint&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-process-less&quot;&gt;Why process-less?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint may seem more cumbersome to use than most other HTTP libraries you have used and that is true in many ways. But by providing a low-level API without a predetermined process architecture it gives more flexibility to the user of the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times you do not need a general purpose connection pool and can avoid the additional complexity, single point of failure, and potential performance bottlenecks that it brings. For example, if you are building quick CLI scripts, you most likely don’t need a pool and performing a single one-off request with Mint is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good use case for Mint is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elixir-lang/gen_stage&quot;&gt;GenStage&lt;/a&gt;. If you write GenStage pipelines, it is most likely that you have a pool of producers that fetch data from external sources via HTTP. If you are using a high-level HTTP library, that comes with its own pool, now you have two pools, one of GenStage producers and another from the HTTP library. With Mint, you can have each GenStage producer manage its own connection, reducing overhead and simplifying the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this stops you from building a connection pool on top of Mint. The point is exactly that Mint won’t impose an architecture onto you. At the end of the day, we hope Mint will be a useful building block for more complex scenario and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;http1-and-http2&quot;&gt;HTTP/1 and HTTP/2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mint.HTTP&lt;/code&gt; module has a single interface for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections and performs version negotation on HTTPS connections, HTTP connections default to HTTP/1. You can specify which HTTP version you want to use or use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mint.HTTP1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mint.HTTP2&lt;/code&gt; modules directly if you want to use version-specific features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;safe-by-default-https&quot;&gt;Safe-by-default HTTPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When connecting over HTTPS, Mint will perform certificate verification by default. We believe it’s crucial that an HTTP library defaults to be secure out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint uses an optional dependency on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericmj/castore&quot;&gt;CAStore&lt;/a&gt; to provide certificates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s CA Certificate Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can of course tweak specific SSL settings without re-building the safe defaults yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-state-of-the-library&quot;&gt;Current state of the library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of Mint has just been released. It is an experimental library trying a new approach to building HTTP libraries so don’t expect a fully stable API yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Mint to explore new ideas for HTTP connection management and building higher level clients on top of Mint. In the future connection pooling and a higher level API may be added to supplement the current low level API, either directly to Mint or via different libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Mint is being announced in the official Elixir blog because it was originally being considered for inclusion in Elixir itself. However, at some point the Elixir team decided it doesn’t make sense to include an HTTP client in Elixir itself, at least as long as Erlang/OTP ships with a client too. Mint is not maintained by the Elixir team, although it is maintained by Eric and Andrea, who are part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your browser does not support the video tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bxJiHL&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content warning&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;This story contains discussion of serious mental health issues and racism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;PzemNe&quot;&gt;The panic attacks started after Chloe watched a man die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;B4Pm4G&quot;&gt;She spent the past three and a half weeks in training, trying to harden herself against the daily onslaught of disturbing posts: the hate speech, the violent attacks, the graphic pornography. In a few more days, she will become a full-time Facebook content moderator, or what the company she works for, a professional services vendor named Cognizant, opaquely calls a “process executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cBYDRK&quot;&gt;For this portion of her education, Chloe will have to moderate a Facebook post in front of her fellow trainees. When it’s her turn, she walks to the front of the room, where a monitor displays a video that has been posted to the world’s largest social network. None of the trainees have seen it before, Chloe included. She presses play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;PRTNt6&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Someone is stabbing him, dozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BnJxZc&quot;&gt;The video depicts a man being murdered. Someone is stabbing him, dozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life. Chloe’s job is to tell the room whether this post should be removed. She knows that section 13 of the Facebook community standards prohibits videos that depict the murder of one or more people. When Chloe explains this to the class, she hears her voice shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c7INuz&quot;&gt;Returning to her seat, Chloe feels an overpowering urge to sob. Another trainee has gone up to review the next post, but Chloe cannot concentrate. She leaves the room, and begins to cry so hard that she has trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;u6FYEQ&quot;&gt;No one tries to comfort her. This is the job she was hired to do. And for the 1,000 people like Chloe moderating content for Facebook at the Phoenix site, and for 15,000 content reviewers around the world, today is just another day at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;UieyZb&quot;&gt;Over the past three months, I interviewed a dozen current and former employees of Cognizant in Phoenix. All had signed non-disclosure agreements with Cognizant in which they pledged not to discuss their work for Facebook — or even acknowledge that Facebook is Cognizant’s client. The shroud of secrecy is meant to protect employees from users who may be angry about a content moderation decision and seek to resolve it with a known Facebook contractor. The NDAs are also meant to prevent contractors from sharing Facebook users’ personal information with the outside world, at a time of intense scrutiny over data privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZWf5aD&quot;&gt;But the secrecy also insulates Cognizant and Facebook from criticism about their working conditions, moderators told me. They are pressured not to discuss the emotional toll that their job takes on them, even with loved ones, leading to increased feelings of isolation and anxiety. To protect them from potential retaliation, both from their employers and from Facebook users, I agreed to use pseudonyms for everyone named in this story except Cognizant’s vice president of operations for business process services, Bob Duncan, and Facebook’s director of global partner vendor management, Mark Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ME0dRI&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;A content moderator working for Cognizant in Arizona will earn just $28,800 per year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PeBtAM&quot;&gt;Collectively, the employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions. It’s a place where employees can be fired for making just a few errors a week — and where those who remain live in fear of the former colleagues who return seeking vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PKbgPS&quot;&gt;It’s a place where, in stark contrast to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-employee-perks-benefits-2017-11#a-bike-repair-shop-for-menlo-park-employees-2&quot;&gt;the perks lavished on Facebook employees&lt;/a&gt;, team leaders micromanage content moderators’ every bathroom and prayer break; where employees, desperate for a dopamine rush amid the misery, have been found having sex inside stairwells and a room reserved for lactating mothers; where people develop severe anxiety while still in training, and continue to struggle with trauma symptoms long after they leave; and where the counseling that Cognizant offers them ends the moment they quit — or are simply let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;4Rv7s9&quot;&gt;The moderators told me it’s a place where the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually lead them to embrace fringe views. One auditor walks the floor promoting the idea that the Earth is flat. A former employee told me he has begun to question certain aspects of the Holocaust. Another former employee, who told me he has mapped every escape route out of his house and sleeps with a gun at his side, said: “I no longer believe 9/11 was a terrorist attack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0W3B9m&quot;&gt;Chloe cries for a while in the break room, and then in the bathroom, but begins to worry that she is missing too much training. She had been frantic for a job when she applied, as a recent college graduate with no other immediate prospects. When she becomes a full-time moderator, Chloe will make $15 an hour — $4 more than the minimum wage in Arizona, where she lives, and better than she can expect from most retail jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;E6PCxE&quot;&gt;The tears eventually stop coming, and her breathing returns to normal. When she goes back to the training room, one of her peers is discussing another violent video. She sees that a drone is shooting people from the air. Chloe watches the bodies go limp as they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MhzZM6&quot;&gt;She leaves the room again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ltNJWG&quot;&gt;Eventually a supervisor finds her in the bathroom, and offers a weak hug. Cognizant makes a counselor available to employees, but only for part of the day, and he has yet to get to work. Chloe waits for him for the better part of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nasI2S&quot;&gt;When the counselor sees her, he explains that she has had a panic attack. He tells her that, when she graduates, she will have more control over the Facebook videos than she had in the training room. You will be able to pause the video, he tells her, or watch it without audio. Focus on your breathing, he says. Make sure you don’t get too caught up in what you’re watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GEd2Ew&quot;&gt;”He said not to worry — that I could probably still do the job,” Chloe says. Then she catches herself: “His &lt;em&gt;concern&lt;/em&gt; was: don’t worry, you can do the job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;q8DuOK&quot;&gt;On May 3, 2017, Mark Zuckerberg announced the expansion of Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103695315624661?notif_t=notify_me&amp;amp;notif_id=1493820261300939&quot;&gt;“community operations”&lt;/a&gt; team. The new employees, who would be added to 4,500 existing moderators, would be responsible for reviewing every piece of content reported for violating the company’s community standards. By the end of 2018, in response to criticism of the prevalence of violent and exploitative content on the social network, Facebook had more than 30,000 employees working on safety and security — about half of whom were content moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;clV9F6&quot;&gt;The moderators include some full-time employees, but Facebook relies heavily on contract labor to do the job. Ellen Silver, Facebook’s vice president of operations, said in a blog post last year that the use of contract labor allowed Facebook to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/&quot;&gt;scale globally&lt;/a&gt;” — to have content moderators working around the clock, evaluating posts in more than 50 languages, at more than 20 sites around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KZ2tSx&quot;&gt;The use of contract labor also has a practical benefit for Facebook: it is radically cheaper. The median Facebook employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-median-pay-240000-2017-2018-4&quot;&gt;earns $240,000 annually&lt;/a&gt; in salary, bonuses, and stock options. A content moderator working for Cognizant in Arizona, on the other hand, will earn just $28,800 per year. The arrangement helps Facebook maintain a high profit margin. In its most recent quarter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/facebook-earnings-revenue-profit.html&quot;&gt;the company earned $6.9 billion in profits, on $16.9 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt;. And while Zuckerberg had &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/01/zuckerberg-facebooks-security-investments-will-significantly-impact-profitability/&quot;&gt;warned investors&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s investment in security would reduce the company’s profitability, profits were up 61 percent over the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7DymTu&quot;&gt;Since 2014, when Adrian Chen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/&quot;&gt;detailed the harsh working conditions for content moderators&lt;/a&gt; at social networks for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook has been sensitive to the criticism that it is traumatizing some of its lowest-paid workers. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/&quot;&gt;her blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Silver said that Facebook assesses potential moderators’ “ability to deal with violent imagery,” screening them for their coping skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;nOIuRv&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cognizant workers’ time is managed down to the second.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eyX5LB&quot;&gt;Bob Duncan, who oversees Cognizant’s content moderation operations in North America, says recruiters carefully explain the graphic nature of the job to applicants. “We share examples of the kinds of things you can see … so that they have an understanding,” he says. “The intention of all that is to ensure people understand it. And if they don’t feel that work is potentially suited for them based on their situation, they can make those decisions as appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1TEPsZ&quot;&gt;Until recently, most Facebook content moderation has been done outside the United States. But as Facebook’s demand for labor has grown, it has expanded its domestic operations to include sites in California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ra543M&quot;&gt;The United States is the company’s home and one of the countries in which it is most popular, says Facebook’s Davidson. American moderators are more likely to have the cultural context necessary to evaluate U.S. content that may involve bullying and hate speech, which often involve country-specific slang, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0IosJy&quot;&gt;Facebook also worked to build what Davidson calls “state-of-the-art facilities, so they replicated a Facebook office and had that Facebook look and feel to them. That was important because there’s also a perception out there in the market sometimes … that our people sit in very dark, dingy basements, lit only by a green screen. That’s really not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4vpweL&quot;&gt;It is true that Cognizant’s Phoenix location is neither dark nor dingy. And to the extent that it offers employees desks with computers on them, it may faintly resemble other Facebook offices. But while employees at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters work in an airy, sunlit complex designed by Frank Gehry, its contractors in Arizona labor in an often cramped space where long lines for the few available bathroom stalls can take up most of employees’ limited break time. And while Facebook employees enjoy a wide degree of freedom in how they manage their days, Cognizant workers’ time is managed down to the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;LJGbTw&quot;&gt;A content moderator named Miguel arrives for the day shift just before it begins, at 7 a.m. He’s one of about 300 workers who will eventually filter into the workplace, which occupies two floors in a Phoenix office park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hvqYi9&quot;&gt;Security personnel keep watch over the entrance, on the lookout for disgruntled ex-employees and Facebook users who might confront moderators over removed posts. Miguel badges in to the office and heads to the lockers. There are barely enough lockers to go around, so some employees have taken to keeping items in them overnight to ensure they will have one the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NCgv1d&quot;&gt;The lockers occupy a narrow hallway that, during breaks, becomes choked with people. To protect the privacy of the Facebook users whose posts they review, workers are required to store their phones in lockers while they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;TC2t5t&quot;&gt;Writing utensils and paper are also not allowed, in case Miguel might be tempted to write down a Facebook user’s personal information. This policy extends to small paper scraps, such as gum wrappers. Smaller items, like hand lotion, are required to be placed in clear plastic bags so they are always visible to managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GI9uaZ&quot;&gt;To accommodate four daily shifts — and high employee turnover — most people will not be assigned a permanent desk on what Cognizant calls “the production floor.” Instead, Miguel finds an open workstation and logs in to a piece of software known as the Single Review Tool, or SRT. When he is ready to work, he clicks a button labeled “resume reviewing,” and dives into the queue of posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xFGZpq&quot;&gt;Last April, a year after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/revealed-facebook-internal-rulebook-sex-terrorism-violence&quot;&gt;many of the documents had been published in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17270910/facebook-community-guidelines-appeals-process&quot;&gt;made public the community standards&lt;/a&gt; by which it attempts to govern its 2.3 billion monthly users. In the months afterward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/post-no-evil&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radiolab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published detailed investigations into the challenges of moderating such a vast amount of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;uOzQiS&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Autistic people should be sterilized” seems offensive to him, but it stays up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Jgw1Zd&quot;&gt;Those challenges include the sheer volume of posts; the need to train a global army of low-paid workers to consistently apply a single set of rules; near-daily changes and clarifications to those rules; a lack of cultural or political context on the part of the moderators; missing context in posts that makes their meaning ambiguous; and frequent disagreements among moderators about whether the rules should apply in individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mZ1rFT&quot;&gt;Despite the high degree of difficulty in applying such a policy, Facebook has instructed Cognizant and its other contractors to emphasize a metric called “accuracy” over all else. Accuracy, in this case, means that when Facebook audits a subset of contractors’ decisions, its full-time employees agree with the contractors. The company has set an accuracy target of 95 percent, a number that always seems just out of reach. Cognizant has never hit the target for a sustained period of time — it usually floats in the high 80s or low 90s, and was hovering around 92 at press time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TlyJw9&quot;&gt;Miguel diligently applies the policy — even though, he tells me, it often makes no sense to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;HCEeZJ&quot;&gt;A post calling someone “my favorite n-----” is allowed to stay up, because under the policy it is considered “explicitly positive content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7HhC1W&quot;&gt;“Autistic people should be sterilized” seems offensive to him, but it stays up as well. Autism is not a “protected characteristic” the way race and gender are, and so it doesn’t violate the policy. (“Men should be sterilized” would be taken down.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;X1txKv&quot;&gt;In January, Facebook distributes a policy update stating that moderators should take into account recent romantic upheaval when evaluating posts that express hatred toward a gender. “I hate all men” has always violated the policy. But “I just broke up with my boyfriend, and I hate all men” no longer does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dL0GDm&quot;&gt;Miguel works the posts in his queue. They arrive in no particular order at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eqdVjE&quot;&gt;Here is a racist joke. Here is a man having sex with a farm animal. Here is a graphic video of murder recorded by a drug cartel. Some of the posts Miguel reviews are on Facebook, where he says bullying and hate speech are more common; others are on Instagram, where users can post under pseudonyms, and tend to share more violence, nudity, and sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;lNl5L3&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Accuracy is only judged by agreement...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rJxiaJ&quot;&gt;Each post presents Miguel with two separate but related tests. First, he must determine whether a post violates the community standards. Then, he must select the correct reason why it violates the standards. If he accurately recognizes that a post should be removed, but selects the “wrong” reason, this will count against his accuracy score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bbXlF6&quot;&gt;Miguel is very good at his job. He will take the correct action on each of these posts, striving to purge Facebook of its worst content while protecting the maximum amount of legitimate (if uncomfortable) speech. He will spend less than 30 seconds on each item, and he will do this up to 400 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sDIOha&quot;&gt;When Miguel has a question, he raises his hand, and a “subject matter expert” (SME) — a contractor expected to have more comprehensive knowledge of Facebook’s policies, who makes $1 more per hour than Miguel does — will walk over and assist him. This will cost Miguel time, though, and while he does not have a quota of posts to review, managers monitor his productivity, and ask him to explain himself when the number slips into the 200s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;u2X6nl&quot;&gt;From Miguel’s 1,500 or so weekly decisions, Facebook will randomly select 50 or 60 to audit. These posts will be reviewed by a second Cognizant employee — a quality assurance worker, known internally as a QA, who also makes $1 per hour more than Miguel. Full-time Facebook employees then audit a subset of QA decisions, and from these collective deliberations, an accuracy score is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nctvxf&quot;&gt;Miguel takes a dim view of the accuracy figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;54YdoO&quot;&gt;“Accuracy is only judged by agreement. If me and the auditor both allow the obvious sale of heroin, Cognizant was ‘correct,’ because we both agreed,” he says. “This number is fake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;5I5AIT&quot;&gt;Facebook’s single-minded focus on accuracy developed after sustaining years of criticism over its handling of moderation issues. With billions of new posts arriving each day, Facebook feels pressure on all sides. In some cases, the company has been criticized for not doing enough — as when United Nations investigators found that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN&quot;&gt;had been complicit in spreading hate speech&lt;/a&gt; during the genocide of the Rohingya community in Myanmar. In others, it has been criticized for overreach — as when a moderator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2018/07/05/facebook-removes-post-declaration-independence/759939002/&quot;&gt;removed a post that excerpted the Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. (Thomas Jefferson was ultimately granted a posthumous exemption to Facebook’s speech guidelines, which prohibit the use of the phrase “Indian savages.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vmpVug&quot;&gt;One reason moderators struggle to hit their accuracy target is that for any given policy enforcement decision, they have several sources of truth to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8Ay3uw&quot;&gt;The canonical source for enforcement is Facebook’s public community guidelines — which consist of two sets of documents: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&quot;&gt;publicly posted ones&lt;/a&gt;, and the longer internal guidelines, which offer more granular detail on complex issues. These documents are further augmented by a 15,000-word secondary document, called “Known Questions,” which offers additional commentary and guidance on thorny questions of moderation — a kind of Talmud to the community guidelines’ Torah. Known Questions used to occupy a single lengthy document that moderators had to cross-reference daily; last year it was incorporated into the internal community guidelines for easier searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;knLKS0&quot;&gt;A third major source of truth is the discussions moderators have among themselves. During breaking news events, such as a mass shooting, moderators will try to reach a consensus on whether a graphic image meets the criteria to be deleted or marked as disturbing. But sometimes they reach the wrong consensus, moderators said, and managers have to walk the floor explaining the correct decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2Axo7Z&quot;&gt;The fourth source is perhaps the most problematic: Facebook’s own internal tools for distributing information. While official policy changes typically arrive every other Wednesday, incremental guidance about developing issues is distributed on a near-daily basis. Often, this guidance is posted to Workplace, the enterprise version of Facebook that the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13229082/facebook-work-office-enterprise-software&quot;&gt;introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Like Facebook itself, Workplace has an algorithmic News Feed that displays posts based on engagement. During a breaking news event, such as a mass shooting, managers will often post conflicting information about how to moderate individual pieces of content, which then appear out of chronological order on Workplace. Six current and former employees told me that they had made moderation mistakes based on seeing an outdated post at the top of their feed. At times, it feels as if Facebook’s own product is working against them. The irony is not lost on the moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ibYNuV&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;At times, it feels as if Facebook’s own product is working against them.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vZPz0w&quot;&gt;“It happened all the time,” says Diana, a former moderator. “It was horrible — one of the worst things I had to personally deal with, to do my job properly.” During times of national tragedy, such as the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, managers would tell moderators to remove a video — and then, in a separate post a few hours later, to leave it up. The moderators would make a decision based on whichever post Workplace served up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tnWI9M&quot;&gt;“It was such a big mess,” Diana says. “We’re supposed to be up to par with our decision making, and it was messing up our numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xEuNPz&quot;&gt;Workplace posts about policy changes are supplemented by occasional slide decks that are shared with Cognizant workers about special topics in moderation — often tied to grim anniversaries, such as the Parkland shooting. But these presentations and other supplementary materials often contain embarrassing errors, moderators told me. Over the past year, communications from Facebook incorrectly identified certain U.S. representatives as senators; misstated the date of an election; and gave the wrong name for the high school at which the Parkland shooting took place. (It is Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, not “Stoneham Douglas High School.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BBDmbF&quot;&gt;Even with an ever-changing rulebook, moderators are granted only the slimmest margins of error. The job resembles a high-stakes video game in which you start out with 100 points — a perfect accuracy score — and then scratch and claw to keep as many of those points as you can. Because once you fall below 95, your job is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Up8IP3&quot;&gt;If a quality assurance manager marks Miguel’s decision wrong, he can appeal the decision. Getting the QA to agree with you is known as “getting the point back.” In the short term, an “error” is whatever a QA says it is, and so moderators have good reason to appeal every time they are marked wrong. (Recently, Cognizant made it even harder to get a point back, by requiring moderators to first get a SME to approve their appeal before it would be forwarded to the QA.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wGgQIP&quot;&gt;Sometimes, questions about confusing subjects are escalated to Facebook. But every moderator I asked about this said that Cognizant managers discourage employees from raising issues to the client, apparently out of fear that too many questions would annoy Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5cziIy&quot;&gt;This has resulted in Cognizant inventing policy on the fly. When the community standards did not explicitly prohibit erotic asphyxiation, three former moderators told me, a team leader declared that images depicting choking would be permitted unless the fingers depressed the skin of the person being choked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;vQUb9q&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They would confront me in the parking lot and tell me they were going to beat the shit out of me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PYtHG1&quot;&gt;Before workers are fired, they are offered coaching and placed into a remedial program designed to make sure they master the policy. But often this serves as a pretext for managing workers out of the job, three former moderators told me. Other times, contractors who have missed too many points will escalate their appeals to Facebook for a final decision. But the company does not always get through the backlog of requests before the employee in question is fired, I was told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L7dERz&quot;&gt;Officially, moderators are prohibited from approaching QAs and lobbying them to reverse a decision. But it is still a regular occurrence, two former QAs told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6nVuj1&quot;&gt;One, named Randy, would sometimes return to his car at the end of a work day to find moderators waiting for him. Five or six times over the course of a year, someone would attempt to intimidate him into changing his ruling. “They would confront me in the parking lot and tell me they were going to beat the shit out of me,” he says. “There wasn’t even a single instance where it was respectful or nice. It was just, &lt;em&gt;You audited me wrong! That was a boob! That was full areola, come on man!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8xUBcH&quot;&gt;Fearing for his safety, Randy began bringing a concealed gun to work. Fired employees regularly threatened to return to work and harm their old colleagues, and Randy believed that some of them were serious. A former coworker told me she was aware that Randy brought a gun to work, and approved of it, fearing on-site security would not be sufficient in the case of an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zZdj5c&quot;&gt;Cognizant’s Duncan told me the company would investigate the various safety and management issues that moderators had disclosed to me. He said bringing a gun to work was a violation of policy and that, had management been aware of it, they would have intervened and taken action against the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cKJBh8&quot;&gt;Randy quit after a year. He never had occasion to fire the gun, but his anxiety lingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SApefM&quot;&gt;“Part of the reason I left was how unsafe I felt in my own home and my own skin,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;n9n2gS&quot;&gt;Before Miguel can take a break, he clicks a browser extension to let Cognizant know he is leaving his desk. (“That’s a standard thing in this type of industry,” Facebook’s Davidson tells me. “To be able to track, so you know where your workforce is.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GXgwVe&quot;&gt;Miguel is allowed two 15-minute breaks, and one 30-minute lunch. During breaks, he often finds long lines for the restrooms. Hundreds of employees share just one urinal and two stalls in the men’s room, and three stalls in the women’s. Cognizant eventually allowed employees to use a restroom on another floor, but getting there and back will take Miguel precious minutes. By the time he has used the restroom and fought the crowd to his locker, he might have five minutes to look at his phone before returning to his desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;REr6pJ&quot;&gt;Miguel is also allotted nine minutes per day of “wellness time,” which he is supposed to use if he feels traumatized and needs to step away from his desk. Several moderators told me that they routinely used their wellness time to go to the restroom when lines were shorter. But management eventually realized what they were doing, and ordered employees not to use wellness time to relieve themselves. (Recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-moderators-complain-big-brother-rules-accenture-austin-2019-2&quot;&gt;a group of Facebook moderators hired through Accenture in Austin complained about “inhumane” conditions related to break periods&lt;/a&gt;; Facebook attributed the issue to a misunderstanding of its policies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;RhbbxH&quot;&gt;At the Phoenix site, Muslim workers who used wellness time to perform one of their five daily prayers were told to stop the practice and do it on their other break time instead, current and former employees told me. It was unclear to the employees I spoke with why their managers did not consider prayer to be a valid use of the wellness program. (Cognizant did not offer a comment about these incidents, although a person familiar with one case told me a worker requested more than 40 minutes for daily prayer, which the company considered excessive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rZYBpp&quot;&gt;Cognizant employees are told to cope with the stress of the jobs by visiting counselors, when they are available; by calling a hotline; and by using an employee assistance program, which offers a handful of therapy sessions. More recently, yoga and other therapeutic activities have been added to the work week. But aside from occasional visits to the counselor, six employees I spoke with told me they found these resources inadequate. They told me they coped with the stress of the job in other ways: with sex, drugs, and offensive jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i8eTRW&quot;&gt;Among the places that Cognizant employees have been found having sex at work: the bathroom stalls, the stairwells, the parking garage, and the room reserved for lactating mothers. In early 2018, the security team sent out a memo to managers alerting them to the behavior, a person familiar with the matter told me. The solution: management removed door locks from the mother’s room and from a handful of other private rooms. (The mother’s room now locks again, but would-be users must first check out a key from an administrator.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;OiCWku&quot;&gt;A former moderator named Sara said that the secrecy around their work, coupled with the difficulty of the job, forged strong bonds between employees. “You get really close to your coworkers really quickly,” she says. “If you’re not allowed to talk to your friends or family about your job, that’s going to create some distance. You might feel closer to these people. It feels like an emotional connection, when in reality you’re just trauma bonding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DNLL3s&quot;&gt;Employees also cope using drugs and alcohol, both on and off campus. One former moderator, Li, told me he used marijuana on the job almost daily, through a vaporizer. During breaks, he says, small groups of employees often head outside and smoke. (Medical marijuana use is legal in Arizona.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UtjcWd&quot;&gt;“I can’t even tell you how many people I’ve smoked with,” Li says. “It’s so sad, when I think back about it — it really does hurt my heart. We’d go down and get stoned and go back to work. That’s not professional. Knowing that the content moderators for the world’s biggest social media platform are doing this on the job, while they are moderating content …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;0TAMui&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were doing something that was darkening our soul”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kJDe7L&quot;&gt;He trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zLeSeC&quot;&gt;Li, who worked as a moderator for about a year, was one of several employees who said the workplace was rife with pitch-black humor. Employees would compete to send each other the most racist or offensive memes, he said, in an effort to lighten the mood. As an ethnic minority, Li was a frequent target of his coworkers, and he embraced what he saw as good-natured racist jokes at his expense, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IAFIIT&quot;&gt;But over time, he grew concerned for his mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H4BJLP&quot;&gt;“We were doing something that was darkening our soul — or whatever you call it,” he says. “What else do you do at that point? The one thing that makes us laugh is actually damaging us. I had to watch myself when I was joking around in public. I would accidentally say [offensive] things all the time — and then be like, &lt;em&gt;Oh shit, I’m at the grocery store&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I cannot be talking like this.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k2dVZ7&quot;&gt;Jokes about self-harm were also common. “Drinking to forget,” Sara heard a coworker once say, when the counselor asked him how he was doing. (The counselor did not invite the employee in for further discussion.) On bad days, Sara says, people would talk about it being “time to go hang out on the roof” — the joke being that Cognizant employees might one day throw themselves off it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DBMmmX&quot;&gt;One day, Sara said, moderators looked up from their computers to see a man standing on top of the office building next door. Most of them had watched hundreds of suicides that began just this way. The moderators got up and hurried to the windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xwglGp&quot;&gt;The man didn’t jump, though. Eventually everyone realized that he was a fellow employee, taking a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;dMY9wp&quot;&gt;Like most of the former moderators I spoke with, Chloe quit after about a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mfTigH&quot;&gt;Among other things, she had grown concerned about the spread of conspiracy theories among her colleagues. One QA often discussed his belief that the Earth is flat with colleagues, and “was actively trying to recruit other people” into believing, another moderator told me. One of Miguel’s colleagues once referred casually to “the Holohoax,” in what Miguel took as a signal that the man was a Holocaust denier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aYwHY7&quot;&gt;Conspiracy theories were often well received on the production floor, six moderators told me. After the Parkland shooting last year, moderators were initially horrified by the attacks. But as more conspiracy content was posted to Facebook and Instagram, some of Chloe’s colleagues began expressing doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;sEJFHm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think it’s possible to do the job and not come out of it with some acute stress disorder or PTSD.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fq8spW&quot;&gt;“People really started to believe these posts they were supposed to be moderating,” she says. “They were saying, ‘Oh gosh, they weren’t really there. Look at this CNN video of David Hogg — he’s too old to be in school.’ People started Googling things instead of doing their jobs and looking into conspiracy theories about them. We were like, ‘Guys, no, this is the crazy stuff we’re supposed to be moderating. What are you doing?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V1Eyhe&quot;&gt;Most of all, though, Chloe worried about the long-term impacts of the job on her mental health. Several moderators told me they experienced symptoms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acf.hhs.gov/trauma-toolkit/secondary-traumatic-stress&quot;&gt;secondary traumatic stress&lt;/a&gt; — a disorder that can result from observing firsthand trauma experienced by others. The disorder, whose symptoms can be identical to post-traumatic stress disorder, is often seen in physicians, psychotherapists, and social workers. People experiencing secondary traumatic stress report feelings of anxiety, sleep loss, loneliness, and dissociation, among other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AqHe6e&quot;&gt;Last year, a former Facebook moderator in California sued the company, saying her job as a contractor with the firm Pro Unlimited &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm5mw5/facebook-content-moderation-lawsuit-ptsd&quot;&gt;had left her with PTSD&lt;/a&gt;. In the complaint, her lawyers said she “seeks to protect herself from the dangers of psychological trauma resulting from Facebook’s failure to provide a safe workplace for the thousands of contractors who are entrusted to provide the safest possible environment for Facebook users.” (The suit is still unresolved.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;VGEbfU&quot;&gt;Chloe has experienced trauma symptoms in the months since leaving her job. She started to have a panic attack in a movie theater during the film &lt;em&gt;Mother!&lt;/em&gt;, when a violent stabbing spree triggered a memory of that first video she moderated in front of her fellow trainees. Another time, she was sleeping on the couch when she heard machine gun fire, and had a panic attack. Someone in her house had turned on a violent TV show. She “started freaking out,” she says. “I was begging them to shut it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yZ9cBh&quot;&gt;The attacks make her think of her fellow trainees, especially the ones who fail out of the program before they can start. “A lot of people don’t actually make it through the training,” she says. “They go through those four weeks and then they get fired. They could have had that same experience that I did, and had absolutely no access to counselors after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9U12PH&quot;&gt;Last week, Davidson told me, Facebook began surveying a test group of moderators to measure what the company calls their “resiliency” — their ability to bounce back from seeing traumatic content and continue doing their jobs. The company hopes to expand the test to all of its moderators globally, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;UnTb7p&quot;&gt;Randy also left after about a year. Like Chloe, he had been traumatized by a video of a stabbing. The victim had been about his age, and he remembers hearing the man crying for his mother as he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;J4GJvZ&quot;&gt;“Every day I see that,” Randy says, “I have a genuine fear over knives. I like cooking — getting back into the kitchen and being around the knives is really hard for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ciTgjm&quot;&gt;The job also changed the way he saw the world. After he saw so many videos saying that 9/11 was not a terrorist attack, he came to believe them. Conspiracy videos about the Las Vegas massacre were also very persuasive, he says, and he now believes that multiple shooters were responsible for the attack. (The FBI found that the massacre was the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/08/03/las-vegas-police-end-investigation-into-massacre-without-definitively-determining-motive/&quot;&gt;a single gunman&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;FFsHd8&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is an infinite possibility of what’s gonna be the next job, and that does create an essence of chaos”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wppeLT&quot;&gt;Randy now sleeps with a gun at his side. He runs mental drills about how he would escape his home in the event that it were attacked. When he wakes up in the morning, he sweeps the house with his gun raised, looking for invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V84Gc1&quot;&gt;He has recently begun seeing a new therapist, after being diagnosed with PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;v8zJSo&quot;&gt;“I’m fucked up, man,” Randy says. “My mental health — it’s just so up and down. One day I can be really happy, and doing really good. The next day, I’m more or less of a zombie. It’s not that I’m depressed. I’m just stuck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Vftpi7&quot;&gt;He adds: “I don’t think it’s possible to do the job and not come out of it with some acute stress disorder or PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;emhNsd&quot;&gt;A common complaint of the moderators I spoke with was that the on-site counselors were largely passive, relying on workers to recognize the signs of anxiety and depression and seek help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KLGNav&quot;&gt;“There was nothing that they were doing for us,” Li says, “other than expecting us to be able to identify when we’re broken. Most of the people there that are deteriorating — they don’t even see it. And that’s what kills me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;rjeCaQ&quot;&gt;Last week, after I told Facebook about my conversations with moderators, the company invited me to Phoenix to see the site for myself. It is the first time Facebook has allowed a reporter to visit an American content moderation site since the company began building dedicated facilities here two years ago. A spokeswoman who met me at the site says that the stories I have been told do not reflect the day-to-day experiences of most of its contractors, either at Phoenix or at its other sites around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wqS32d&quot;&gt;The day before I arrived at the office park where Cognizant resides, one source tells me, new motivational posters were hung up on the walls. On the whole, the space is much more colorful than I expect. A neon wall chart outlines the month’s activities, which read like a cross between the activities at summer camp and a senior center: yoga, pet therapy, meditation, and a &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt;-inspired event called On Wednesdays We Wear Pink. The day I was there marked the end of Random Acts of Kindness Week, in which employees were encouraged to write inspirational messages on colorful cards, and attach them to a wall with a piece of candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;rIVU0Z&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1KbN88&quot;&gt;After meetings with executives from Cognizant and Facebook, I interview five workers who had volunteered to speak with me. They stream into a conference room, along with the man who is responsible for running the site. With their boss sitting at their side, employees acknowledge the challenges of the job but tell me they feel safe, supported, and believe the job will lead to better-paying opportunities — within Cognizant, if not Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V0hZHc&quot;&gt;Brad, who holds the title of policy manager, tells me that the majority of content that he and his colleagues review is essentially benign, and warns me against overstating the mental health risks of doing the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lPA855&quot;&gt;“There’s this perception that we’re bombarded by these graphic images and content all the time, when in fact the opposite is the truth,” says Brad, who has worked on the site for nearly two years. “Most of the stuff we see is mild, very mild. It’s people going on rants. It’s people reporting photos or videos simply because they don’t want to see it — not because there’s any issue with the content. That’s really the majority of the stuff that we see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;KoozTq&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we weren’t there doing that job, Facebook would be so ugly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f0QA1S&quot;&gt;When I ask about the high difficulty of applying the policy, a reviewer named Michael says that he regularly finds himself stumped by tricky decisions. “There is an infinite possibility of what’s gonna be the next job, and that does create an essence of chaos,” he says. “But it also keeps it interesting. You’re never going to go an entire shift already knowing the answer to every question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HBgjAc&quot;&gt;In any case, Michael says, he enjoys the work better than he did at his last job, at Walmart, where he was often berated by customers. “I do not have people yelling in my face,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AK6nsP&quot;&gt;The moderators stream out, and I’m introduced to two counselors on the site, including the doctor who started the on-site counseling program here. Both ask me not to use their real names. They tell me that they check in with every employee every day. They say that the combination of on-site services, a hotline, and an employee assistance program are sufficient to protect workers’ well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;N7QNOe&quot;&gt;When I ask about the risks of contractors developing PTSD, a counselor I’ll call Logan tells me about a different psychological phenomenon: “post-traumatic growth,” an effect whereby some trauma victims emerge from the experience feeling stronger than before. The example he gives me is that of Malala Yousafzai, the women’s education activist, who was shot in the head as a teenager by the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KvKpSW&quot;&gt;“That’s an extremely traumatic event that she experienced in her life,” Logan says. “It seems like she came back extremely resilient and strong. She won a Nobel Peace Prize... So there are many examples of people that experience difficult times and come back stronger than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AP7VUG&quot;&gt;The day ends with a tour, in which I walk the production floor and talk with other employees. I am struck by how young they are: almost everyone seems to be in their twenties or early thirties. All work stops while I’m on the floor, to ensure I do not see any Facebook user’s private information, and so employees chat amiably with their deskmates as I walk by. I take note of the posters. One, from Cognizant, bears the enigmatic slogan “empathy at scale.” Another, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bustle.com/articles/26-sheryl-sandbergs-newest-lean-in-effort-what-would-you-do-if-you-werent-afraid&quot;&gt;made famous by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt;, reads “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FJf6Aj&quot;&gt;It makes me think of Randy and his gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;L6xGxQ&quot;&gt;Everyone I meet at the site expresses great care for the employees, and appears to be doing their best for them, within the context of the system they have all been plugged into. Facebook takes pride in the fact that it pays contractors at least 20 percent above minimum wage at all of its content review sites, provides full healthcare benefits, and offers mental health resources that far exceed that of the larger call center industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ctiERV&quot;&gt;And yet the more moderators I spoke with, the more I came to doubt the use of the call center model for content moderation. This model has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11387934/internet-moderator-history-youtube-facebook-reddit-censorship-free-speech&quot;&gt;long been standard across big tech companies&lt;/a&gt; — it’s also used by Twitter and Google, and therefore YouTube. Beyond cost savings, the benefit of outsourcing is that it allows tech companies to rapidly expand their services into new markets and languages. But it also entrusts essential questions of speech and safety to people who are paid as if they were handling customer service calls for Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;tbDAFh&quot;&gt;Every moderator I spoke with took great pride in their work, and talked about the job with profound seriousness. They wished only that Facebook employees would think of them as peers, and to treat them with something resembling equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LLFzut&quot;&gt;“If we weren’t there doing that job, Facebook would be so ugly,” Li says. “We’re seeing all that stuff on their behalf. And hell yeah, we make some wrong calls. But people don’t know that there’s actually human beings behind those seats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;96yPUW&quot;&gt;That people don’t know there are human beings doing this work is, of course, by design. Facebook would rather talk about its advancements in artificial intelligence, and dangle the prospect that its reliance on human moderators will decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f1neYx&quot;&gt;But given the limits of the technology, and the infinite varieties of human speech, such a day appears to be very far away. In the meantime, the call center model of content moderation is taking an ugly toll on many of its workers. As first responders on platforms with billions of users, they are performing a critical function of modern civil society, while being paid less than half as much as many others who work on the front lines. They do the work as long as they can — and when they leave, an NDA ensures that they retreat even further into the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;2CgmHn&quot;&gt;To Facebook, it will seem as if they never worked there at all. Technically, they never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3ezSm5&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you done content moderation work for a tech giant? Email Casey Newton at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:casey@theverge.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;casey@theverge.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, send him a direct message on Twitter @&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/caseynewton&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CaseyNewton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or ask him for his Signal at either address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Famous Laws of Software Development</title>
<link>https://www.timsommer.be/famous-laws-of-software-development/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.timsommer.be/famous-laws-of-software-development/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Like any other field, the world of Software Development has some interesting and famous rules, principles and laws. Programmers, developers, managers and architects often use these in conversations, meetings and chats. More than often we tend to nod along, not willing to let our conversation partner know we've actually never heard of these Brook, Moore or Wirth characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These laws consist of rules, principles, or famous words from great and inspiring persons in the development world. At the same time they are interesting, funny, worth knowing, and all have great back-stories which are amazing to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I am going to share my collection, interpretation and thoughts on the most famous and most used laws in Software Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind-off a big post, so I've included an index if you want to skip some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;murphyslaw&quot;&gt;Murphy's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most famous of all laws, mostly because it is not only applicable to Software Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something can go wrong, it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First derivation:&lt;/strong&gt; If it works, you probably didn't write it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second derivation:&lt;/strong&gt; Cursing is the only language all programmers speak fluently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; A computer will do what you write, not what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defensive programming, version control, doom scenario's (for those damned zombie-server-attacks), TDD, MDD, etc. are all are good practices for defending against this law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;brookslaw&quot;&gt;Brook's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers will -either knowingly or unknowingly- have experience with Brook's law, which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a project is running late, simply adding manpower will most likely have disastrous results. Looking and reviewing the level of programming efficiency, the software methodology, the technical architecture, etc. will almost always have better outcomes. Or not, which probably means Hofstadter's Law is also in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hofstadterslaw&quot;&gt;Hofstadter's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.timsommer.be/content/images/2017/12/hofstader-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hofstader-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hofstadter's law was written by Douglas Hofstadter and named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This law is -off course- not to be confused with Leonard Hofstadter from the Big Bang theory. Even though his quotation will make sense to some you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;law&quot; is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why you must always have a buffer before you give any sort of estimation. If you want to know more on how to provide better estimations, read my post on the subject: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timsommer.be/estimation-wizardry&quot;&gt;Estimation Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conwayslaw&quot;&gt;Conway’s Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even more clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many organizations teams are divided according to their functional skills. So you'll have teams of front-end developers, backend-developers and database developers. Simply stated, it's hard for someone to change something if the thing he/she wants to change is owned by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much better, and more and more implemented as such, to deploy teams around a bounded context. Architectures such as microservices structure their teams around service boundaries rather than siloed technical architecture partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, structure teams to look like your target architecture, and it will be easier to achieve it. That's how you defend against Conways's law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;postelslawakarobustnessprinciple&quot;&gt;Postel's Law aka Robustness principle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Postel originally articulated this as a principle for making TCP implementations robust. This principle is also embodied by HTML which many attribute as a cause of its success and failure, depending on who you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's highly charged political environment, Postel's law is a uniter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;paretoprincipleakathe8020rule&quot;&gt;Pareto Principle aka The 80-20 rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many phenomena, 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the principle behind the painful truth that 80% of the bugs in the code arise from 20% of the code.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise stated, 80% of the work done in a company is performed by 20% of the staff. The problem is you don't always have a clear idea of which 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thepeterprinciple&quot;&gt;The Peter Principle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty depressing and at times frustrating law, certainly if you happen to have firsthand experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read Dilbert (or watch The Office) to get some examples of this in action.&lt;br/&gt;As for Dilbert, this one is far out my favorite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.timsommer.be/content/images/2017/12/dilvert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dilvert&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kerchkhoffsprinciple&quot;&gt;Kerchkhoff's Principle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cryptography, a system should be secure even if everything about the system, except for a small piece of information - the key - is public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main principle underlying public key cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linusslaw&quot;&gt;Linus's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Named after Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, this law states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This law was described using the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&quot;&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; essay, explaining the contrast between two different free software development models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Cathedral model, in which source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of software developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bazaar model, in which the code is developed over the &lt;strong&gt;Internet in view of the public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion? The more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mooreslaw&quot;&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of computers per unit cost doubles every 24 month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular version states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double in about 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing speed of computers will double every two years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.timsommer.be/content/images/2017/12/moore.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wirthslaw&quot;&gt;Wirth's law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take that Moore's Law!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ninetyninetyrule&quot;&gt;Ninety-ninety rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 90% of the code takes 10% of the time. The remaining 10% takes the other 90% of the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So true. Anyone who does not agree with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;knuthsoptimizationprinciple&quot;&gt;Knuth's optimization principle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.timsommer.be/content/images/2017/12/optimization.png&quot; alt=&quot;optimization&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you write code, then you identify bottlenecks, then you fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;norvigslaw&quot;&gt;Norvig's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any technology that surpasses 50% penetration will never double again (in any number of months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these 'laws' as they each have their own story, their own background. And as a consultant or architect you have to familiarize yourself with them. So for me, and possibly for you, I know have a list of the most used and most famous laws in Software Development!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I miss your favorite law? Do (or don't) you agree with each law, or have any (funny) experience with one of them? What is your favorite? Let me know using the comment section!&lt;/p&gt;
