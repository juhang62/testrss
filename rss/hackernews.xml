<title>The Attempted Corporate Takeover of .Org</title>

<description>&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;On Friday, activists will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/savedotorg-protest-icann&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;take to the streets&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles to attempt to prevent a consequential giveaway of an obscure piece of technological architecture. A newly formed private equity firm named &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethoscapital.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ethos Capital&lt;/a&gt; is bidding to take over the registry that handles the .org domain, which is reserved for nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations. Ethos would be able to raise prices without limit on website owners, and it could use its power to sell the browsing data of users of .orgs, which include practically every human rights organization in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement of the proposed purchase, .org owners, advocacy groups, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.01.16%20Letter%20to%20ICANN%20about%20sale%20of%20.ORG%20registry.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; have howled in protest of this injection of the profit motive into a rare unspoiled, public service–focused corner of the internet. As a full disclosure, the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt; is one of those nonprofits with a .org website, and we are a signatory to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/help-stop-the-sale-of-public-interest-registry-to-a-private-equity-firm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; opposing the sale, joined as of Tuesday by over 21,000 individuals and over 600 organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire market for domain name registries is broken, a troubling combination of government-granted monopoly, disinterested (at best) regulators, and eager extractors of profit. Users pay a relatively trivial amount for the rights to website names, and don’t really notice the enormous amounts of excess profit taken from them and hundreds of millions of their colleagues, a few bucks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire market for domain name registries is broken, a troubling combination of government-granted monopoly, disinterested (at best) regulators, and eager extractors of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verisign controls the registries for .com and .net, two of the internet’s most popular. All it does is administer a database and collect small sums from website owners, but with computing power rising and practically no marginal cost to adding another website to the database, the entire enterprise is a license to print money. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1014473/000101447319000037/vrsn-2019930x10q.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;third quarter of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Verisign showed operating income of $205.6 million on $308.4 million in revenues, a profitability margin of 66.67 percent. This makes Verisign one of the most profitable companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verisign’s competitors have consistently offered to provide the same service at a fraction of what Verisign charges, but the company has an exclusive contract to manage .com and .net with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&lt;/a&gt; (ICANN), a nonprofit that oversees top-level domains. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/special-investigation-the-dirty-secret-behind-warren-buffetts-billions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote about Verisign for &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because .org serves nonprofits, ICANN created a purpose-driven organization 16 years ago to safeguard it. The Internet Society (ISOC) founded a subsidiary, the Public Interest Registry (PIR), to carry out this mission, seeding it with a grant of $5 million. “The entire purpose of this organization is to stop this from happening,” said writer Cory Doctorow, a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is leading the charge against the sale of .org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these two firms actually manage the .org database; they pay a third firm to handle that. But even after writing a check to PIR, which writes a check to the third party, ISOC manages to make tens of millions of dollars, which feeds a series of side projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internetsociety.org/issues/access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building community networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internetsociety.org/issues/access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other activities&lt;/a&gt; to increase access. The projects are laudable but orthogonal to the mission of protecting .org. “ISOC has a weird idea of its purpose, it thinks the side projects are the rationale,” Doctorow said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, ICANN &lt;a href=&quot;https://reviewsignal.com/blog/2019/07/01/icann-fails-the-internet-community-allows-an-unlimited-non-profit-tax/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decided to lift the cap&lt;/a&gt; on price increases on .org domains, allowing for unlimited hikes. Over 98 percent of the comments to the ICANN website opposed this change, to no avail. ICANN’s board didn’t even approve it; staff members negotiated and finalized the agreement, in the form of a contract extension with the Public Interest Registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made it all the more suspicious when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191125/23132643458/sketchy-sketchy-case-icann-execs-self-dealing-regarding-org-domain.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;former ICANN staff&lt;/a&gt; subsequently formed Ethos Capital, the private equity firm that would snap up the rights to .org. Former ICANN Senior Vice President Nora Abusitta-Ouri is one of two Ethos Capital employees (she serves as its “chief purpose officer”), and Fadi Chehadé, former ICANN CEO, registered EthosCapital.org (note the irony of the domain suffix) last May. (It’s since been changed to a .com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-12/dot-org-sale-outrage-internet-society-ethos-capital&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Financial backers of Ethos&lt;/a&gt; include the family fortunes of Ross Perot and Mitt Romney (or at least his son Tagg). Erik Brooks is the founder/CEO of Ethos; he previously worked at Abry Partners, which bought the domain registry Donuts in 2018. Jonathon Nevett, co-founder of Donuts, is now CEO of the Public Interest Registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have a bunch of people involved in the domain registry industry and its chief regulator responding to the new profit-making opportunity for .org by creating a private equity firm, and making its biggest investment the company that runs .org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofit websites will be trapped: If they want to keep their longtime brand and their archives, they’ll pay whatever price. “When you buy a domain you own it, but after a couple years it owns you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethos &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/2019/11/13/breaking-private-equity-company-acquires-org-registry/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced the purchase&lt;/a&gt; of PIR in November, for a whopping $1.135 billion. Some $360 million of that is debt-financed, and as per usual with private equity, that will be thrown on PIR to service. Ethos must believe PIR will be so profitable that it can handle the debt load and still provide extra-normal returns, on the backs of nonprofits with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISOC’s strange reason for selling PIR is that the $1.135 billion price tag will serve as an endowment for their various projects. “They’ve said that with all these new domain names out there, .org will be worth less,” said Doctorow. “But if .org stops mattering, we don’t need ISOC anymore. Handing them a billion dollars will not help nonprofits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the deal goes through, Ethos would have the ability to raise prices on .orgs to its heart’s content. They’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/commitments-in-certificate-of-formation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made a vague, nonbinding promise&lt;/a&gt; to voluntarily limit increases to 10 percent year over year, which itself is a pretty sweet deal considering that the overhead—a database and some computing power—only ever drops in cost. Ethos would not be restricted from charging “premium” prices to certain websites, based on their ability to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their part, .orgs will be trapped: If they want to keep their longtime brand and their archives, they’ll pay whatever price. “When you buy a domain you own it, but after a couple years it owns you,” said Doctorow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, domain registries have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/we-need-save-org-arbitrary-censorship-halting-private-equity-buy-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;troubling history&lt;/a&gt; of restricting the domains they manage. Typically this censorship has been at the behest of corporate titans who either want to suppress information that looks disfavorably on them, or claim a copyright infringement. Outlets that cover private equity, like the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;produced the Panama Papers&lt;/a&gt;), are .orgs, so private equity firms might have their own reason to suppress certain sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ethos could extend this to autocratic regimes, which would have a definite interest in curtailing the speech of .org NGOs and human rights groups. Censorship could become a profit center, where Ethos asks for a “takedown fee” to suppress a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://prospect.org/topics/david-dayen/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from David Dayen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registries can also track user visits to .org websites and sell that data worldwide. That information in the hands of an authoritarian government could be deadly. Ethos owns an advertising company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vidmob.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vidmob&lt;/a&gt;, which could also misuse data from .orgs. And .org sites that lapse could be resold to spammers, who would get access to all the emails that mistakenly go to those sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is another issue. As we know, when private equity firms throw debt upon the companies they buy and demand high returns anyway, there’s little recourse for those companies but to cut corners on labor and equipment. Technical upkeep of .org domains could be at risk, with the effect of lingering website failures. With .org NGOs that provide vital information, that impact is magnified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the kind of boring, important thing where a lot of mischief happens,” Doctorow said, and he’s right. The .org takeover will not drive headlines, but it could put people around the world in danger, in addition to extracting profit from nonprofit entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN must sign off on the deal in order for it to proceed. In December, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyalts.com/icann-pauses-pir-sale-30-days/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paused the sale for 30 days&lt;/a&gt; amid public outcry, expressing concern about the lack of transparency surrounding the deal. ICANN founding chairman Esther Dyson has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edyson/status/1199118703591350272&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called the sale&lt;/a&gt; “the great .org heist.” The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/event/savedotorg-protest-icann&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protest on Friday&lt;/a&gt; will take place at ICANN headquarters in Los Angeles at 9 a.m. PT. Congressional Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/lawmakers-urge-internet-governing-body-to-block-private-equity-firm-ethos-capital-from-taking-over-the-org-internet-domain-name-registry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;questioned the sale&lt;/a&gt; in a letter last week. “The Ethos Capital takeover of the .ORG domain fails the public interest test in numerous ways,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.01.16%20Letter%20to%20ICANN%20about%20sale%20of%20.ORG%20registry.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the six Democrats wrote&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, slowing down the deal has increased the scrutiny. “This kind of thing has to get done fast or it doesn’t get done at all,” Doctorow said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members of ISOC, including Mike Godwin, inventor of the term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Godwin’s Law&lt;/a&gt;,” have pushed back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/heres-how-we-can-truly-savedotorg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defending the deal&lt;/a&gt; as “the best way to ensure that .org grows and thrives in the rest of this century.” But the private equity sale is only an example of the gradual fleecing of website users for a product that should cost pennies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the country has an interest in a vibrant internet, especially for nonprofits operating as a public service, registries should be public and impervious to this kind of capture. Even the threat of a .org takeover should never have occurred. For that matter, Verisign’s monopoly of .com and .net makes no sense either. ICANN has a choice to make: whether to continue to enable private actors undermining their mission to protect the internet, or to belatedly take a stand against the profiteering and threats to security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>U.S. surveillance laws have proven ineffective at countering terrorism</title>
<link>https://theprivacyissue.com/government-surveillance/united-states-of-surveillance-us-history-spying</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theprivacyissue.com/government-surveillance/united-states-of-surveillance-us-history-spying</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decay of individual privacy in the United States has been closely intertwined with the evolution of national security programs – accelerated in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when a deluge of legislative measures were passed in the name of preventing further terrorism. The true extent of intelligence programs and the effect they have had on civil liberties has been brought to light largely thanks to whistleblower leaks over the years, notably those revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013. Yet despite public outcry – and evidence of inefficacy – no substantial reforms have been made to redress the privacy harms that the post-9/11 intelligence landscape has caused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. citizens today continue to live in a surveillance state that increasingly reaches into other parts of the globe. Under the Trump administration, the mass monitoring of electronic communications has been fueled by ever-more-powerful technological tools, developed hand-in-hand with private sector companies and targeted at undocumented immigrants, Muslim Americans, and other vulnerable populations. In this climate of weakened civil liberties and racial and religious profiling, &lt;em&gt;The Privacy Issue&lt;/em&gt; looks back on key developments in the past two decades of mass surveillance in the United States – and enlists the expert insight of Neema Singh Guliani, Senior Legislative Counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, to shed light on the questions we should be asking ourselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two decades following the establishment of the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 1952, there was very little regulation stipulating how government agencies could collect information on individuals. That changed in 1973, when the Supreme Court ruled that warrants were required for domestic intelligence surveillance. Two years later, the Senate’s  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/church/contents_church_reports_vol5.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Church Committee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigation found that the NSA had been illegally spying on anti-war protestors, activists, and political opponents. The committee prophetically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/investigations/ChurchCommittee.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that the two main legal authorities regulating U.S. spy activities came into effect – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1978 (FISA), and Executive Order 12333, signed by President Reagan in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed into law in 1975, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/fisa/#Overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;establishes procedures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the government’s collection of foreign powers and their agents. It also permits surveillance against U.S. citizens and other people on U.S. territory if the surveillance agency can demonstrate probable cause that the person is engaged in espionage or terrorism on behalf of a foreign power. While the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ordinarily requires law enforcement to apply for a court-issued warrant to conduct a search, warrants issued under FISA are processed by a specially-established court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which conducts its hearings in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/01/AR2009030101730.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;utmost secrecy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Surveillance methods under FISA were originally limited to electronic monitoring and wiretapping, and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/miscellaneous/ForeignIntelligenceSurveillanceAct.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;later expanded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to physical searches (1995) and pen registers and trap devices (1998). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Order 12333 (1981)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Order 12333 stipulates what, when, and how all 17 U.S. intelligence organizations can collect information about citizens and foreign nationals abroad. It allows for the dragnet monitoring of not only the metadata of foreign nationals’ communications (e.g. when and how long calls were made) but also their content (i.e. what was said during them) to be monitored en masse. If the content of a U.S. citizen’s call is collected “incidentally” in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence mission, it may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/meet-executive-order-12333-the-reagan-rule-that-lets-the-nsa-spy-on-americans/2014/07/18/93d2ac22-0b93-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;retained for five years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without the need for suspicion of that person’s wrongdoing. Because the Order is not a statute, it is not subject to oversight by the courts or Congress – therefore many loopholes and broadly interpreted clauses have allowed the Order to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/three-leaks-three-weeks-and-what-weve-learned-about-governments-other-spying#sp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;used intensively&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for surveillance purposes. Many of these purposes are classified, but a series of disclosures over the years have shed light on some of them over recent years. According to the EFF, these include empowering the NSA’s top-level hacking department, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-fdp-politiker-baum-fuer-eingreifen-des-generalbundesanwalts-a-941418.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tailored Operations Unit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the NSA’s capability to record &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-surveillance-program-reaches-into-the-past-to-retrieve-replay-phone-calls/2014/03/18/226d2646-ade9-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html,%20https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/primer-executive-order-12333-mass-surveillance-starlet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;100 percent of a foreign country's telephone calls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, the collection of U.S. citizens’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_print.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;email contacts and friend lists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the infiltration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google and Yahoo data centers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the 9/11, the Bush administration acted swiftly to implement a host of legal and policy changes in the name of national security. Their lasting effect, however, has been to establish a landscape of surveillance on U.S. citizens – as the Snowden Files would come to reveal in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USA Patriot Act (2001)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 215 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/03162&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;USA Patriot Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2001) enabled and strengthened many forms of dragnet government surveillance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/other/how-anti-terrorism-bill-puts-cia-back-business-spying-americans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;allowing the CIA to access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a wide range of sensitive information on U.S. citizens. This included phone and email communication, Internet use, bank and credit reporting record, school records, and details of criminal investigations and grand jury proceedings. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act?redirect=national-security/surveillance-under-patriot-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;infographic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published by the American Civil Liberties Union brings into focus how the Act’s provisions – passed under the banner of preventing terrorism – have denied U.S. citizens of their civil liberties, and has had the effect of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;turn[ing] regular citizens into suspects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Shortly after the Patriot Act was signed into law, the Information Awareness Office was created as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its stated goal of &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; was implemented via a mass surveillance program that collected information about every person in the U.S. in vast electronic databases without a search warrant. This included highly sensitive personal information including medical records, bank transactions and travel documents. The highly-criticized program was shut down in late 2003. Much of the information gathered under it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/every-move-you-make-obama-nsa-security-surveillance-spying-intelligence-snowden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;transferred to the NSA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stellarwind (2003)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key element of the NSA &quot;President’s Surveillance Program&quot; – as revealed by the Snowden leaks in 2013 – was Stellarwind, the code name for a program that allowed the NSA to monitor call and text metadata of U.S. citizens and tap any international calls that included a U.S.-based caller. Millions of electronic communications were scanned on a daily basis via AT&amp;amp;T’s facilities and satellites to search for associations with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda, and leads were forwarded to the FBI. A classified internal FBI document from 2006 revealed there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-the-evidence-mass-surveillance-works-not-much&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;no evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Stellarwind was successful in preventing terrorism. The program was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/nsa-phone-records-program-shut-down.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shut down in early 2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRISM &amp;amp; Upstream (2007-)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRISM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an NSA internet surveillance tool created to collect the private Internet data of foreign nationals – but in doing so, also sweeps up the data of U.S. citizens, including emails, files and photos, through accessing user accounts on Gmail, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies. PRISM, and its partner program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/upstream-prism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Upstream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – which infiltrates the infrastructure of the Internet to copy and filter its traffic — came to light in the Snowden leaks of 2013, when the former NSA contractor and whistleblower shared a classified 43-page document detailing the inner workings of PRISM with journalists at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly afterward, the Obama administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/prismfactsheet0608.pdf?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;declassified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; some information about PRISM, which further intensified the nationwide reckoning with the realities of mass surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FISA Amendments Act (2008)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the Bush Administration passed the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which added Section 702 to FISA. Its effect was to significantly expand the NSA’s surveillance powers by removing the requirement for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/nsa-gets-more-latitude-to-share-intercepted-communications.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;intelligence agencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a warrant in order to surveil communications between Americans and foreign targets. Section 702, which involved the PRISM and Upstream programs, resulted in the “incidental collection” of communication between thousands of Americans who were not under suspicion of breaking any laws. In 2018, Senate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/nsa-surveillance-programs-upstream-prism-edward-snowden-renewed-senate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;renewed Section 702&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without debate of reforms proposed by privacy advocates – ones that would have limited cross-agency data sharing by requiring the FBI to be obtain a warrant before accessing the information the NSA collected via PRISM and Upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amendments to Executive Order 12333 (2008)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same month that the FISA Amendments Act was passed, President Bush signed off on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-58-no-2/pdfs/Slick-Modernizing%20the%20IC%20Charter-June2014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;amendments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Executive Order 12333, which allowed the NSA to share its findings with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dni.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Director of National Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – subject to certain rules created with the Attorney General and Defense Secretary. As the New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/nsa-gets-more-latitude-to-share-intercepted-communications.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it took eight more years for those rules to be negotiated. They stipulate that any evidence of an American committing a crime that is found incidentally in the course of foreign intelligence operations must be shared with the Justice Department. Furthermore, they permit analysts to use metadata (logs revealing who contacted whom and when they did so) to investigate unknown associates of targeted suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after entering the U.S. Senate in 2005, Barack Obama gave a speech imploring his fellow senators not to renew the Patriot Act. “If someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document […] this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/every-move-you-make-obama-nsa-security-surveillance-spying-intelligence-snowden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;argued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a speech defending civil liberties. “This is just plain wrong.” Over the next three years, with the Iraq War raging and critical opponents accusing him of being weak on terrorism, Obama had changed tack, aligning himself with former CIA director John Brennan – whose views he had once rallied against – and writing on a campaign blog, “In a dangerous world, government must have the authority to collect the intelligence we need to protect the American people.” Once in power, Obama’s years as President saw him implement a wide range of surveillance measures, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extensive cooperation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the Five Eyes network an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/obama-expands-surveillance-powers-his-way-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extension of the NSA’s information sharing powers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just days before leaving office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOMALGET &amp;amp; MYSTIC (2009–2014)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first major surveillance developments under Obama was a program that listened to the content of phone conversations of a country’s entire population – that of the Bahamas. In 2009, the NSA infiltrated the communication networks of the Bahamas under the guise of a mission to clamp down on illegal drug trading. Unbeknownst to Bahamian officials, however, the monitoring technology allowed the NSA to monitor and record every phone conversation going to, from or within the Bahamas. Within two years, it had achieved &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;100% warrantless surveillance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – including snooping on the phone conversations of the millions of U.S. residents who visited annually or owned homes there. Calls were intercepted, surreptitiously recorded, and their &quot;full take audio&quot; could be replayed for up to 30 days. In their exposé published by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Intercept&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, journalists Ryan Devereaux, Glenn Greenwald, and Laura Poitras reported that the country’s relatively small population provided a manageable “test bed for system deployments, capabilities, and improvements” – in other words, a test case for this powerful technology that could be then fine-tuned and deployed elsewhere on a larger scale.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas spy operation was named&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SOMALGET, which formed part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-surveillance-program-reaches-into-the-past-to-retrieve-replay-phone-calls/2014/03/18/226d2646-ade9-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;MYSTIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a formerly classified NSA program that spied on the phone calls of the entire populations of five countries. In addition to the Bahamas, the contents of call conversations in Afghanistan were monitored. MYSTIC also recorded the metadata of phone calls in Kenya, Mexico and the Philippines – covertly tracking the communication records of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/03/10-spy-programmes-with-silly-codenames-used-by-gchq-and-nsa/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;250 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snowden Revelations (2013–) &amp;amp; The USA Freedom Act (2015)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/snowden-revelations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edward Snowden’s disclosures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the U.S. intelligence community’s surveillance activities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/snowden-revelations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;public debate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and international outrage led to pressure on the Obama administration to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-04-17/reforming-nsa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reform the NSA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The USA Freedom Act was passed in 2015 to replace the once-covert mass collection of Americans’ call records under section 215 of the Patriot Act. Under the new Act, call and text data remains in the possession of telecom companies, and the NSA was only allowed to request specific records relating to a surveillance target with terrorism links, as authorized by a judge. Under the Freedom Act, the NSA collected a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/nsa-surveillance-2017-annual-report.html?module=inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;695 million call-detail records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2016-2017, and it was revealed in 2018 that due to “technical irregularities” the agency was in possession of vast amounts of call detail record and metadata that it “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/nsa-phone-records-program-shut-down.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;had no authority to receive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The organization began &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1618691/nsa-reports-data-deletion/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;purging its database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of these records in May 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance Failures Brought to Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the international public outcry triggered by the Snowden revelations, the Obama administration went to great lengths to justify the U.S. intelligence community’s invasion into the private lives of its citizens. In a speech during a visit to Berlin in 2013, Obama claimed he knew of over 50 terrorist threats that had been thwarted due to the information collected by the NSA’s unlawful spying operations, but did not offer examples. In October of the same year, the then-NSA director, General Keith Alexander, was called to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and failed to substantiate the stated justifications for the surveillance programs. “Alexander cited only one instance when an intercept detected a potential threat: a Somali taxi driver living in San Diego who sent $8,500 to al-Shabab, his home country’s notorious terrorist group,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/every-move-you-make-obama-nsa-security-surveillance-spying-intelligence-snowden/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, a panel established to review NSA operations came to the conclusion that zero terrorist attacks were prevented by the NSA under any legislation that was claimed to have been passed for the purpose of twarting attacks. In 2014, the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board further confirmed this in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;report on mass surveillance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the civil liberties of U.S. citizens and people all around the world had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/human_rights_vol38_2011/human_rights_winter2011/privacy_and_surveillance_post_9-11/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dismantled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They had been replaced by what law professors Jack Balkin and Sandy Levinson termed a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;amp;context=schmooze_papers&quot;&gt;national surveillance state&lt;/a&gt;” – one devoid of new laws to protect individual privacy and counter government abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenging the Argument of Necessity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence of the efficacy of mass surveillance programs, the U.S. government continued to insist that national security legislation and its controversial provisions were necessary to keep citizens safe and the country’s borders secure. &lt;em&gt;The Privacy Issue&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Neema Singh Guliani, Senior Legislative Council at ACLU, to examine this claim. “We don’t have a lot of information about efficacy, but some of what we have calls into question whether mass surveillance programs have been efficient,” Singh Guliani said. “The program we have the most public information about is the 'call detail program' [PRISM], as revealed by Snowden. Initially it was revealed that the government was collecting call records of virtually every U.S. individual. This program was reformed through legislation in 2015, but even since then the government has continued to collect massive numbers of records, and there have been compliance issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even more important question than whether the NSA’s programs were effective for their purported purpose, according to Singh Guliani, is whether they could have achieved the same outcome with a program that respected privacy and civil liberties. “Even if a program has efficacy, there are human rights and constitutional rights at play – certain lines you can’t cross, as constitutional and international law prohibits it,” she explains. “The example I often hear is 'if police could enter your home at any time with no cause, would there be cases where they might find evidence of a crime?' The answer is often yes. But are the police allowed to [enter homes without a warrant] under the Fourth Amendment? Absolutely not. That's prohibited under the United States Constitution, given the requirement for probable cause and a warrant, among other things. There are still certain constitutional restrictions on what the government can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since President Trump took office in 2017, constitutional restrictions on surveillance have been weakened considerably. Surveillance has become targeted – both internally (at activists, protesters and dissenters) and at the U.S. borders (at those trying to enter the country).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/07/24/documents-show-department-homeland-security-monitoring-black-lives-matter-since-ferguson/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Lives Matter activists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and those participating in protests against &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;police brutality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson in 2014 have been targeted through social media monitoring and overhead surveillance flights. The U.S.-Mexico Border has become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/atlas-surveillance-us-mexico-border-communities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;new frontier in surveillance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A range of tools, including drones, body cameras, automated license plate readers, and facial recognition, are used to keep tabs at those wishing to enter the U.S., as well as undocumented immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) works closely with privately-owned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/30/20728147/tech-company-ice-contracts-foia-microsoft-palantir-concur-dell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tech companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like Amazon, Microsoft, and Dell, who are providing them with the software they need for surveillance in near-real time. The result is a technologically-sophisticated and highly-targeted surveillance apparatus that has been instrumental to President Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/year-trump-shrinking-space-protests-171226135130984.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;oppression of opposition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/collections/the-war-on-immigrants/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;war on immigration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/20/16913534/president-donald-trump-signed-fisa-amendments-reauthorization-act-of-2017-section-702&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;signed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4478&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into law, which extends foreign intelligence collection powers under the controversial section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act until 2023. While section 702 officially governs foreign intelligence by U.S. authorities, it allows for a back door into the communications of U.S. citizens through programs like the NSA’s PRISM. The Reauthorization Act of 2017 further extended the NSA’s powers by allowing the interception of communications that are not only to or from a target of surveillance, but also communications which simply mention that target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Vetting Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 2018 marked a turning point in the convergence between national security, law enforcement, and immigration with the establishment of the National Vetting Enterprise (NVE), part of the National Vetting Center (NVC). Under the NVE, a host of new sources of data, paired with a wide range of technologies for scraping, analyzing, and sharing that data, give immigration authorities highly-effective tools for real-time monitoring of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/national-vetting-enterprise-artificial-intelligence-and-immigration-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;everyone who&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “seek[s] a visa, visa waiver, or an immigration benefit, or a protected status” in the United States. In a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaiusa.org/aai_issue_brief_surveillance&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; by the Arab American Institute, which reviewed official and leaked reports on terrorism and customs and border protection, the continuation of President Trump’s targeted anti-Muslim agenda that first manifested in his 2017 Muslim travel ban is examined. “President Trump’s demands for “extreme vetting” require both draconian border security policies and continuous, automated surveillance of certain communities inside the United States, particularly Arab Americans and American Muslims,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICE &amp;amp; Technological Developments in Surveillance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Trump administration, the next innovation in surveillance is undoubtedly big data analytics. The monitoring of so-called &quot;persons of interest&quot;, of both those already within the U.S. and those seeking to immigrate, is becoming increasingly-automated. In May 2018, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposition to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to surveil immigrants was put aside after public outcry. By August, it had authorized the Visa Lifecycle Vetting Initiative (VLVI). Under this initiative, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaiusa.org/aai_issue_brief_surveillance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developing software&lt;/a&gt; to “determine and evaluate [via automation] an applicant’s probability of becoming a positively contributing member of society” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-iran-tensions-increase-social-media-surveillance-at-the-us-border/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;scraping information&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from social media profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government departments are working closely with private-sector tech companies, notably the secretive software firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-ice-explainer-data-startup-2019-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Palantir&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and Alex Karp. Palantir had once sold its products to military organizations to track crime and &quot;enemy activity&quot;. In 2018, despite protests from its employees, Palantir renewed its contracts with ICE, providing ICE with “investigative case management software” for building extensive databases used to monitor the undocumented immigrants who are being targeted by President Trump’s immigration crackdown, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijente.net/2019/05/02/palantir-arresting-families/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;separation of children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from their families at the border. Palantir’s databases are designed to quickly and accurately identify patterns and links in large swathes of data, which allows law enforcement officials to efficiently go from knowing one or two data points about a person to creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.de/palantir-ice-explainer-data-startup-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;highly-specific profile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of them – including photos, biometrics, vehicle information, phone records, criminal records, and police reports. Since Palantir began working with ICE, there has been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/palantir-directly-powers-ice-workplace-raids-emails-show/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sharp increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in arrests for civil immigration violations – 1,525 between October 2017 to 2018, compared to 172 in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping Intelligence in Check&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law by law, program by program, mass surveillance is eroding the democratic values and constitutional rights the U.S. was founded upon. “Take the effect of chilling speech, for instance,” notes Singh Guliani. “Certain studies have shown that, after the Snowden revelations, there were journalists who reported fear of talking about certain issues, as they were afraid that certain communications could be monitored. Further studies that have shown that individuals are less willing to say or search for things privately because they were worried about government monitoring. When we talk about privacy, there's privacy in the abstract, in the sense that it’s something we all want to have – that certain activities and things we do belong to us privately, and shouldn't be seen by other people – but there are also the broader effects too, like those on the values of free speech and democratic values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related question pertains to the democratic principle of equality under the law, given that not all people are equally impacted by surveillance activity. Singh Guliani explains, “We’ve seen that, historically, surveillance has often been targeted at certain communities – in the U.S., communities of color – and has often been used a tool to suppress the voices of critics and dissenters. For all of those reasons it's important to make sure we don't have a surveillance apparatus that isn't governed by clear laws, and isn't inconsistent with our Constitution and human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, can be done to keep the U.S. government and its intelligence efforts in check? “One of the things [the ACLU] has urged is laws that prohibit racial profiling, targeting based on protected status, religion, and First Amendment activities, including in a surveillance context,” Singh Guliani says. “We need to restrict the basis for which individuals can be targeted. At a top level, we need to make sure that there is transparency and oversight to prevent abuse. We also need to make sure individuals are notified – so they know when surveillance is happening, and if abuse does occur, they can raise legal challenges, or go to an independent court to enforce their rights. Surveillance needs an actual, factual basis grounded in probable cause, and it must be constrained by time and other limitations.” What it comes down to – and what the ACLU is working towards – in Singh Guliani’s words, is “clear guidance on targeted profiling to limit surveillance that occurs in those ways, as well as accountability mechanisms so that when abuse occurs we know about it and can take action.”&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/microsoft-customer-service-data-leak/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/microsoft-support-ss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-241728&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/microsoft-support-ss-1024x448.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;microsoft support ss&quot; width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;319&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the New Year, Microsoft exposed nearly 250 million Customer Service and Support (CSS) records on the web. The records contained logs of conversations between Microsoft support agents and customers from all over the world, spanning a 14-year period from 2005 to December 2019. All of the data was left accessible to anyone with a web browser, with no password or other authentication needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Comparitech security research team led by Bob Diachenko uncovered five Elasticsearch servers, each of which contained an apparently identical set of the 250 million records. Diachenko immediately notified Microsoft upon discovering the exposed data, and Microsoft took swift action to secure it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We’re thankful to Bob Diachenko for working closely with us so that we were able to quickly fix this misconfiguration, analyze data, and notify customers as appropriate.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Eric Doerr, General Manager, Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Timeline_of_the_exposure&quot;&gt;Timeline of the exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the data was exposed for about two days before we alerted Microsoft and the records were secured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;December 28, 2019 – The databases were indexed by search engine BinaryEdge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;December 29, 2019 – Diachenko discovered the databases and immediately notified Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;December 30-31, 2019 – Microsoft secured the servers and data. Diachenko and Microsoft continued the investigation and remediation process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan 21, 2020 – Microsoft disclosed additional details about the exposure as a result of the investigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I immediately reported this to Microsoft and within 24 hours all servers were secured,” Diachenko said. “I applaud the MS support team for responsiveness and quick turnaround on this despite New Year’s Eve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not know if any other unauthorized parties accessed the database during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;What_data_was_exposed&quot;&gt;What data was exposed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diachenko explains that most of the personally identifiable information—email aliases, contract numbers, and payment information—was redacted. However, many records contained plain text data, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customer email addresses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Descriptions of CSS claims and cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft support agent emails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case numbers, resolutions, and remarks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internal notes marked as “confidential”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Dangers_of_exposed_data_to_Microsoft_customers&quot;&gt;Dangers of exposed data to Microsoft customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/microsoft-support-2-ss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-241735&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/microsoft-support-2-ss.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;microsoft support 2 ss&quot; width=&quot;688&quot; height=&quot;283&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though most personally identifiable information was redacted from the records, the dangers of this exposure should not be underestimated. The data could be valuable to tech support scammers, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/tech-support-scams/&quot;&gt;Tech support scams&lt;/a&gt; entail a scammer contacting users and pretending to be a Microsoft support representative. These types of scams are quite prevalent, and even when scammers don’t have any personal information about their targets, they often impersonate Microsoft staff. Microsoft Windows is, after all, the most popular operating system in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed logs and case information in hand, scammers stand a better chance of succeeding against their targets. If scammers obtained the data before it was secured, they could exploit it by impersonating a real Microsoft employee and referring to a real case number. From there, they could phish for sensitive information or hijack user devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft customers and Windows users should be on the lookout for such scams via phone and email. Remember that Microsoft never proactively reaches out to users to solve their tech problems—users must approach Microsoft for help first. Microsoft employees will not ask for your password or request that you install remote desktop applications like TeamViewer. These are common tactics among tech scammers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Past_Microsoft_breaches_and_exposures&quot;&gt;Past Microsoft breaches and exposures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t Microsoft’s first data security incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, hackers broke into the company’s secret database for tracking bugs in its software. That breach didn’t include any user information and was never officially disclosed to the public, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-cyber-insight/exclusive-microsoft-responded-quietly-after-detecting-secret-database-hack-in-2013-idUSKBN1CM0D0&quot;&gt;Reuters confirmed the incident&lt;/a&gt; with five former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January and March 2019, hackers compromised the account of a Microsoft support agent. The company said there was a possibility that the hacker accessed the contents of some Outlook users’ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;How_and_why_we_discovered_this_exposure&quot;&gt;How and why we discovered this exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparitech collaborates with security researcher Bob Diachenko to find exposed databases on the web. Diachenko’s extensive cybersecurity experience allows us to quickly and responsibly disclose data breaches and exposures to responsible parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Diachenko discovers improperly secured data, he immediately takes steps to identify and notify the owner. Once the data has been secured, Comparitech publishes a report like this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigate the contents of the database to determine what information was exposed and to whom it belongs. Our goal is to mitigate harm to end users by limiting access to the data and raising awareness among those who might be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Previous_reports&quot;&gt;Previous reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparitech and Diachenko have worked together on a number of data incident reports affecting millions of people, including:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>I2C in a Nutshell</title>
<link>https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/i2c-in-a-nutshell</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/i2c-in-a-nutshell</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I2C is perhaps the most commonly used bus to connect ICs together. As such, firmware engineers encounter it on most projects. In this post, we explain how I2C works, explore common bugs and investigate how to debug these issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Interrupt? &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/gpRedv&quot;&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to get our latest posts straight to your mailbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;no_toc&quot; id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-use-i2c&quot;&gt;Why use I2C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C has many advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is cheaper to implement than comparable low-power buses, with fewer pins than SPI&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;, and a simpler physical layer than CAN&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt; (no differential signalling).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supports up to 127 devices on a bus with only two pins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has transfer rates up to 400Kbps, which is fast enough for many human interfaces as well as fan control, temperature sensing and other low-speed contol loops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historically, it has been less onerous for manufacturers to include than competing protocols like Maxim’s 1-wire protocol&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the sensors and actuators in devices all around us use i2c: temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, fans, video bridging chips, gpio expanders, EEPROMS, …etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C is not appropriate for all applications however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When higher bandwidth is required, SPI may be the right choice and can be found in many NOR-flash chips. MIPI can go even faster, and is often used in displays and cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If reliability is a must, CAN is the bus of choice. It is found in cars and other vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a single device is on the bus, UART may work just as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;anatomy-of-an-i2c-transaction&quot;&gt;Anatomy of an I2C transaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C is made up of two signals: a clock (SCL), and a data line (SDA). By default, the lines are pulled high by resistors. To communicate, a device pulls lines low and releases them to let them rise back to high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ones-and-zeroes&quot;&gt;Ones and Zeroes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a digital bus, I2C ultimately transmits 1s and 0s between two circuits. It does so using a very simple scheme: for pulse on the SCL line, one bit is sampled from the SDA line. For this to work properly, the SDA line must remain stable between the leading and falling edge of every SCL pulse. In other word, the value of the SDA line while the SCL line is high is the value of the transmitted bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xC9&lt;/code&gt; over I2C:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-and-stop&quot;&gt;Start and Stop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since an I2C bus may have multiple masters, there must be a way to signal that the bus is in use. This is accomplished with the START and STOP conditions. Every I2C command starts with a START condition and ends with a STOP condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send a START, an I2C master must pull the SDA line low while the SCL line is high. After a START condition, the I2C master must pull the SCL line low and start the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send a STOP, an I2C master releases the SDA line to high while the SCL line is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the diagram below, we indicate the START and STOP condition with “S” and “P” respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;addresses&quot;&gt;Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C is a multi-slave bus, so we must have a way to indicate which slave we would like to send a given command to. This is accomplished with addresses. I2C addresses are 7 bits, a few addresses are reserved and the rest are allocated by the I2C-bus committee. Note that a 10-bit address extension does exist, but is extremely uncommon&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To communicate with a slave device, an I2C master simply needs to write its 7-bit address on the bus after the START condition. For example, the waveform below captures an I2C transaction to a slave with address 0xC6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;: Since the I2C address space is so limited, address conflicts are not uncommon. For example, you may want to include multiple instances of the same sensor on a single I2C bus.&lt;br/&gt;To enable this use case IC designers typically allow their customers to set a few bits of a device’s I2C address, either by tying pins high or low, or by writing a register. If all else fails, you may use an I2C multiplexer to resolve addressing conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-and-writing&quot;&gt;Reading and Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C masters may read or write to slave devices. This is indicated with a single bit transmitted after the address bits. A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means the command is a read, and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means it is a write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example below shows a read sent to the slave device at address &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xC6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common pattern is to send a write followed by a read. For example, many devices expose several registers that can be read/written by first sending the register address to the device in with a write command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the I2C master must first send a write command with the register address, followed by a second START condition and a full read command (including the slave address).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this is what a write-then-read transaction to read register &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0x11&lt;/code&gt; from the slave device at address &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xC6&lt;/code&gt; would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I2C does not have a formal way for a slave device to send a command to a master device. Instead, most devices use an additional pin to signal to the master that it should get in touch. Typically, this ends up working like this: the slave device sets that GPIO to high, which raises an interrupt with the master device. The master device then reads a “interrupt source” register which indicates why the slave device raised the interrupt, and goes on to query the device for the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;acknack&quot;&gt;Ack/Nack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I2C protocol specifies that every byte sent must be acknowledged by the receiver. This is implemented with a single bit: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for ACK and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; for NACK. At the end of every byte, the transmitter releases the SDA line, and on the next clock cycle the receiver must pull the line low to acklowledged the byte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the line remains high during the next clock cycle, it is considered a NACK. This can mean one of several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A NACK after an address is sent means no slave responded to that address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A NACK after write data means the slave either did not recognize the command, or that it cannot accept any more data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A NACK during read data means the master does not want the slave to send any moe bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of a full I2C write command, with the ACK bits included. It writes &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0x9C&lt;/code&gt; to the slave at address &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xC6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/i2c-in-a-nutshell/full-i2c-command-narrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: A NACK is not necessarily an error condition, it sometimes can be used to end a read. For example, reading 8 bytes from an I2C EEPROM would be implemented by sending a write command to set the EEPROM address offset we want to read from, followed by command which would NACK the 8th byte to signal to the EEPROM device that no more bytes are needed. This is simpler than a hypothetical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clock-stretching&quot;&gt;Clock Stretching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While control of the SCL line is the domain of the I2C master, an optional feature of the protocol allows slaves to temporarily control it to slow down transmission before it is ready to accept more data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stretch the clock, the slave device simply holds the SCL line down. In that state, the master device must wait for the clock rises back up to high before resuming transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is sometimes a source of trouble: not every device supports it, and a master device with no support for clock stretching will hit errors if a slave device attempts to hold the clock down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugging-i2c&quot;&gt;Debugging I2C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I2C is a robust and simple protocol, firmware engineers find themslves debugging unresponsive devices on most projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following scenario: you just received a new board and are doing bringup. You’ve implemented a simple I2C transaction to read the chip ID of a slave device, but are getting back an error (or all 0s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through what could be going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;incompatible-devices&quot;&gt;Incompatible Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to check is that the master and slave devices are compatible with each other. While I2C is a standard, there are a couple of extensions to it which are not always implemented by every device on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we’ve seen two optional features which can lead to problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;400Kbps bus speed: the original I2C standard specified a bus speed of 100Kbps, but many modern devices support the optional 400Kbps mode. If your master device clocks data in at 400Kbps but your slave only supports 100Kbps, the slave may not respond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock stretching: clock stretching is an optional feature of the standard, and some slave devices do not support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check your datasheets, and if needed disable optional features on your master device. In doubt, slow the clock down to 100Kbps and disable clock stretching in firmware while configuring your I2C peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;misconfigured-peripherals&quot;&gt;Misconfigured Peripherals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you will want to grab a logic analyzer and probe the SDA and SCL signals. We’re partial to Saleae devices, which come with an easy to set up I2C decoder&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at a recording of those lines, you should see the SCL line pulse when data is being sent. You can set a trigger on a high to low transition of the clock line if that is easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the line stays permanently low, time to check the pull-ups (see the “Line Pull-Up” section below). If the lines stay high, the I2C peripheral in your MCU is likely misconfigured. Check the code again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you checking the return value of the I2C initialization and read/write functions? Some peripheral configurations are invalid and will emit errors. For example, a specific I2C peripheral may only be able to map to specific pins. Initializing it with the wrong pins will lead to an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your I2C init function being called? Connect your debugger and set a breakpoint in it. Make sure it completes properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all the necessary clocks enabled? I2C peripherals rely on specific PLLs or other clocks to generate their signal. Check your silicon vendor’s application notes and make sure you’ve got the right set of peripherals enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your logic analyzer trace looks like I2C traffic, time to dig deeper into addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i2c-address-issues&quot;&gt;I2C Address Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, you will see the following on your logic analyzer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An address is sent on the bus, but it is NACK-ed. Note that NACK is the default state of the lines, so often times it just means: nobody answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firt thing to check is: is the address correct? Your logic analyzer will often decode it as a byte, so you will need to shift it down by one bit to recover the 7-bit address. For example, 7-bit address 0x18 would show up as 0x30 in a byte with the lsb set to 0. Check that address against your device’s datasheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some devices have configurable addresses. Check your schematic to make sure configuration pins are pulled up or down as you would expect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, make sure you do not have address conflicts on your bus. Create a spreadsheet with the addresses of all the devices on the bus, and check for duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the address is correct and there are no duplicates, the problem is likely with the slave device. Go to “Slave device disabled or not working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;slave-device-disabled-or-not-working&quot;&gt;Slave device disabled or not working&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the address is correct but the slave device does not ACK it, it is likely not working properly. More often than not, this is because it is not powered or held in reset. Grab your voltmeter and start checking pins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the power supply of your slave device enabled? You may need to turn on a regulator or toggle a MOSFET.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the chip power the correct voltage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your slave device have a reset pin? Check that pin and make sure reset is not asserted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it have an I2C-enable pin? Is that in the correct state?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all the voltages are correct, test another board or replace the IC. Perhaps an electrostatic discharge damaged your device. If that does not resolve your issue, go to “Line Pull-Up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;line-pull-up&quot;&gt;Line Pull-Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C relies on resistors to pull the lines up to the logic HIGH voltage. These registers may be missing, have too high a resistance, or be connected to a rail at the wrong voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find it, grab an oscilloscope and probe both the SDA and SCL lines. First, set the oscilloscope in free-running mode and check the voltage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If it is consistently 0, pull-up resistors either are missing, or a device is holding the bus low. Check the layout, and verify the pullups are on the board. If they are, start removing I2C devices from the bus by depopulating them until the line rises back to high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is consistently high, devices are not attempting to communicate over I2C. See the “Misconfigured I2C Peripherals” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the voltage correct? Some devices operate at 5V, some at 3.3V, and some even at 1.8V. If a device is expecting a different voltage, it will need to be connected to the bus through a level translator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is toggling, set your oscilloscope to trigger on an edge, and look at the signal. It will likely look like one of these two scope shots shared on StackExchange &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/i2c-in-a-nutshell/weak-pull-ups.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/i2c-in-a-nutshell/strong-pull-ups.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how the second image has sharp, square pulses while the first image has rounded ones? This is your tell. Round pulses are an indications that your pull-ups are too weak. Your logic analyzer might decode them just fine, but an I2C device may have trouble with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I2C buses accumulate capacitances when traces are long and devices are added to the bus. You may need stronger pull-ups to overcome it. Counter intuitively, a strongr pull-up is a weaker resistor. In doubt, go to 2K resistors. You will waste a bit of power, but your I2C signal will look great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flowchart&quot;&gt;Flowchart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the process easier, we’ve put together a flowchart summarizing the I2C debugging process. You can find it below, or download it &lt;a href=&quot;https://interrupt.memfault.com/img/i2c-in-a-nutshell/i2c-debugging-flowchart.svg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing&quot;&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post gave you a useful overview of I2C, and how to debug misbehaving buses and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Wants Young People to Consider ‘Ethical Issues’ Before Taking Tech Jobs</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxenxx/mozilla-wants-young-people-to-consider-ethical-issues-before-taking-jobs-in-tech</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxenxx/mozilla-wants-young-people-to-consider-ethical-issues-before-taking-jobs-in-tech</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As tech companies like Google, GitHub, and Amazon clash with workers on a range of ethical issues, Mozilla has taken an unusual, if not unprecedented, stance on labor organizing for a major tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla Foundation, the non-profit arm of the company known for its privacy-friendly web browser Firefox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.mozilla.org/documents/58/Mozilla_Zine.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released a guide&lt;/a&gt; today for helping students navigate ethical issues in the tech industry, in particular, during the recruitment process. The guide advises students not to work for companies that build technology that harms vulnerable communities, and to educate themselves “on governance” inside companies before taking a job. It also discusses unions drives, walkouts, petitions, and other forms of worker organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide, which takes the form of a zine titled “With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility,” follows events hosted by the Mozilla Foundation last fall in partnership with six university campuses, including UC Berkeley, N.Y.U., M.I.T., Stanford, UC San Diego, and CU Boulder. Not so subtly, it calls out Amazon, Palantir, and Google, which have faced backlash in recent months &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb5wa3/firing-4-google-workers-is-illegal-retaliation-organizers-say?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from tech workers&lt;/a&gt; as well as students on the campuses where they recruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Addressing ethical issues in tech can be overwhelming for students interested in working in tech. But change in the industry is not impossible. And it is increasingly necessary,” reads the opening of the 11-page handbook—citing military contracts, algorithmic bias, inhumane working conditions in warehouses, biased facial recognition software, and intrusive data mining as causes for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla’s work with tech students arrives during a period of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/contributor/edward-ongweso-jr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heightened activism&lt;/a&gt; among students on universities campuses. In recent months, students at at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjdka/students-at-16-universities-are-protesting-palantirs-presence-on-campuses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;16 universities have protested&lt;/a&gt; their universities’ ties to the data analytics firm Palantir, which does business with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). (Palantir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailycal.org/2019/09/18/uc-berkeley-students-demand-tech-giant-palantir-drop-contracts-with-ice/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pays UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; at least $20,000 a year to recruit in its computer science and electrical engineering departments, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/11/21/students-join-nationwide-day-of-action-with-protest-against-university-involvement-with-palantir/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanford accepts&lt;/a&gt; $24,000.) Amazon—which does business with Palantir—has been another frequent target of campus protest. Other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epgnek/students-are-campaigning-to-ban-facial-recognition-from-college-campuses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;students are campaigning&lt;/a&gt; to ban facial recognition software on campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anu Raghunathan, a math and mechanical engineering major at New York University and chair of the university’s Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) chapter told Motherboard she was surprised by the Mozilla reception of an event she organized at NYU in October, where students and expert panelists discussed ethical AI, discrimination against women in tech, and algorithimic bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“Addressing ethical issues in tech can be overwhelming for students interested in working in tech. But change in the industry is not impossible. And it is increasingly necessary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of companies that offer recruiting events at NYU. Some students want to enter the private sector and work at some of these companies, others don’t. It’s an ongoing ideological battle,” said Raghunathan. “What surprised me about our event was that people showed up and were very engaged and concerned about ethical actions of tech companies. It was a very philosophical event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mozilla’s guide, tech workers offer advice to students compiled during these sessions for navigating the recruitment process—as well as a history of tech worker organizing, beginning in 1969 when the New York City collective &lt;a href=&quot;https://logicmag.io/play/joan-greenbaum-on-the-early-days-of-tech-worker-organizing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Computer People for Peace demanded&lt;/a&gt; the international computing society ACM denounce the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to create content that would address questions students might have before talking to a tech recruiter, and that included that tells the larger story of organizing in tech,” Ashley Boyd, Mozilla's vice president of Advocacy, told Motherboard. “We want students to know that it’s been happening for quite some time. That is to say, these efforts have taken shape before and will continue to be needed. Many of the questions we address are the perennial questions that workers face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before applying for jobs at large tech companies, the guide advises students to sit down with themselves and ask a long list of questions. Most of these questions focus on information flow throughout the company. (At many tech companies, engineers may not always be aware of how the technology they make is being implemented.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that Mozilla Corporation, which employs over 1,000 workers, announced last week that it is laying off 70 workers—raising questions about its own labor practices. When asked about the layoffs, Boyd referred Motherboard to Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/01/15/readying-for-the-future-at-mozilla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official statement&lt;/a&gt; on the matter. “We’re making a significant investment to fund innovation. In order to do that responsibly, we’ve also had to make some difficult choices which led to the elimination of roles at Mozilla which we announced internally today,” the announcement says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla’s recent work with college students comes out of an older campaign that began in 2016 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/internet-health/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create an internet strategy&lt;/a&gt; built on the pillars of openness, inclusion, and privacy. In 2018, that campaign began to specialize its focus on ethical implementations of artificial intelligence. In particular, Mozilla has sought to incorporate ethics curricula into computer science training programs. Between 2018 and 2020, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/01/15/readying-for-the-future-at-mozilla/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will devote up to $3.5 million in prizes&lt;/a&gt; to computer science departments that create promising models to embed ethics into computer sciences courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a tech worker or student organizing an action or protest? We'd love to hear from you. You can get in touch with Lauren via email lauren.gurley@vice.com or on Signal 201-897-2109.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been honing in on the topic of AI trustworthiness,” said Boyd. “So we began an initiative to build ethics into computer science training. At that point, we were hearing concerns from students getting ready to graduate about the recruitment process. [Last fall’s] events came out of the desire for a space for students to think about these questions and discuss how to leverage the power they have over tech companies as highly sought professionals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ethics are a big topic of discussion on campus and in science departments at Stanford,” Brooke Teferra, a fourth year mechanical engineering major and president of the club Computer Science for Social Good at Stanford, told Motherboard. Last October, Mozilla sponsored Teferra to speak about tech organizing at Stanford at MozFest, the company’s annual internet conference, in London. “We talked about what tech organizing looks like and how students are becoming more cognizant and the discussion is changing at Stanford. I didn’t know too much about Mozila before this. If they are doing what they say they’re doing, that’s incredible. It’s very easy to see companies set up these initiatives, but it’s not easy to implement them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd, Mozilla’s vice president of advocacy, said moving forward, the company plans to gauge the effectiveness of last year’s events with the hopes of hosting more events on college campuses this year.&lt;/p&gt;

He was kind, generous, supportive and passionate about living life to the full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian - writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other comedy figures paid tribute on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;social-embed&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;social-embed-post social-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote and starred in Monty Python's Flying Circus TV show and the comedy collective's films, as a range of much-loved characters. These included Arthur &quot;Two Sheds&quot; Jackson, Cardinal Biggles of the Spanish Inquisition and Mr Creosote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to directing The Holy Grail with Gilliam, Jones took sole directorial charge of 1979's Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleese said: &quot;Of his many achievements, for me the greatest gift he gave us all was his direction of Life of Brian. Perfection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Monty Python, he wrote the screenplay for the 1986 film Labyrinth, starring David Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

After university, they took part in various comedy shows before forming Monty Python with US-born animator Terry Gilliam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four series, the troupe moved to the big screen to make Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Python's Life of Brian, a controversial parody of Biblical epics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, their final film as a collective, returned to the original series' sketch-based format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surviving members reunited periodically after Chapman's death in 1989, most notably for a run of live shows at the O2 in London in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The initial symptoms are, in most cases, changes in behaviour, mental ability and language, which will get worse over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Language problems can include loss of vocabulary, repetition and forgetting the meaning of common words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;FTD  is caused by abnormal protein clumps forming inside the brain cells, which are thought to damage the cells and stop them working. Why this happens is not fully understood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Although there are currently no cures or treatments to slow FTD down, there are treatments that can help control some symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
