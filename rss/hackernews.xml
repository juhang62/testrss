Abstract

   In order to easily distinguish between multiple computers, we give
   them names.  Experience has taught us that it is as easy to choose
   bad names as it is to choose good ones.  This essay presents
   guidelines for deciding what makes a name good or bad.

   Keywords: domain name system, naming conventions, computer
   administration, computer network management

Introduction

   As soon as you deal with more than one computer, you need to
   distinguish between them.  For example, to tell your system
   administrator that your computer is busted, you might say, &quot;Hey Ken.
   Goon is down!&quot;

   Computers also have to be able to distinguish between themselves.
   Thus, when sending mail to a colleague at another computer, you might
   use the command &quot;mail libes@goon&quot;.

   In both cases, &quot;goon&quot; refers to a particular computer.  How the name
   is actually dereferenced by a human or computer need not concern us
   here.  This essay is only concerned with choosing a &quot;good&quot; name.  (It
   is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of the domain
   name system as described by [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178#ref-2&quot; title=&quot;&amp;quot;Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].)

   By picking a &quot;good&quot; name for your computer, you can avoid a number of
   problems that people stumble over again and again.

   Here are some guidelines on what NOT to do.

&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


      Don't overload other terms already in common use.

         Using a word that has strong semantic implications in the
         current context will cause confusion.  This is especially true
         in conversation where punctuation is not obvious and grammar is
         often incorrect.

         For example, a distributed database had been built on top of
         several computers.  Each one had a different name.  One machine
         was named &quot;up&quot;, as it was the only one that accepted updates.
         Conversations would sound like this: &quot;Is up down?&quot;  and &quot;Boot
         the machine up.&quot; followed by &quot;Which machine?&quot;

         While it didn't take long to catch on and get used to this
         zaniness, it was annoying when occasionally your mind would
         stumble, and you would have to stop and think about each word
         in a sentence.  It is as if, all of a sudden, English has
         become a foreign language.

      Don't choose a name after a project unique to that machine.

         A manufacturing project had named a machine &quot;shop&quot; since it was
         going to be used to control a number of machines on a shop
         floor.  A while later, a new machine was acquired to help with
         some of the processing.  Needless to say, it couldn't be called
         &quot;shop&quot; as well.  Indeed, both machines ended up performing more
         specific tasks, allowing more precision in naming.  A year
         later, five new machines were installed and the original one
         was moved to an unrelated project.  It is simply impossible to
         choose generic names that remain appropriate for very long.

         Of course, they could have called the second one &quot;shop2&quot; and so
         on.  But then one is really only distinguishing machines by
         their number.  You might as well just call them &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and
         &quot;3&quot;.  The only time this kind of naming scheme is appropriate
         is when you have a lot of machines and there are no reasons for
         any human to distinguish between them.  For example, a master
         computer might be controlling an array of one hundred
         computers.  In this case, it makes sense to refer to them with
         the array indices.

         While computers aren't quite analogous to people, their names
         are.  Nobody expects to learn much about a person by their
         name.  Just because a person is named &quot;Don&quot; doesn't mean he is
         the ruler of the world (despite what the &quot;Choosing a Name for
         your Baby&quot; books say).  In reality, names are just arbitrary
         tags.  You cannot tell what a person does for a living, what
         their hobbies are, and so on.



&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Libes                                                           [Page 2]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


      Don't use your own name.

         Even if a computer is sitting on your desktop, it is a mistake
         to name it after yourself.  This is another case of
         overloading, in which statements become ambiguous.  Does &quot;give
         the disk drive to don&quot; refer to a person or computer?

         Even using your initials (or some other moniker) is
         unsatisfactory.  What happens if I get a different machine
         after a year?  Someone else gets stuck with &quot;don&quot; and I end up
         living with &quot;jim&quot;.  The machines can be renamed, but that is
         excess work and besides, a program that used a special
         peripheral or database on &quot;don&quot; would start failing when it
         wasn't found on the &quot;new don&quot;.

         It is especially tempting to name your first computer after
         yourself, but think about it.  Do you name any of your other
         possessions after yourself?  No.  Your dog has its own name, as
         do your children.  If you are one of those who feel so inclined
         to name your car and other objects, you certainly don't reuse
         your own name.  Otherwise you would have a great deal of
         trouble distinguishing between them in speech.

         For the same reason, it follows that naming your computer the
         same thing as your car or another possession is a mistake.

      Don't use long names.

         This is hard to quantify, but experience has shown that names
         longer than eight characters simply annoy people.

         Most systems will allow prespecified abbreviations, but why not
         choose a name that you don't have to abbreviate to begin with?
         This removes any chance of confusion.

      Avoid alternate spellings.

         Once we called a machine &quot;czek&quot;.  In discussion, people
         continually thought we were talking about a machine called
         &quot;check&quot;.  Indeed, &quot;czek&quot; isn't even a word (although &quot;Czech&quot;
         is).

         Purposely incorrect (but cute) spellings also tend to annoy a
         large subset of people.  Also, people who have learned English
         as a second language often question their own knowledge upon
         seeing a word that they know but spelled differently.  (&quot;I
         guess I've always been spelling &quot;funxion&quot; incorrectly.  How
         embarrassing!&quot;)



&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Libes                                                           [Page 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


         By now you may be saying to yourself, &quot;This is all very
         silly...people who have to know how to spell a name will learn
         it and that's that.&quot; While it is true that some people will
         learn the spelling, it will eventually cause problems
         somewhere.

         For example, one day a machine named &quot;pythagoris&quot; (sic) went
         awry and began sending a tremendous number of messages to the
         site administrator's computer.  The administrator, who wasn't a
         very good speller to begin with, had never seen this machine
         before (someone else had set it up and named it), but he had to
         deal with it since it was clogging up the network as well as
         bogging down his own machine which was logging all the errors.
         Needless to say, he had to look it up every time he needed to
         spell &quot;pythagoris&quot;.  (He suspected there was an abbreviation,
         but he would have had to log into yet another computer (the
         local nameserver) to find out and the network was too jammed to
         waste time doing that.)

      Avoid domain names.

         For technical reasons, domain names should be avoided.  In
         particular, name resolution of non-absolute hostnames is
         problematic.  Resolvers will check names against domains before
         checking them against hostnames.  But we have seen instances of
         mailers that refuse to treat single token names as domains.
         For example, assume that you mail to &quot;libes@rutgers&quot; from
         yale.edu.  Depending upon the implementation, the mail may go
         to rutgers.edu or rutgers.yale.edu (assuming both exist).

      Avoid domain-like names.

         Domain names are either organizational (e.g., cia.gov) or
         geographical (e.g., dallas.tx.us).  Using anything like these
         tends to imply some connection.  For example, the name &quot;tahiti&quot;
         sounds like it means you are located there.  This is confusing
         if it is really somewhere else (e.g., &quot;tahiti.cia.gov is
         located in Langley, Virginia?  I thought it was the CIA's
         Tahiti office!&quot;).  If it really is located there, the name
         implies that it is the only computer there.  If this isn't
         wrong now, it inevitably will be.

         There are some organizational and geographical names that work
         fine.  These are exactly the ones that do not function well as
         domain names.  For example, amorphous names such as rivers,
         mythological places and other impossibilities are very
         suitable.  (&quot;earth&quot; is not yet a domain name.)




&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Libes                                                           [Page 4]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


      Don't use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names.

         Words like &quot;moron&quot; or &quot;twit&quot; are good names if no one else is
         going to see them.  But if you ever give someone a demo on your
         machine, you may find that they are distracted by seeing a
         nasty word on your screen.  (Maybe their spouse called them
         that this morning.)  Why bother taking the chance that they
         will be turned off by something completely irrelevant to your
         demo.

      Don't use digits at the beginning of the name.

         Many programs accept a numerical internet address as well as a
         name.  Unfortunately, some programs do not correctly
         distinguish between the two and may be fooled, for example, by
         a string beginning with a decimal digit.

         Names consisting entirely of hexadecimal digits, such as
         &quot;beef&quot;, are also problematic, since they can be interpreted
         entirely as hexadecimal numbers as well as alphabetic strings.

      Don't use non-alphanumeric characters in a name.

         Your own computer may handle punctuation or control characters
         in a name, but most others do not.  If you ever expect to
         connect your computer to a heterogeneous network, you can count
         on a variety of interpretations of non-alphanumeric characters
         in names.  Network conventions on this are surprisingly
         nonstandard.

      Don't expect case to be preserved.

         Upper and lowercase characters look the same to a great deal of
         internet software, often under the assumption that it is doing
         you a favor.  It may seem appropriate to capitalize a name the
         same way you might do it in English, but convention dictates
         that computer names appear all lowercase.  (And it saves
         holding down the shift key.)

   Now that we've heard what not to do, here are some suggestions on
   names that work well.

      Use words/names that are rarely used.

         While a word like &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;up&quot; (see above) isn't computer
         jargon, it is just too likely to arise in discussion and throw
         off one's concentration while determining the correct referent.
         Instead, use words like &quot;lurch&quot; or &quot;squire&quot; which are unlikely



&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Libes                                                           [Page 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


         to cause any confusion.

         You might feel it is safe to use the name &quot;jose&quot; just because
         no one is named that in your group, but you will have a problem
         if you should happen to hire Jose.  A name like &quot;sphinx&quot; will
         be less likely to conflict with new hires.

      Use theme names.

         Naming groups of machines in a common way is very popular, and
         enhances communality while displaying depth of knowledge as
         well as imagination.  A simple example is to use colors, such
         as &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;.  Personality can be injected by choices
         such as &quot;aqua&quot; and &quot;crimson&quot;.

         Certain sets are finite, such as the seven dwarfs.  When you
         order your first seven computers, keep in mind that you will
         probably get more next year.  Colors will never run out.

         Some more suggestions are: mythical places (e.g., Midgard,
         Styx, Paradise), mythical people (e.g., Procne, Tereus, Zeus),
         killers (e.g., Cain, Burr, Boleyn), babies (e.g., colt, puppy,
         tadpole, elver), collectives (e.g., passel, plague, bevy,
         covey), elements (e.g., helium, argon, zinc), flowers (e.g.,
         tulip, peony, lilac, arbutus).  Get the idea?

      Use real words.

         Random strings are inappropriate for the same reason that they
         are so useful for passwords.  They are hard to remember.  Use
         real words.

      Don't worry about reusing someone else's hostname.

         Extremely well-known hostnames such as &quot;sri-nic&quot; and &quot;uunet&quot;
         should be avoided since they are understood in conversation as
         absolute addresses even without a domain.  In all other cases,
         the local domain is assumed to qualify single-part hostnames.
         This is similar to the way phone numbers are qualified by an
         area code when dialed from another area.

         In other words, if you have choosen a reasonable name, you do
         not have to worry that it has already been used in another
         domain.  The number of hosts in a bottom-level domain is small,
         so it shouldn't be hard to pick a name unique only to that
         domain.





&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Libes                                                           [Page 6]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;noprint&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;newpage&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178&quot;&gt;RFC 1178&lt;/a&gt;                   Name Your Computer                August 1990&lt;/span&gt;


      There is always room for an exception.

         I don't think any explanation is needed here.  However, let me
         add that if you later decide to change a name (to something
         sensible like you should have chosen in the first place), you
         are going to be amazed at the amount of pain awaiting you.  No
         matter how easy the manuals suggest it is to change a name, you
         will find that lots of obscure software has rapidly accumulated
         which refers to that computer using that now-ugly name.  It all
         has to be found and changed.  People mailing to you from other
         sites have to be told.  And you will have to remember that
         names on old backup media labels correspond to different names.

         I could go on but it would be easier just to forget this
         guideline exists.

Conclusion

   Most people don't have the opportunity to name more than one or two
   computers, while site administrators name large numbers of them.  By
   choosing a name wisely, both user and administrator will have an
   easier time of remembering, discussing and typing the names of their
   computers.

   I have tried to formalize useful guidelines for naming computers,
   along with plenty of examples to make my points obvious.  Having been
   both a user and site administrator, many of these anecdotes come from
   real experiences which I have no desire to relive.  Hopefully, you
   will avoid all of the pitfalls I have discussed by choosing your
   computer's name wisely.

<description>&lt;h4 data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;Transparent access to remote resource on a private network&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let's say there's a git repository on a private network that's only accessible through a private server on the network. This server is not accessible to the public internet. You have direct access to the server, but don't have VPN access to the private network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;flow-diagram&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;private-server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;git@private-network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;For convenience, you'd like to access this private git repository as if you were connecting to it directly from your local system. If you have SSH access to another server that's accessible from both your local system and the private server, you can accomplish this by establishing an SSH tunnel and using a couple of ProxyCommand directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;ssh -L 127.0.0.1:22:127.0.0.1:2222 intermediate-host&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;div data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;flow-diagram&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;127.0.0.1:2222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;127.0.0.1:22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;This forwards port 2222 on intermediate-host to port 22 on the private server. Now, if you SSH to port 2222 from intermediate-host, you're connecting to the SSH server on the private server despite the private server not being accessible by the public internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;ssh -p 2222 user@localhost&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you'd like to make the backdoor even more convenient, you can add some directives to your local ~/.ssh/config&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Host git.private.network&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  HostName git.private.network&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  ForwardAgent yes&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  ProxyCommand ssh private nc %h %p&lt;p&gt;Host private&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  HostName localhost&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  Port 2222&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  User private-user&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  ForwardAgent yes&lt;br data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
  ProxyCommand ssh tunnel@intermediate-host nc %h %p&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;div data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;flow-diagram&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;127.0.0.1:2222&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;127.0.0.1:22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-v-01c96d82=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now you have access to the private git repository as if you were on the private network.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;
A flower is visible behind a piece of the transparent material. (Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;107.62114989733&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at the University of Maryland have turned ordinary sheets of wood into &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;transparent material&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that is nearly as clear as glass, but stronger and with better insulating properties. It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;inread-wrapper-id-84530372&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent. (Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened. This made the white wood transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface. The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through. The result is a long piece of what looks like glass, with the strength and flexibility of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;A researcher holds up a square of transparent wood material against a green leaf. (USDA Forest Service)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As window material, it would be much more resistant to accidental breakage. The clear wood is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this technology has yet to  be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…&lt;/p&gt;

The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: &lt;strong&gt;virtualization,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;concurrency,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;persistence.&lt;/strong&gt; In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. Lots of fun stuff! Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-522ded6304485cdac723f25d03c012dd_1200x500.jpg&quot;&gt;maybe not&lt;/a&gt; so fun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercookie&lt;/strong&gt; uses favicons to assign a unique identifier to website visitors.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike traditional tracking methods, this ID can be stored almost persistently and cannot be easily cleared by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tracking method works even in the browser's incognito mode and is not cleared by flushing the cache, closing the browser or restarting the system, using a VPN or installing AdBlockers. 🍿 &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercookie.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Live demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercookie.me/workwise#content-background&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;📖 Background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern browsers offer a wide range of features to improve and simplify the user experience. One of these features are the so-called favicons: A favicon is a small (usually 16×16 or 32×32 pixels) logo used by web browsers to brand a website in a recognizable way. Favicons are usually shown by most browsers in the address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To serve a favicon on their website, a developer has to include an attribute in the webpage’s header. If this tag does exist, the browser requests the icon from the predefined source and if the server response contains an valid icon file that can be properly rendered this icon is displayed by the browser. In any other case, a blank favicon is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-html-basic&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-kos&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;/favicon.ico&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;image/x-icon&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-kos&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The favicons must be made very easily accessible by the browser. Therefore, they are cached in a separate local database on the system, called the favicon cache (F-Cache). A F-Cache data entries includes the visited URL (subdomain, domain, route, URL paramter), the favicon ID and the time to live (TTL). While this provides web developers the ability to delineate parts of their website using a wide variety of icons for individual routes and subdomains, it also leads to a possible tracking scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user visits a website, the browser checks if a favicon is needed by looking up the source of the shortcut icon link reference of the requested webpage. The browser initialy checks the local F-cache for an entry containing the URL of the active website. If a favicon entry exists, the icon will be loaded from the cache and then displayed. However, if there is no entry, for example because no favicon has ever been loaded under this particular domain, or the data in the cache is out of date, the browser makes a GET request to the server to load the site's favicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://supercookie.me/workwise#content-threat-model&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;💣 Threat Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article a possible threat model is explained that allows to assign a unique identifier to each browser in order to draw conclusions about the user and to be able to identify this user even in case of applied anti-fingerprint measures, such as the use of a VPN, deletion of cookies, deletion of the browser cache or manipulation of the client header information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web server can draw conclusions about whether a browser has already loaded a favicon or not: So when the browser requests a web page, if the favicon is not in the local F-cache, another request for the favicon is made. If the icon already exists in the F-Cache, no further request is sent. By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client. When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By varying the number of bits that corresponds to the number of redirects to subpaths, this attack can be scaled almost arbitrarily. It can distinguish 2^N unique users, where N is the number of redirects on the client side. The time taken for the read and write operation increases as the number of distinguishable clients does.&lt;br/&gt;In order to keep the number of redirects as minimal as possible, N can have a dynamic length. More about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://supercookie.me/workwise#content-scalability-performance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pre-built images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo releases are available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano/releases&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These releases are designed to be run in VirtualBox, though QEMU is also supported. 2GB of RAM, a virtio-net NIC and an Intel HDA audio controller are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building from source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the MBuild repo: (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/froggey/MBuild&quot;&gt;https://github.com/froggey/MBuild&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;In the US, Starbucks started selling Impossible breakfast sandwiches, as did Burger King, while KFC began a new trial of Beyond Fried Chicken. Impossible got into Walmart, and Beyond Meat into Sam’s Club, with the brands now available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fooddive.com/news/with-more-retail-expansions-plant-based-meat-gets-closer-to-ubiquity/582813/&quot;&gt;9K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fooddive.com/news/with-more-retail-expansions-plant-based-meat-gets-closer-to-ubiquity/582813/&quot;&gt;25K&lt;/a&gt; respectively of the US’ roughly 40K grocery stores. US retail plant-based meat sales continued to average about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meatingplace.com/Industry/AnalogueDish/Details/92534&quot;&gt;40-50%&lt;/a&gt; above last year, putting them on track to surpass $1B in retail sales this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As a result, plant-based meat is becoming ever-more widespread and convenient. But it’s still not competing with traditional meat on one key attribute: price. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Price Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The average price for meat alternatives sold in US grocers’ meat departments last year was &lt;a href=&quot;https://progressivegrocer.com/2020-retail-meat-review-robust-sales-plant-based-products-gaining-ground&quot;&gt;$9.87/lb&lt;/a&gt;, twice the average price of beef ($4.82/lb), and fourfold the average price of chicken ($2.33/lb). Frozen meat alternatives are a bit cheaper, most recently averaging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meatingplace.com/Industry/AnalogueDish/Details/92534&quot;&gt;$6.60/lb&lt;/a&gt;, but that only puts them on par with veal ($6.67lb).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects plant-based meat’s positioning as a premium product. It’s exciting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meatingplace.com/Industry/AnalogueDish/Details/92534&quot;&gt;4-5%&lt;/a&gt; of US supermarkets’ refrigerated meat product lines are now plant-based, given plant-based still accounts for only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meatingplace.com/Industry/AnalogueDish/Details/92534&quot;&gt;0.3-.4%&lt;/a&gt; of meat sales by volume. But supermarkets likely only tolerate this discrepancy because they can charge a bigger markup on plant-based products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This price imbalance may matter more than ever in the coming years. With an impending global financial recession, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/3/ca9509en/CA9509EN.pdf&quot;&gt;FAO&lt;/a&gt; predicts that global meat prices will continue to fall, and only the cheapest meat — poultry — will continue to grow its production this year. (More happily, the FAO predicts total pork and beef production will fall for the first time in years.) So what can we do to help plant-based meat compete on price with ever-cheaper meat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wisdom of the Old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Startups, led by Beyond and Impossible, have revolutionized plant-based meat with their innovations in taste and marketing. US plant-based meat retail sales rose by just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iriworldwide.com/IRI/media/Library/webinar/Fresh-Meat.pdf&quot;&gt;1-3%&lt;/a&gt; annually from 2013 to 2016, the year when both the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger went on sale. Since then, US plant-based meat retail sales have grown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch&quot;&gt;16-18%&lt;/a&gt; per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But established plant-based companies may have more to teach us on price. The two best-selling plant-based meat brands in US retail last year were Morningstar and Gardein, founded in 1975 and 2003, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/347935/plant-based-foods-price-cutting-amid-product-prol.html&quot;&gt;25%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/347935/plant-based-foods-price-cutting-amid-product-prol.html&quot;&gt;15%&lt;/a&gt; of sales respectively. Along with Lightlife and BOCA, both founded in 1979, these four brands also have the lowest prices (see graph above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do these established companies achieve lower prices? One factor probably isn’t worth replicating: Morningstar, Gardein, and BOCA sell almost exclusively frozen products. Supermarkets typically mark frozen products up less than refrigerated ones, on which retailers charge a premium to offset increased spoilage. But this may limit the products’ potential, given a recent PBFA-Kroger &lt;a href=&quot;https://plantbasedfoods.org/marketplace/pbfa-and-kroger-plant-based-meat-study/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that plant-based meat sells better in the (refrigerated) meat section, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://progressivegrocer.com/2020-retail-meat-review-robust-sales-plant-based-products-gaining-ground&quot;&gt;67%&lt;/a&gt; of US supermarkets now say they sell at least some meat alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other factors behind the established companies’ lower prices may hold more promise: a focus on cheap ingredients and production efficiency.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap Inputs, Cheap Outputs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One of the biggest trends in plant-based meat is toward novel proteins, like mung beans, potatoes, fava beans, chickpeas, lentils, oats, lupine, and faba. This is exciting: some of these proteins may offer functional and environmental benefits. But there’s a risk to the whole industry moving in this direction — as some insiders have suggested to me it may.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the low price of conventional chicken can be explained by the industry’s reliance on just three crops — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poultryhub.org/nutrition/feed-ingredients/&quot;&gt;corn, wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unitedsoybean.org/wp-content/uploads/meal-animal-mitchell.pdf&quot;&gt;soy&lt;/a&gt; — which currently sell for just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=corn&amp;amp;months=60&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=soybeans&quot;&gt;15 cents/lb&lt;/a&gt;. Morningstar, Gardein, BOCA, and Lightlife also rely primarily on two of those crops, in the form of vital wheat gluten, and soy protein concentrate and isolate. These crop byproducts are slightly pricier than chicken feed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Free-sample-whole-vital-wheat-flour_60654831473.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.17.3a9b3465vqU1vN&amp;amp;s=p&amp;amp;fullFirstScreen=true&quot;&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/concentrate-soy-protein-soy-protein-extraction_62528081546.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.63.49c95711q0nlo2&quot;&gt;selling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-Quality-Soy-Protein-Isolate_431332858.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.2.7c6f1903bO7pGC&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; bulk for around 50 cents/lb on Alibaba, though companies don’t have to feed them through a chicken first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel proteins are much pricier.

Slightly less novel pea protein is cheaper, starting at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Pea-Protein-Isolate-Pea-Protein-Isolate_62258638051.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.2.2ea14691wvktik&amp;amp;s=p&quot;&gt;$1/lb&lt;/a&gt;, though the non-GMO and organic varieties preferred by many startups are pricier. And most of these are already large-scale crops, so it may be hard to bring prices down a lot further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry insiders justify the move to novel proteins based largely on a belief that consumers dislike soy and wheat protein. They point, for instance, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fooddive.com/news/how-free-from-foods-are-changing-manufacturing/532089/&quot;&gt;rapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodbeverageinsider.com/market-trends-analysis/gluten-free-foods-fueled-clean-label-plant-protein-ancient-grains&quot;&gt;growth&lt;/a&gt; in “soy-free” and “gluten-free” US product claims. But are consumer beliefs strong enough to justify the cost hit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, unpublished, Rethink Priorities survey investigated this claim. They found that slightly more Americans said they’d eat pea-based meat replacements than soy or wheat-based versions. But even more said they’d eat generic “plant-based” meat replacements, which may just show the perils of specificity — why the chicken industry doesn’t market its product as “GMO soy-fed chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor is it obvious that US stigmas around gluten and soy apply to larger global markets. A 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plantandfood.co.nz/file/protein-china-perspective.pdf&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of 2,000 Chinese consumers found they were just as interested in trying “mock meats” made of wheat or soy as of mycoprotein or potato protein. And, as of 2017, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://euvepro.eu/_library/_files/INNOVA_2018_report_slides_-_THE_USE_OF_PLANT-BASED_PROTEINS_IN_FOOD_AND_BEVERAGES_IN_THE_EU(1).pdf&quot;&gt;vast majority&lt;/a&gt; of new European plant-based meats were based on soy and wheat protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale and Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A related lesson is to focus on scaling relatively simple products. Morningstar, Gardein, Lightlife, and BOCA share another trait — they’re all owned by huge food conglomerates: Kellogg, ConAgra, Kraft Heinz, and Maple Leaf Foods respectively. This enables them to draw on their parent companies’ scale in manufacturing and distribution, and to focus mostly on the simple, processed products, like patties and nuggets, that these conglomerates know best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, many startups focus on replicating novel products that their typically vegan founders miss: from steaks to fancy cheeses. For many, this focus on white space makes sense as a way to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. But the focus on novelty often causes them to rely for scale on contract manufacturers, who process their products with inconsistent quality and a consistent markup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebellyous Foods is a notable exception. It’s pursuing just one simple product, plant-based chicken nuggets, and focusing on streamlining and scaling its production process. As its founder Christie Lagally &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/get-rebellyous/the-alt-meat-movement-enters-phase-2-fc6c2dafcfa9&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, most plant-based manufacturing relies on off-the-shelf equipment never intended for this use, limiting production speed and quality, and requiring skilled technicians to make frequent repairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In focusing on production efficiency, Rebellyous is &lt;a href=&quot;https://agfundernews.com/the-plant-based-meat-revolution-is-not-inevitable.html&quot;&gt;pursuing&lt;/a&gt; the strategy the chicken industry used to achieve its current global dominance. Since the 1930s the chicken industry has done little product innovation — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/12/robert-c-baker-the-man-who-invented-chicken-nuggets.html&quot;&gt;invention of McNuggets&lt;/a&gt; is still its proudest accomplishment. But it has lowered the price of chicken several fold by relentlessly cutting costs and breeding for feed efficiency (at great expense to the birds’ welfare).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond and Impossible seem to be applying these lessons. Both have stuck to just a few products and invested in their own manufacturing plants. Beyond appears to have cut its cost of production from about $4.50/lb when it listed last year to $3.50/lb today (calculated based on dividing its production volume by its cost of goods sold in its most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.beyondmeat.com/static-files/c64b8df4-85bd-4a48-821d-da3dcda7f77a&quot;&gt;SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;). And Impossible &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/impossible-foods/how-our-commitment-to-consumers-and-our-planet-led-us-to-use-gm-soy-23f880c93408&quot;&gt;switched&lt;/a&gt; to GMO soy last year — earning it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/blog/5628/our-beef-with-the-gmo-impossible-burger?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxNGznsyU6wIVAz2tBh0NYw9cEAAYASAAEgKqQvD_BwE&quot;&gt;enmity&lt;/a&gt; of anti-GMO groups — likely mainly to cut its ingredient costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world’s three largest meat companies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-launches-its-take-on-alternative-proteins-with-new-raised-rooted-brand/&quot;&gt;Tyson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fooddive.com/news/jbs-enters-crowded-plant-based-segment-with-ozo-brand/573412/&quot;&gt;JBS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fooddive.com/news/cargill-enters-plant-based-meat-with-burgers-and-ground-products/572805/&quot;&gt;Cargill&lt;/a&gt;, expand their plant-based offerings, there should be even more focus on scale and cost. Startups will likely continue to drive the most exciting innovations in the space. But we’ll need both that innovation and the big players’ relentless focus on efficiency and scale to make plant-based meat not just the right option, but the tastier and cheaper one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Feb 6, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an &lt;code&gt;ARCHITECTURE&lt;/code&gt; document next to &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING&lt;/code&gt;. Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another “docs are good, write more docs” advice. I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, eg, I often use just “simplify” as a commit message. Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experience with both contributing to and maintaining open-source projects. One of the lessons I’ve learned is that the biggest difference between an occasional contributor and a core developer lies in the knowledge about the physical architecture of the project. Roughly, it takes 2x more time to write a patch if you are unfamiliar with the project, but it takes 10x more time to figure out &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; you should change the code. This difference might be hard to perceive if you’ve been working with the project for a while. If I am new to a code base, I read each file as a sequence of logical chunks specified in some pseudo-random order. If I’ve made significant contributions before, the perception is quite different. I have a mental map of the code in my head, so I no longer read sequentially. Instead, I just jump to where the thing should be, and, if it is not there, I move it. Mental map is the source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;code&gt;ARCHITECTURE&lt;/code&gt; file to be a low-effort high-leverage way to bridge this gap. As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule of thumb for &lt;code&gt;ARCHITECTURE&lt;/code&gt; — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change. Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a bird’s eye overview of the problem being solved. Then, specify a more-or-less detailed codemap. Describe coarse-grained modules and how they relate to each other. Codemap should answer “where’s the thing that does X?”. It should also answer “what does the thing that I am looking at do?”. Avoid going into details of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; each module works, pull this into separate documents or (better) inline documentation. Codemap is a map of a country, and not an atlas of maps of its states. Use this as a chance to reflect on the project structure. Are the things you want to put near each other in the codemap adjacent in &lt;code&gt;exa -TD&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do name important files, modules, and types. Do not directly link them (links go stale). Instead, encourage the reader to use symbol search to find the mentioned entities by name. This doesn’t require maintenance, and will help to discover related, similarly named things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly call-out architectural invariants. Often, important invariants are expressed as an &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of something, and it’s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code. Nothing in the model layer specifically doesn’t depend on the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point out boundaries between layers and systems as well. A boundary implicitly contains information about the implementation of the system behind it. It even constraints all &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; implementations. But finding a boundary by just randomly looking at the code is hard — good boundaries have measure zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing the codemap, add a separate section on cross-cutting concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;5.7931034482759&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of &lt;code&gt;ARCHITECTURE&lt;/code&gt; document is the one from rust-analyzer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/d7c99931d05e3723d878bea5dc26766791fa4e69/docs/dev/architecture.md&quot;&gt;architecture.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
