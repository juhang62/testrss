<description>&lt;hr class=&quot;mt-4 mb-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;mb-4 pb-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;badge badge-secondary&quot;&gt;Published&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;published mr-3&quot;&gt;25 Jan 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;badge badge-secondary&quot;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;mr-3&quot; href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org&quot;&gt;The Apache Arrow PMC (pmc)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 3.0.0 release. This covers over 3 months of development work and includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ARROW%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;666 resolved issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/release/3.0.0.html#contributors&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;106 distinct contributors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. See the Install Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/release/3.0.0.html&quot;&gt;complete changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;columnar-format-notes&quot;&gt;Columnar Format Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decimal256 data type, which was already supported by the Arrow columnar format specification, is now implemented in C++ and Java (ARROW-9747).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrow-flight-rpc-notes&quot;&gt;Arrow Flight RPC notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication in C++/Java/Python has been overhauled, allowing more flexible authentication methods and use of standard headers. Support for cookies has also been added. The C++/Java implementations are now more permissive when parsing messages in order to interoperate better with other Flight implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic Flight implementation for C#/.NET has been added. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html#flight-rpc&quot;&gt;implementation status matrix&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-notes&quot;&gt;C++ notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default memory pool can now be changed at runtime using the environment variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ARROW_DEFAULT_MEMORY_POOL&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-11009). The environment variable is inspected at process startup. This is useful when trying to diagnose memory consumption issues with Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STL-like iterators are now provided over concrete arrays. Those are useful for non-performance critical tasks, for example testing (ARROW-10776).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to concatenate dictionary arrays with unequal dictionaries. The dictionaries are unified when concatenating, for supported data types (ARROW-5336).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads in a thread pool are now spawned lazily as needed for enqueued tasks, up to the configured capacity. They used to be spawned upfront on creation of the thread pool (ARROW-10038).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compute-layer&quot;&gt;Compute layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive documentation for compute functions is now available: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute functions for string processing have been added for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;splitting on whitespace (ASCII and Unicode flavors) and splitting on a pattern (ARROW-9991);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trimming characters (ARROW-9128).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index_in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is_in&lt;/code&gt; compute functions with nulls has been changed for consistency (ARROW-10663).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple-column sort kernels are now available for tables and record batches (ARROW-8199, ARROW-10796, ARROW-10790).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of table filtering has been vastly improved (ARROW-10569).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalar arguments are now accepted for more compute functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute functions &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quantile&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-10831) and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is_nan&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-11043) have been added for numeric data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation functions &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-1846) and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-10301) have been added for boolean data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataset&quot;&gt;Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Expression&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy has simplified to a wrapper around literals, field references, or calls to named functions. This enables usage of any compute function while filtering with no boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parquet statistics are lazily parsed in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParquetDatasetFactory&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParquetFileFragment&lt;/code&gt; for shorter construction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;csv&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion of string columns is now faster thanks to faster UTF-8 validation of small strings (ARROW-10313).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion of floating-point columns is now faster thanks to optimized string-to-double conversion routines (ARROW-10328).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsing of ISO8601 timestamps is now more liberal: trailing zeros can be omitted in the fractional part (ARROW-10337).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed a bug where null detection could give the wrong results on some platforms (ARROW-11067).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added type inference for Date32 columns for values in the form &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/code&gt; (ARROW-11247).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;feather&quot;&gt;Feather&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed reading of compressed Feather files written with Arrow 0.17 (ARROW-11163).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;filesystem-layer&quot;&gt;Filesystem layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3 recursive tree walks now benefit from a parallel implementation, where reads of multiple child directories are now issued concurrently (ARROW-10788).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved empty directory detection to be mindful of differences between Amazon and Minio S3 implementations (ARROW-10942).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flight-rpc&quot;&gt;Flight RPC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv6 host addresses are now supported (ARROW-10475).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipc&quot;&gt;IPC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to emit dictionary deltas where possible using the IPC stream writer. This is governed by a new variable in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IpcWriteOptions&lt;/code&gt; class (ARROW-6883).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to read wider tables, which used to fail due to reaching a limit during Flatbuffers verification (ARROW-10056).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;parquet&quot;&gt;Parquet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed reading of LZ4-compressed Parquet columns emitted by the Java Parquet implementation (ARROW-11301).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed a bug where writing multiple batches of nullable nested strings to Parquet would not write any data in batches after the first one (ARROW-10493)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decimal256 data type can be read from and written to Parquet (ARROW-10607).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LargeString and LargeBinary data can now be written to Parquet (ARROW-10426).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-notes-1&quot;&gt;C# notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .NET package added initial support for Arrow Flight clients and servers. Support is enabled through two new NuGet packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Arrow.Flight/&quot;&gt;Apache.Arrow.Flight&lt;/a&gt; (client) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Arrow.Flight.AspNetCore/&quot;&gt;Apache.Arrow.Flight.AspNetCore&lt;/a&gt; (server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also fixed an issue where ArrowStreamWriter wasn’t writing schema metadata to Arrow streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;julia-notes&quot;&gt;Julia notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first release to officially include &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/julia/Arrow&quot;&gt;an implementation&lt;/a&gt; for the Julia language. The pure Julia implementation includes support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html&quot;&gt;wide coverage of the format specification&lt;/a&gt;. Additional details can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/arrow/&quot;&gt;julialang.org blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;python-notes&quot;&gt;Python notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for Python 3.9 was added (ARROW-10224), and support for Python 3.5 was removed (ARROW-5679).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for building manylinux1 packages has been removed (ARROW-11212). PyArrow continues to be available as manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimal required version for NumPy is now 1.16.6. Note that when upgrading NumPy to 1.20, you also need to upgrade pyarrow to 3.0.0 to ensure compatibility, as this pyarrow release fixed a compatibility issue with NumPy 1.20 (ARROW-10833).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute functions are now automatically exported from C++ to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pyarrow.compute&lt;/code&gt; module, and they have docstrings matching their C++ definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iter_batches()&lt;/code&gt; method is now available for reading a Parquet file iteratively (ARROW-7800).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternate memory pools (such as mimalloc, jemalloc or the C malloc-based memory pool) are now available from Python (ARROW-11049).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed a potential deadlock when importing pandas from several threads (ARROW-10519).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the C++ notes above for additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;r-notes&quot;&gt;R notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release contains new features for the Flight RPC wrapper, better support for saving R metadata (including &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sf&lt;/code&gt; spatial data) to Feather and Parquet files, several significant improvements to speed and memory management, and many other enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on what’s in the 3.0.0 R package, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/news/&quot;&gt;R changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ruby-and-c-glib-notes&quot;&gt;Ruby and C GLib notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ruby binding, 256-bit decimal support and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Arrow::FixedBinaryArrayBuilder&lt;/code&gt; are added likewise C GLib below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;c-glib&quot;&gt;C GLib&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the version 3.0.0 of C GLib consists of many new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chunked array, a record batch, and a table support &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sort_indices&lt;/code&gt; function as well as an array. These functions including array’s support to specify sorting option. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;garrow_array_sort_to_indices&lt;/code&gt; has been renamed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;garrow_array_sort_indices&lt;/code&gt; and the previous name has been deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GArrowField&lt;/code&gt; supports functions to handle metadata. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GArrowSchema&lt;/code&gt; supports &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;garrow_schema_has_metadata()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GArrowArrayBuilder&lt;/code&gt; supports to add single null, multiple nulls, single empty value, and multiple empty values. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GArrowFixedSizedBinaryArrayBuilder&lt;/code&gt; is newly supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;256-bit decimal and extension types are newly supported. Filesystem module supports Mock, HDFS, S3 file systems. Dataset module supports CSV, IPC, and Parquet file formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-notes&quot;&gt;Rust notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-arrow-crate&quot;&gt;Core Arrow Crate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the arrow crate was focused on four main aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the crate usable in stable Rust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug fixing and removal of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend functionality to keep up with the specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase performance of existing kernels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;stable-rust&quot;&gt;Stable Rust&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the biggest news for this release is that all project crates, including arrow, parquet, and datafusion now build with stable Rust by default. Nightly / unstable Rust is still required when enabling the SIMD feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;parquet-arrow-writer&quot;&gt;Parquet Arrow writer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parquet Writer for Arrow arrays is now available, allowing the Rust programs to easily read and write Parquet files and making it easier to integrate with the overall Arrow ecosystem. The reader and writer include both basic and nested type support (List, Dictionary, Struct)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-class-arrow-flight-ipc-support&quot;&gt;First Class Arrow Flight IPC Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release the Arrow Flight IPC implementation in Rust became fully-featured enough to participate in the regular cross-language integration tests, thus ensuring Rust applications written using Arrow can interoperate with the rest of the ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous performance improvements in this release across the board. This includes both kernel operations, such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/code&gt;, as well as more fundamental parts such as bitwise comparison and reading and writing to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;increased-data-type-support&quot;&gt;Increased Data Type Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New DataTypes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decimal data type for fixed-width decimal values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved operation support for nested structures Dictionary, and Lists (filter, take, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-improvements&quot;&gt;Other improvements:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added support for Date and time on FFI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support for Binary type on FFI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support for i64 sized arrays to “take” kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for the i128 Decimal Type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support to cast string to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added API to create arrays out of existing arrays (e.g. for join, merge-sort, concatenate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simd feature is now also available on aarch64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;api-changes&quot;&gt;API Changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BooleanArray is no longer a PrimitiveArray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArrowNativeType no longer includes bool since arrows boolean type is represented using bitpacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Buffer methods are now infallible instead of returning a Result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataType::List now contains a Field to track metadata about the contained elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PrimitiveArray::raw_values, values_slice and values methods got replaced by a values method returning a slice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffer::data and raw_data were renamed to as_slice and as_ptr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MutableBuffer::data_mut and freeze were renamed to as_slice_mut and into to be more consistent with the stdlib naming conventions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generic type parameter for BufferBuilder was changed from ArrowPrimitiveType to ArrowNativeType&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;datafusion&quot;&gt;DataFusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release, we clarified that DataFusion will standardize on the PostgreSQL SQL dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New SQL support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COUNT DISTINCT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CASE WHEN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BETWEEN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IS IN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested SELECT statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested expressions in aggregations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOWER(), UPPER(), TRIM()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NULLIF()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SHA224(), SHA256(), SHA384(), SHA512()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DATE_TRUNC()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;performance-1&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous performance improvements in this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizations for JOINs such as using vectorized hashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started with adding statistics and cost-based optimizations. We choose the smaller side of a join as the build side if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved parallelism when reading partitioned Parquet data sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent writes of CSV and Parquet partitions to file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;parquet-crate&quot;&gt;Parquet Crate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parquet has the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nested reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support to write booleans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support to write temporal types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;roadmap-for-400&quot;&gt;Roadmap for 4.0.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also started building up a shared community roadmap for 4.0: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qspsOM_dknOxJKdGvKbC1aoVoO0M3i6x1CIo58mmN2Y/edit#heading=h.kstb571j5g5j&quot;&gt;Apache Arrow: Crowd Sourced Rust Roadmap for Arrow 4.0, January 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Parquet Fixed reading of LZ4-compressed Parquet columns emitted by the Java Parquet implementation (ARROW-11301). Fixed a bug where writing multiple batches of nullable nested strings to Parquet would not write any data in batches after the first one (ARROW-10493) The Decimal256 data type can be read from and written to Parquet (ARROW-10607). LargeString and LargeBinary data can now be written to Parquet (ARROW-10426). C# notes The .NET package added initial support for Arrow Flight clients and servers. Support is enabled through two new NuGet packages Apache.Arrow.Flight (client) and Apache.Arrow.Flight.AspNetCore (server). Also fixed an issue where ArrowStreamWriter wasn’t writing schema metadata to Arrow streams. Julia notes This is the first release to officially include an implementation for the Julia language. The pure Julia implementation includes support for wide coverage of the format specification. Additional details can be found in the julialang.org blog post. Python notes Support for Python 3.9 was added (ARROW-10224), and support for Python 3.5 was removed (ARROW-5679). Support for building manylinux1 packages has been removed (ARROW-11212). PyArrow continues to be available as manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 wheels. The minimal required version for NumPy is now 1.16.6. Note that when upgrading NumPy to 1.20, you also need to upgrade pyarrow to 3.0.0 to ensure compatibility, as this pyarrow release fixed a compatibility issue with NumPy 1.20 (ARROW-10833). Compute functions are now automatically exported from C++ to the pyarrow.compute module, and they have docstrings matching their C++ definition. An iter_batches() method is now available for reading a Parquet file iteratively (ARROW-7800). Alternate memory pools (such as mimalloc, jemalloc or the C malloc-based memory pool) are now available from Python (ARROW-11049). Fixed a potential deadlock when importing pandas from several threads (ARROW-10519). See the C++ notes above for additional details. R notes This release contains new features for the Flight RPC wrapper, better support for saving R metadata (including sf spatial data) to Feather and Parquet files, several significant improvements to speed and memory management, and many other enhancements. For more on what’s in the 3.0.0 R package, see the R changelog. Ruby and C GLib notes Ruby In Ruby binding, 256-bit decimal support and Arrow::FixedBinaryArrayBuilder are added likewise C GLib below. C GLib In the version 3.0.0 of C GLib consists of many new features. A chunked array, a record batch, and a table support sort_indices function as well as an array. These functions including array’s support to specify sorting option. garrow_array_sort_to_indices has been renamed to garrow_array_sort_indices and the previous name has been deprecated. GArrowField supports functions to handle metadata. GArrowSchema supports garrow_schema_has_metadata() function. GArrowArrayBuilder supports to add single null, multiple nulls, single empty value, and multiple empty values. GArrowFixedSizedBinaryArrayBuilder is newly supported. 256-bit decimal and extension types are newly supported. Filesystem module supports Mock, HDFS, S3 file systems. Dataset module supports CSV, IPC, and Parquet file formats. Rust notes Core Arrow Crate The development of the arrow crate was focused on four main aspects: Make the crate usable in stable Rust Bug fixing and removal of unsafe code Extend functionality to keep up with the specification Increase performance of existing kernels Stable Rust Possibly the biggest news for this release is that all project crates, including arrow, parquet, and datafusion now build with stable Rust by default. Nightly / unstable Rust is still required when enabling the SIMD feature. Parquet Arrow writer The Parquet Writer for Arrow arrays is now available, allowing the Rust programs to easily read and write Parquet files and making it easier to integrate with the overall Arrow ecosystem. The reader and writer include both basic and nested type support (List, Dictionary, Struct) First Class Arrow Flight IPC Support This release the Arrow Flight IPC implementation in Rust became fully-featured enough to participate in the regular cross-language integration tests, thus ensuring Rust applications written using Arrow can interoperate with the rest of the ecosystem Performance There have been numerous performance improvements in this release across the board. This includes both kernel operations, such as take, filter, and cast, as well as more fundamental parts such as bitwise comparison and reading and writing to CSV. Increased Data Type Support New DataTypes: Decimal data type for fixed-width decimal values Improved operation support for nested structures Dictionary, and Lists (filter, take, etc) Other improvements: Added support for Date and time on FFI Added support for Binary type on FFI Added support for i64 sized arrays to “take” kernel Support for the i128 Decimal Type Added support to cast string to date Added API to create arrays out of existing arrays (e.g. for join, merge-sort, concatenate) The simd feature is now also available on aarch64 API Changes BooleanArray is no longer a PrimitiveArray ArrowNativeType no longer includes bool since arrows boolean type is represented using bitpacking Several Buffer methods are now infallible instead of returning a Result DataType::List now contains a Field to track metadata about the contained elements PrimitiveArray::raw_values, values_slice and values methods got replaced by a values method returning a slice Buffer::data and raw_data were renamed to as_slice and as_ptr MutableBuffer::data_mut and freeze were renamed to as_slice_mut and into to be more consistent with the stdlib naming conventions The generic type parameter for BufferBuilder was changed from ArrowPrimitiveType to ArrowNativeType DataFusion SQL In this release, we clarified that DataFusion will standardize on the PostgreSQL SQL dialect. New SQL support: JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN COUNT DISTINCT CASE WHEN USING BETWEEN IS IN Nested SELECT statements Nested expressions in aggregations LOWER(), UPPER(), TRIM() NULLIF() SHA224(), SHA256(), SHA384(), SHA512() DATE_TRUNC() Performance There have been numerous performance improvements in this release: Optimizations for JOINs such as using vectorized hashing. We started with adding statistics and cost-based optimizations. We choose the smaller side of a join as the build side if possible. Improved parallelism when reading partitioned Parquet data sources Concurrent writes of CSV and Parquet partitions to file Parquet Crate The Parquet has the following improvements: Nested reading Support to write booleans Add support to write temporal types Roadmap for 4.0.0 We have also started building up a shared community roadmap for 4.0: Apache Arrow: Crowd Sourced Rust Roadmap for Arrow 4.0, January 2021.</og:description>

<title>Sequencing your DNA with a USB dongle and open source code</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Remember the scene from the Matrix where Neo unlocks his full power, and the world around him is revealed as lines of code running in all directions? What if you could see the world around you in this way, so that the person sitting next to you was a webpage where one could right-click to inspect element and find the source code underneath? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not quite there yet, but recent breakthroughs in nanopore sequencing, driven by developments in open-source software, have made it possible to greatly reduce the time it takes to decode a genome, shrinking what used to be a 15-day process to three days or less. It wasn’t so long ago that decoding a genome took years! To understand the code behind these new techniques, which have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0731-9&quot;&gt;dubbed UNCALLED&lt;/a&gt;, we chatted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.jhu.edu/members/michael-schatz/&quot;&gt;Prof. Michael Schatz&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloomberg Distinguished Associate Professor of Computer Science and Biology at Johns Hopkins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s start with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanopore_sequencing&quot;&gt;nanopore sequencer&lt;/a&gt;. “The idea for this originated about 30 years ago, and the legend is the first diagram was drawn on a napkin,” says Schatz. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mike_schatz/status/1357027611030016000&quot;&gt;In reality&lt;/a&gt; the original concept for nanopore sequencing was sketched out by Dr. David Deamer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UCSC_BSOE&quot;&gt;@UCSC_BSOE&lt;/a&gt;) in a stenographer’s notebook using a red ink ballpoint pen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtUgz89WgAs9PGO?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a hole so tiny that a single strand of DNA can fit through at a time. Push your genetic material through this pore, and the As, Ts, Gs, and Cs that make up a human genome will be revealed in sequence. So, how do you tell the four building blocks of DNA apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; src=&quot;https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nanopore-sequencer.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17379&quot;/&gt;Image via Oxford Nanopore. Learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;“It takes the most exquisite measurements you can imagine, measuring the changes in current associated with different bits of DNA,” he explains. “This is happening at the level of pico-amps—one-trillionth of an amp measurement—and we can get these readings in real time.” Five years ago, the equipment needed for this work would have been restricted to serious research facilities. Today, for about a thousand dollars, you can purchase a nanopore sequencer as a peripheral that connects to any computer via USB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequencing produces very noisy electrical data, but Schatz and his team have developed a fuzzy logic inspired by a Markov model to decode each protein in near-real time. “I mean, it’s basically out of Star Trek, right?” says Schatz excitedly. “Nucleotides are passing through this tiny hole, and we’re measuring the current four thousand times a second.” The software is decoding the sequence in real time so that it can be matched to different genetic markers. So, for example, you could identify if it’s likely to be a pathogenic bacteria or a gene associated with cancer. More importantly, you can ignore fragments that aren’t of use at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bit of DNA passing through this little hole is a charged molecule. The software allows a user to actually reverse the voltage on an individual molecule, which has the effect of ejecting it out of the nanopore. It’s this ability to selectively sequence only the sections that are relevant to the work at hand which allows for such massive improvements in speed. “There is an API call to pick and choose which molecules you want to work with,” says Schatz. “It’s just amazing to me that this is even possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Read_Until_GIF_07.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17380&quot;/&gt;Image via Oxford Nanopore. Learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-processing-the-language-of-life&quot;&gt;Processing the language of life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each DNA fragment returns a voltage reading based on its nucleotides. So, when you get a voltage, how hard is that lookup call? It’s not a simple table but rather some very fuzzy logic matching. “For the electrical data what you might want is for the A nucleotides, there’s one particular current, for the C a different current, etc,” says Schatz. “But you don’t get that at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrical current is actually associated with several nucleotides in a row. About six nucleotides are the most influential. You can think of the electrical current like the DNA is being ratcheted through this little hole. “So you actually sense the same nucleotide about six different times in different contexts in six surrounding nucleotides.” The current is very noisy. For a particular current measurement there are typically  hundreds of nucleotides sequences that it could possibly represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of each combination of those six having an offset. At offset one, there’s one hundred possible nucleotides sequences; at offset two, there’s another hundred; at offset three, there’s another hundred;, and at offset four, there’s another hundred. “But it is in that combination of overlapping sequences that you can have any hopes to resolve this into a particular nucleotide since we know that the sequences must overlap.” For example, GATTACA at offset one could be followed by ATTACAT at offset two, but not TTTACAT, AATACAT, nor any other sequence that doesn’t begin ATTACA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decoding uses a logic similar to natural language processing to match that noisy electrical signal to a nucleotide sequence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the nucleotide sequence, you need to do text processing to decide where in the genome does this molecule originate from. “A lot of that technology was invented around database storage systems some 30 years ago,” says Schatz. “There’s this really powerful data structure called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform&quot;&gt;Burrows-Wheeler transform&lt;/a&gt; that is now really central to genomics these days.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanopore sequencer is incredibly cheap compared to lab tools from a few years ago. But it does require a single use cartridge, called a flow cell, to sequence DNA molecules, and the cost of those can add up quickly when trying to look at large sequences. “What the software does is, rather than having to scan through the whole genome, we can be really picky about which molecules we’re actually going to invest our sequencing into,” says Schatz. “We can pick and choose in real time which molecules will fully read out versus which molecules will eject after about one second of sequencing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if you were looking to determine if a person was carrying a variant in a gene known to be associated with hereditary cancer, like BRCA1, you would take a sample. If you wanted to profile all the material with nanopore sequencing, that would be a pretty slow and expensive process. All the molecules are mixed up in a test tube and you sequence them one at a time as they’re randomly pulled out of that collection. However, the new software from the Schatz lab called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED&quot;&gt;UNCALLED&lt;/a&gt;, led by Ph.D. student Sam Kovaka can evaluate in near real time if a sequence is worth studying or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, during a normal sequence, you are likely to want to sequence the genome more than once, since any sample you take has a random collection of DNA molecules, and may not contain the parts you are most interested in. With the ability to select, you can winnow down what you’re looking for faster and avoid sequencing other areas over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, for example, take the example of infectious disease, which is on everyone’s mind these days. Labs around the world are struggling with massive workloads as testing explodes. “In that scenario, the human genome is kind of boring. That’s not really what you’re looking for.” Schatz says. With UNCALLED, the nanopore would eject anything obviously human. “Anything that doesn’t match the human genome, we’ll go back and we’ll try to hold on to it and so we can do some real-time analysis of what it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h-open-sourcing-our-source-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open sourcing our source code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Schatz first got into the world of genomics, the industry had a fairly bad reputation for being closed off and proprietary. “In the very early days, there was an effort to do a lot of gene patenting. There were some high profile cases about genes associated with breast cancer, for example. There were efforts to patent these sequences and charge extraordinary amounts of money to do what is now a very basic analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, says Schatz, that tendency has changed for the better in recent years. “There’s been several waves of technologies over the last twenty years, so there’s a real sense of urgency. Even though all those sequencers just write out the nucleotide sequences, every platform has different properties and characteristics and errors associated with it. So there’s a real rush to develop software that can overcome these differences and make the best use of the data from the different platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not make the software into a proprietary product? Well, speed matters. “If you try to commercialize it, that takes a while to start a company, and it can take so long that by the time you go to the mechanics of that, the next thing has already emerged. There’s such a race there that it’s hard to commercialize the software for the long term.” Schatz continues, “Plus our work is largely funded through government sponsored grants, so this is one of the important ways for us to give back to society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current climate is far healthier and happier for academics like Schatz, who plans to continue open sourcing the software being created by his lab. “There’s just so much benefit from being able to share code and work collaboratively. In almost all cases the pros outweigh any sort of potential negatives.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Still Use RSS</title>
<link>https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;Marc%20on%202021-02-03&quot;&gt;Marc on 2021-02-03&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;Really-Simple-Syndication&lt;/a&gt;, is (or &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the &lt;em&gt;curated&lt;/em&gt; timeline). I've already spoken before about my &lt;a href=&quot;https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html&quot;&gt;general disinterest with Social Media&lt;/a&gt; but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious &lt;a href=&quot;https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.91689008042895&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.5974025974026&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss&quot;&gt;Reddit still offers RSS support&lt;/a&gt; by appending &lt;code&gt;/.rss&lt;/code&gt; to the end of a given URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsboat.org/&quot;&gt;Newsboat&lt;/a&gt; (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://atthis.link/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; to your reader?&lt;/p&gt;

We've made it as easy as possible to get running on Amazon AWS and you can run it on a Raspberry PI in your living room or anywhere else.

<title>IBM has cut its blockchain team down to almost nothing – sources</title>
<link>https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-revenue-misses-job-cuts-sources</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-revenue-misses-job-cuts-sources</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;node-0&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;IBM has cut its blockchain team down to almost nothing, according to four people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;node-1&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-2&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;node-4&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35.494505494505&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/ibm-blockchain-vp-every-dollar-spent-on-blockchain-yields-15-on-cloud&quot;&gt;two years in a row&lt;/a&gt;, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-5&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-6&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;node-8&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-9&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-10&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-11&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&amp;amp;D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-12&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;32.138408304498&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In its recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-01-21-IBM-Reports-2020-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;full-year results statement&lt;/a&gt;, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-01-18-IBM-Reports-2017-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No more TV commercials &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-14&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-15&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;node-17&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-18&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-19&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-20&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-21&quot; class=&quot;article-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-22&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Seward contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-23&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (Feb. 1, 19:42 UTC):&lt;/strong&gt; Adds additional comment from IBM spokesperson Holli Haswell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How to Lose Money</title>
<link>https://www.getrevue.co/profile/andrewtye/issues/how-to-lose-money-323332</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.getrevue.co/profile/andrewtye/issues/how-to-lose-money-323332</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Trade Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fastest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;revue-p&quot; readability=&quot;11.66976744186&quot;&gt;I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use this link to start trading with Cash App&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll get free money to lose right away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Andrew Tye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Write a Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most consistent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;revue-p&quot; readability=&quot;13.712082262211&quot;&gt;You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;take a look here&lt;/a&gt; if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Teach Online Courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most helpful&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get a Degree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most socially acceptable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;revue-p&quot; readability=&quot;21.637515842839&quot;&gt;This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research here&lt;/a&gt;). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Become an Inventor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most fun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barking Bulb&lt;/em&gt;: Scare away intruders with a bark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;amp;D or go to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Do Internet Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most controversial &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Stop finishing Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biggest loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for free until you quit + lost opportunity cost from what might have been. In fact, you could say I’ve lost billions on this one by not seeing my projects through. Thankfully some of my biggest ideas were cut short at the napkin stage! Otherwise they would doubtless have gone on to become unicorns and I wouldn’t even be qualified to write this HTLM guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;revue-p&quot; readability=&quot;15.685039370079&quot;&gt;Another benefit of this method is that you can tell your friends you had the idea for X before X did. This has happened to me a lot and it makes me feel super smart. Here is one of my billion dollar ideas that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/grabb-it-wants-to-turn-your-cars-window-into-a-trippy-video-billboard/?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this YC company&lt;/a&gt; is now doing. I had the genius idea, they are the suckers actually out there executing and making money. Here is another one – about ten years ago I wanted to build a last mile taxi and delivery service where drivers would use their own cars and the app would tell them whether to pick someone up or deliver a pizza or transfer some parts. Less than two years later Lyft started and Uber pivoted. But look at all the trouble they’ve had! I am the fortunate one here, and you can be as well. Just make sure to quit at the idea stage.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Buy $GME Swag (Bonus Method)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most satisfying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;revue-p&quot; readability=&quot;6.6788990825688&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gmeswag.com?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buy some $GME swag from me right now&lt;/a&gt; to lose money instantly. No need to delay gratification. And as a side benefit it will help me make ends meet since I’ve lost so much money but still need to pay bills and such. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked this, please share it with your friends. And thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UCSF team has engineered a tiny antibody capable of neutralizing the coronavirus</title>
<link>https://www.ucsf.edu/magazine/covid-aeronabs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ucsf.edu/magazine/covid-aeronabs</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;page_narrow&quot; readability=&quot;188.10051969365&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;At 2 a.m. one night last April, Michael Schoof triple-checked the numbers on his screen, took a deep breath, and fired off an email he’d been waiting all day to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s working” was the cautious wording of his message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schoof, a graduate student in the lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/peter.walter&quot;&gt;Peter Walter, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned scientist specializing in protein sorting and cellular membranes, was part of a small team on a quixotic mission: to immobilize SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID, by using a synthetic version of tiny antibodies originally discovered in llamas and camels. These “nanobodies,” as they’re known, had come from the UC San Francisco lab of &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/aashish.manglik&quot;&gt;Aashish Manglik, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an up-and-coming protein scientist who had spent the previous three years building a vast library of nanobodies and developing new ways to exploit their unusual properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the previous month, Schoof had spent most of his waking hours cloistered in the otherwise empty lab complex on UCSF’s Mission Bay campus. It was the height of COVID’s spring 2020 surge, and only essential health care staff and those working on science related to the pandemic were allowed into the University’s facilities. Schoof had dragooned his roommate, a fellow grad student named Reuben Saunders, into working with him on the project. Subsisting on steamed dumplings and gallons of tea, they had been sorting through the 2 billion nanobodies in Manglik’s library in the hope of identifying a molecule capable of glomming on to the deadly SARS-CoV-2 and immobilizing it. Now, finally, Schoof was convinced they had achieved their first big breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in any viral infection is a cellular hijacking. To gain control of a human cell, SARS-CoV-2 latches the grappling-hook-like spikes on its own exterior to proteins called ACE2 receptors on the exterior of a target cell. But what if, the researchers wondered, they could block the hijacker by giving the grappling hooks something else to latch onto?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day, Schoof had begun running tests on hundreds of colonies of yeast, each engineered to produce certain nanobodies from Manglik’s library. All of these particular nanobodies had demonstrated an ability to latch onto SARS-CoV-2’s spikes. Now it was time to ask the key questions: How tightly had these nanobodies bound to the spikes? Were they able to compete with the ACE2 receptors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP7//wAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;1020&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; alt=&quot;Portrait of graduate student Michael Schoof.&quot; class=&quot;lazyload element-fade&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/full_bleed_half__image/public/2021-01/michael-schoof-aeronabs_0.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCSF graduate student Michael Schoof’s work was integral to the team’s success. &lt;em&gt;Photo: Steve Babuljak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Schoof had mixed his nanobody-expressing yeast cells with fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 spikes. When he looked at the results from the first two plates, he felt a rush of excitement, which he quickly tempered with the scientific skepticism he’d been taught to cultivate. Some of the nanobodies were sticking to the SARS-CoV-2 spikes but could still be elbowed aside by an excess of human ACE2 receptors: clear evidence of a potential neutralizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That,” he recalls, “is when we knew we had something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed Schoof’s circumspect late-night email, Walter and Manglik tapped their respective networks of scientific contacts, calling in reinforcements from labs across campus and as far away as Paris to aid in the next stage of their search. Soon, the tiny team had morphed into a veritable army of cross-disciplinary researchers and graduate students. In November, they published &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/04/science.abe3255&quot;&gt;their results&lt;/a&gt; in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. In the paper, almost 60 co-authors described a bold, innovative COVID countermeasure, proposing that their nanobodies could be used in an inexpensive, easy-to-transport nasal spray capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. Among themselves, they dubbed the molecules AeroNabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the UCSF team has been seeking an industry partner willing to bankroll the costly and rigorous clinical trial process, but currently pharmaceutical companies are focused on vaccine development for prevention and more traditional antibodies for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the nanobody approach is promising. Due to the simple structure of nanobodies, AeroNabs could be far cheaper and faster to mass-produce, far easier to transport, and far easier to store than the traditional antibodies currently in use and under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is something that you could take after testing positive that could diminish your viral load immediately,” Walter says. “So your chances of developing severe disease would be reduced by this treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also notes that mass vaccination will take time, and that not everyone in the population can or will be vaccinated, making passive protection still incredibly valuable. “And,” he adds, “we don’t know how widely the vaccine will be available beyond the world’s richest countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic duo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seeds of the AeroNabs project were planted in 2017, when Walter heard Manglik deliver a talk on his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the two scientists appear to be an odd couple. With his full head of dark hair, boyish smile, and clean-shaven chin, Manglik could be mistaken for a graduate student. In fact, he’s a rising star in his field who in 2013 made &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;’s “30 under 30” list. Born in India, Manglik spent his first eight years in Saudi Arabia before his family immigrated to Des Moines, Iowa, where he discovered science in college. The 60-something Walter, on the other hand, sports a full white beard and mustache and small-lensed spectacles. He was born and grew up in Germany, came to the U.S. for his graduate work, and has charted a legendary career. His many honors include the prestigious Lasker Award, often seen as a precursor to a Nobel Prize. But despite their differences, Walter and Manglik share a profound passion for molecular biology and its endlessly flexible organic building blocks: proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP7//wAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;754&quot; alt=&quot;Peter Walter (left), PhD and Aashish Manglik (right), MD, PhD, stand outside Genentech Hall at UCSF’s Mission Bay Campus.&quot; class=&quot;lazyload element-fade&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/full_bleed__image/public/2021-01/walter-manglik-aeronabs.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Walter (left) and Aashish Manglik (right), photographed at UCSF’s Mission Bay campus, share a fascination with proteins. &lt;em&gt;Photo: Noah Berger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manglik’s talk that day was about his effort to assemble one of the world’s largest libraries of nanobodies – a promising, relatively new type of antibody derived from the blood of llamas, camels, and other animals in the camelid family. He had first learned about nanobodies in graduate school at Stanford, after falling in love with the study of receptors, a broad family of proteins involved in intercellular signaling. Receptors stick out of cells like antennae, each one responding to a specific chemical signal. While studying human adrenaline receptors, Manglik made extensive use of nanobodies, which, thanks to their tiny size, can interact with receptors with far more precision than the custom-made antibodies he was using to explore receptor properties. His experiments revealed how different geometrical configurations of receptors influence their signaling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Proteins are not just simple Legos that fit together – they are like Legos made out of jello or putty,” Manglik explains. “They’re constantly moving. In fact, it’s the movement of a protein, it turns out, that really matters for how it works. And nanobodies can help us control that movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanobodies were discovered in the late 1980s by a pair of undergraduates at the Free University of Brussels, after they famously approached their biology professor, an immunologist named Raymond Hamers, to complain about an assignment. History has obscured the reason for their complaint; one widely cited account holds that the students were worried that the assignment, which required them to analyze the antibodies in human blood, might infect them with a disease. Another version has it that the students felt the experiment was boring and asked their professor to assign them something more original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the truth, no one disputes what happened next. Rummaging around in a laboratory refrigerator, Hamers found a vial of frozen dromedary camel serum infected with parasites thought to cause African sleeping sickness. He gave it to the students and suggested that they isolate the antibodies in the camel blood to see what they looked like. When the students purified the blood, they discovered something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the standard antibodies found in all vertebrates, the purified samples contained a derivative antibody never before seen in science – smaller, simpler proteins, which the students at first mistook for fragments of conventional antibodies. Further examination revealed them to be an entirely new class of immune agents, lacking one of the protein chains found in all other previously studied antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery led to a groundbreaking 1993 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/363446a0&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Hamers and his students dubbed the new diminutive proteins nanobodies. Similar single-chain antibodies were later identified in llamas, alpacas, guanacos (another long-necked South American mammal), and even sharks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent not only that nanobodies were useful immunologically, but that their small size made them useful experimental tools – as Manglik and his UCSF colleagues can amply confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph-text-block&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying how these gelatinous molecular-level building blocks move, snap and unsnap, and interact became Manglik’s focus when he joined the UCSF faculty. He knew early on that nanobodies would be a big part of his work. Though antibodies and nanobodies exist to help animals fight off infection, Manglik also sees them as an endlessly malleable tool that can be used to hack into a wide array of processes in the human body as well as decode basic scientific mysteries. But nanobodies were time-consuming to make and required access to camelids. As a graduate student, Manglik had relied on a collaborator in Belgium who would inject a receptor protein of interest into a llama, then harvest the nanobodies from the animal’s blood. The entire process took months of very specialized work, which only a few groups had the capability to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To democratize access to nanobodies for researchers everywhere, Manglik teamed up with Andrew Kruse, PhD, a close friend from grad school who had joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School. Together, the two labs created trillions of unique nanobody-encoding DNA sequences, each inspired by the nanobodies normally found inside llamas. The DNA sequences for these nanobodies are housed in a vast pool of billions of diminutive yeast cells, each of which can be coaxed to put a copy of an individual nanobody on its surface. Completely bypassing the need for a living llama, such a library gives researchers access to yeast cells harboring nanobodies specific for any given task. Manglik and Kruse have openly shared their libraries with hundreds of labs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph-text-block&quot; readability=&quot;176&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that in an animal, there are trillions of different nanobodies to fight against anything that it can encounter,” he says. “We wanted to make a library that encoded for billions of individual nanobodies. This library would be a great starting point for finding a nanobody against basically anything – all in the lab and without the need to inject an animal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing Manglik explain all this, Walter steered his graduate student Michael Schoof to Manglik’s lab. Schoof was trying to modulate the behavior of a protein related to traumatic brain injury, and Walter suspected that Manglik’s nanobodies might be useful in that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the coronavirus hit, the world stopped, and nearly all non-COVID-related activity at the University shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So at that point, we said, ‘Well, we can either sit at home now, or we can think how we can really help in this push for a solution,’” Walter recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few days, Walter and Schoof were in email contact with Manglik. They knew the disease-fighting properties of nanobodies. A nanobody technology had recently won FDA approval to treat a blood-clotting disorder, and another one, used to treat a respiratory virus, had reached late-stage clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it possible they could build one to fight the coronavirus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An amazing result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From the beginning, the team knew, the success of the project would rest on their ability to find a nanobody with sufficient binding affinity – the ability to attach to and straitjacket the coronavirus’s spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins have specific shapes. How well two proteins fit together determines their binding affinity. Walter and Manglik knew that the binding affinity that causes SARS-CoV-2 to adhere to ACE2 proteins could theoretically be overpowered by a nanobody shaped in just the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manglik already had a key ingredient for such an experiment. Researchers at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin had recently revealed the unique structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spikes which allowed the virus to bind to human cells’ ACE2 receptors. Manglik reached out to UT’s Jason McLellan, PhD, who agreed to send him their “construct” – a piece of DNA coding for the spikes that could be inserted into another cell, expressed in large quantities, purified, and used for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article data-embed-button=&quot;remote_video&quot; data-entity-embed-display=&quot;view_mode:media.full&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;media&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;249c1149-0e7d-4da6-92f2-c5bcbfdcc435&quot; data-langcode=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;embedded-entity&quot;&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;media media--type-remote-video media--view-mode-full&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team began screening the 2 billion nanobodies in the library to see if they could find compounds with the right binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spikes. Within three weeks, they’d identified 800 potential candidates, and a week later Schoof wrote his cautious late-night email informing Manglik and Walter that he’d seen some initial positive results. By late April, the team had identified 21 distinct nanobodies that seemed to compete with the ACE2 receptor, theoretically blocking the SARS-CoV-2 attachment mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when the tiny team began to supersize, recruiting structural biologists to zero in on how the nanobodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and then using this information to design modifications to make them even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That required purifying 21 candidate proteins, testing their binding, and then using UCSF’s cryo-electron microscopy facilities to image at near-atomic resolution the most promising candidates, while they were bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike. To complete this monumental task, they joined forces with a parallel effort known as the QCRG Structural Biology Consortium – an assembly-line-like process put together by 12 UCSF faculty members and over 60 trainees to tackle SARS-CoV-2. The effort was fueled by a sense of urgency, and the participants worked grueling hours late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the team had images of the top nanobodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, they began to examine each nanobody’s unique binding mechanism and used that information to design a next-generation version. They settled on constructing a three-armed nanobody consisting of three copies of a single nanobody stitched together so it could bind simultaneously to the three separate arms that make up each coronavirus spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stitching together the nanobodies and testing them, Bryan Faust, a graduate student in Manglik’s lab, delivered the next exciting finding: Each of the three arms enhanced the binding of its neighbors exponentially. The ability of the improved version to bind to the viral spikes increased &lt;em&gt;two-hundred-thousandfold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was an amazing result – to see this huge order of improvement,” Walter recalls. “It was absolute celebration time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP7//wAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;852&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of a person using a handheld nebulizer inhaler; SARS-CoV-2 cells are floating in the background and bubble surround some of their ACE2 receptors.&quot; class=&quot;lazyload element-fade&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/styles/full_bleed__image/public/2021-01/aeronabs-inhaler-kouzou-sakai.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nanobody that the team engineered could be used in an inexpensive, easy-to-transport nasal spray or inhaler. &lt;em&gt;Illustration: Kouzou Sakai | Folio Art&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the compound against a live virus, the team needed a laboratory with a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) designation. The group recruited Marco Vignuzzi, PhD, a former UCSF postdoc who runs a BSL-3 lab at Institut Pasteur in Paris. By June, one of Vignuzzi’s postdocs was running the UCSF nanobody against actual SARS-CoV-2 to see if it was capable of neutralizing the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result was both highly effective and stable – so stable that it can be delivered in aerosol form using a mesh nebulizer that Manglik purchased on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Big Pharma laser-focused on developing vaccines and traditional antibodies, finding a quick path to commercialization has proved challenging. But Manglik, Walter, and their team are undeterred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost certain that there will be more respiratory pandemics in our lifetime,” says Manglik. “It could be influenza, anther SARS pandemic, or some pathogen we don’t even know about yet. For the next pandemic, the hope is that researchers could go not only as fast as we did, but maybe even faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without doubt, it would be hard to find a more potent testament to the delightful unpredictability and potential of modern science – that a pandemic which has caused loneliness, suffering, and death also gave rise to this eclectic crew and their potentially lifesaving solution that just a few years ago might have seemed absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just one of those things where you say, ‘We want to go on this adventure,’” Walter says. “We committed to it, and then it just worked much better then we could have dreamt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
