&lt;h4&gt;Description:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Under general relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead it is a distortion of spacetime. Objects in free-fall move along geodesics (straight lines) in spacetime, as seen in the inertial frame of reference on the right. When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen in the accelerating frame of reference on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In this system there is only one space dimension, shown on the vertical axis and labeled in meters. The time dimension is the horizontal axis and labeled in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Use the first slider to change the acceleration of the frame of reference in the middle. When the frame has zero acceleration it is said to be an inertial frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Use the second slider to move the time window. Note that all the trajectories remain as straight lines in the inertial frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;You can drag the start and end position of each object to change their trajectories. All free-fall trajectories in the inertial frame of reference are straight lines.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;66.996902106568&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption text-grey&quot;&gt;Oct 18, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Growing a forest in the middle of the desert has become reality with Egypt eyeing more of these projects to support its economy and fight environmental and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/egypt-climate-change-rising-sea-level-nile-river-delta.html&quot;&gt;climate changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Egypt has managed to plant trees in the desert using wastewater, as part of plans to preserve the environment, reduce pollution and optimize the use of natural water resources. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/forestry/35800-094f4eedb0c86a4a33be1a3d906d80d3f.pdf&quot;&gt;Serapium Forest&lt;/a&gt;, which has boomed despite the drought and rainfall deficit, consists of 200 hectares (494 acres) of trees planted in Ismailia city, in northeast Egypt. The forest has been a vital project that set a precedent for other projects to reduce water pollution and unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;The Central Administration of Reforestation affiliated with Egypt’s Ministry of Agriculture &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knQGknNRUmk&quot;&gt;launched work&lt;/a&gt; on the Serapium Forest back in 1998. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knQGknNRUmk&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; was released in 2014 showing the results of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;In light of the success of the Serapium Forest project, African countries followed suit. In 2019, 21 African countries, including Egypt, embarked on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/4098344&quot;&gt;tree-planting project&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatgreenwall.org/about-great-green-wall&quot;&gt;Great Green Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Preparations for the project had started back in 2007. Twelve African countries, including Egypt, launched the project from Nigeria, and soon nine other countries joined the initiative. It starts from Senegal, in the far west of the continent, to Djibouti, in its east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;The project, of which only 15% has been completed, stretches over nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles). It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2030. The forest will extend over 100 million hectares (247 million acres) at an estimated cost of $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;127.29736042981&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Ragaei Saafan, project manager in Serapium, told Al-Monitor that using sewage water to grow a forest in the desert is a golden idea and helps boost the economy. He explained that the treated sewage water will help transform large areas of the Egyptian desert into arable and economically viable areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;He said that the evergreen forests would purify the air, combat desertification and help reduce the high summer temperature. He added that there is a tree leaf cutter machine in the Serapium Forest, allowing cypress, pine and other deciduous conifers leaves to be used as fertilizers and feed for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/09/egypt-demolish-houses-urban-expansion-farmland-agriculture.html&quot;&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a possibility to raise livestock without any significant cost, except for the potable water, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Saafan pointed out that in addition to its role in maintaining soil fertility, this forest serves the local economy. He explained that a good management would allow some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/06/egypt-launch-initiative-nature-reserves-environment.html&quot;&gt;planted trees&lt;/a&gt;, such as the mahogany and camphor, to serve as a permanent source of income in Egypt by exporting the trees or using them in the local wood industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Commenting on how the treated sewage water is channeled to Serapium Forest, Saafan explained that the wastewater is channeled in big underground basins high in micro-organisms, and oxygen is pumped to accelerate the water purification process. The water, high in nitrogen and phosphorus, which are good for the forest, is then stored throughout the forest. According to him, the trees have grown four times faster than in any other forest in Europe where the weather is much more favorable. While an average of 60 years is needed for a tree in Europe to become mature, 15 years is more than enough for the trees to mature in this forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Commenting on the Ministry of Agriculture’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eeaa.gov.eg/ar-eg/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.aspx&quot;&gt;plan to implement&lt;/a&gt; the experience in the other governorates, Sayed Khalifa, head of the Central Administration for Agricultural Extension at the ministry, told Al-Monitor that the ministry already started a plan to promote forests in the various governorates. He noted that 250 feddans (260 acres) of land in Ballanah in Aswan governorate will be planted with trees, including palm trees, after the irrigation network is set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;He added that 40 feddans (42 acres) of trees are expected to be planted in Armant in Luxor governorate, in addition to 300 feddans (311 acres) in el-Belina in Sohag governorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Khalifa said the goal behind growing forests in Egypt is to optimize the use of treated sewage water, produce wood and create new wood-based industries, produce biofuels, protect the country against desertification and erosion, solve the problem of food security, stabilize sand dunes, protect the coasts and boost tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;Commenting on the desertification rate in Egypt, Abdo Mahmoud, professor of lands studies at the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagazig University, told Al-Monitor that Egypt loses 3.5 feddans (3.6 acres) per hour, which is very dangerous given the limited agricultural lands across the country, amounting to 4% of Egypt’s total area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;He accused the successive governments of ignoring the threats of desertification, but at the same time, he praised the current serious attempts to combat desertification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;During a meeting with the minister of water and forests of Cote d'Ivoire, Alain-Richard Donwahi, in October 2018, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Ezz El-Din Abu Steit had said that there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1334350&quot;&gt;33 forests&lt;/a&gt; across the Egyptian governorates linked to sewage stations, in addition to 28 forest nurseries to supply forests with seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;The minister added that since Africa is the natural extension of Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for further cooperation with all African countries, particularly in the agricultural sector, according to the Middle East News Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body_copy text-black&quot;&gt;During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_egypt/details/2018/6/28/1384037/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B1%D8%BA%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE&quot;&gt;seminar&lt;/a&gt; held in 2018 at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arc.sci.eg/InstsLabs/Default.aspx?OrgID=19&amp;amp;lang=ar&quot;&gt;Regional Center for Food and Feed&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with the Agricultural Research Center, Sisi’s adviser Hani el-Kateb said that Egypt has no experience in growing forests, although its weather is favorable for that. He stressed the need for Egypt to take advantage of such weather in growing forests and cited water scarcity and network problems as top obstacles in this regard. He pointed out that ancient Egyptians and Chinese used the Phragmites in their irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reading too much political news is bad for your well-being</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/10/reading-too-much-political-news-bad-happiness/616651</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/10/reading-too-much-political-news-bad-happiness/616651</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8iajp0n7MqeUbxVS7lFMR0q1KvM=/media/img/posts/2020/06/smiley/original.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/category/how-build-life/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;How to Build a Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;” is a biweekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;Of the many ideas from Eastern religion and philosophy that have permeated Western thinking, the second “noble truth” of Buddhism arguably shines the greatest light on our happiness—or lack thereof. &lt;em&gt;Samudaya&lt;/em&gt;, as this truth is also known, teaches that attachment is the root of human suffering. To find peace in life, we must be willing to detach ourselves and thus become free of sticky cravings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This requires that we honestly examine our attachments. What are yours? Money, power, pleasure, prestige? Dig deeper: Just maybe, they are your &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt;. The Buddha himself named this attachment and its terrible effects more than 2,400 years ago in the &lt;em&gt;Aṭṭhakavagga Sutta&lt;/em&gt;, when he is believed to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.audiodharma.org/documents/AtthakavaggaHandOut.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Those attached to perception and views roam the world offending people.” More recently, the Vietnamese Buddhist sage Thích Nhất Hạnh wrote in his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/Being_Peace/ZqYr2gP6ZtUC?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CHumankind+suffers+very+much+from+attachment+to+views.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;pg=PT65&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being Peace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Humankind suffers very much from attachment to views.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the election season heats up, many Americans are attached to their opinions—especially their political ones—as if they were their life’s savings; they obsess over their beliefs like lonely misers, and lash out angrily when they are threatened. This is the source of much suffering, for the politically obsessed and everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;Little research has been conducted on the direct links between happiness and one’s attention to politics. The indirect evidence, however, is not encouraging. For example, Dutch researchers in 2017 conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/17278406/a000224.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on how hard news that tends to provide a political perspective affects well-being. They found that on average, well-being falls 6.1 percent for every additional television hard news program watched a week. They explained this by noting the dominance of negative stories on such programs, and the powerlessness viewers might feel in the face of all that bad news. It’s difficult to imagine that stories about political news in America would have any less of a negative impact—especially given how fraught and contentious United States politics is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/jonathan-haidt-pandemic-and-americas-polarization/612025/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Jonathan Haidt is trying to heal America’s divisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to see more clearly how attention to politics is directly associated with life satisfaction, I conducted an analysis using 2014 data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;General Social Survey&lt;/a&gt;. After controlling for household income, education, age, gender, race, marital status, and political views, I found that people who were “very interested in politics” were about 8 percentage points more likely to be “not very happy” about life than people who were “not very interested” in politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch researchers’ point about negativity and powerlessness might play a role here, but something even more important might be happening. I believe that today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; climate, media &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalism.org/2020/01/24/u-s-media-polarization-and-the-2020-election-a-nation-divided/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;polarization&lt;/a&gt;, and constant political debates are interfering directly with the fuel of happiness, which is love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, our growing focus on politics is driving what social scientists call “political homophily,” which means assortative mating by political viewpoint. Scholars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/687533&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; online dating profiles find that political views are comparable in importance to education levels in choosing one’s romantic partner. Presumably, this reflects a growing belief that people’s votes are a proxy for their character and morals. Right or wrong, this is a joy killer: If politics is so important as to preclude romantic love where it otherwise might have blossomed, happiness will fall as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents might also contribute to this amorous sorting. Three decades ago, when I was on a path to marriage, I don’t remember my mom and dad asking about my future wife’s political views. And traditionally, that wasn’t too important for most parents in America. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/upshot/are-you-married-to-your-party.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt;, according to a Gallup Poll, 33 percent of parents who were Democrats wanted their daughters to marry a Democrat; 25 percent of Republican parents wanted their daughters to marry a Republican. Not so in recent years: Those numbers were 60 and 63 percent, respectively, in 2016. I suspect they are even higher in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendships and family ties are compromised by political disagreements as well. Polling data &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-relationships-insight/from-disputes-to-a-breakup-wounds-still-raw-after-u-s-election-idUSKBN15M13L&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that about one in six Americans stopped talking to a friend or family member because of the 2016 election. No doubt these were mostly cases where friends and family disagree. But even when people &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt; politically, expressing intense views, or going on and on about politics, harms relationships. A 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/82/2/379/4996003?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;data analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Political Opinion Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; revealed that “even strong partisans dislike too much political discussion—even agreeable discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And beware especially of in-laws: To quote the researchers, “many people do not want their child to marry someone from their own party if that hypothetical in-law were to discuss politics frequently.” In other words, these days you need to have the right politics for your beloved’s folks, but you can’t be too intense about it. It’s a bit of a high-wire act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research doesn’t reveal precisely why we tend to dislike overly political people, but it doesn’t take too much imagination to guess that constant foam-flecked political outrage makes one quite tedious. It also impedes our ability to think clearly: At least one experiment has &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that people become less accurate in interpreting data when the data concern something politically polarizing. And lest you think you are immune to this bias if you are sophisticated with data, the research shows that highly numerate people are the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; likely to contort the numbers to fit their views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, retreating too far into one’s own political bubble makes one more ignorant of the world. A 2012 &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/final.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University asked a sample of Americans about their news-consumption habits, and quizzed them about U.S. and international political and economic events. They found that those watching the most partisan television news sources—on both the left and the right—were often less knowledgeable about world events than those who consumed no news at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Do you speak Fox?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rings starkly true to me. Whether partisan news sources can misinform us or not, they shrink our world. By engorging the political, they crowd out nearly everything else; they create a kind of tunnel vision that makes it easy to equate “news” with “politics” and pay little attention to what’s happening in other realms. And thus we become more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;In sum, if you spend the election season glued to your favorite partisan news outlet, read and share political outrage on social media, and use every opportunity to fulminate about politics, you might become less happy, less well-liked, less accurate, and less informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not advocating for everyone to stop paying attention to politics, of course. Good citizens are attentive and active in the political process. However, for quality of life’s sake—yours and others’—you would do well to put boundaries around the time and emotional energy you devote to politics this fall. To this end, I have three suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;1. Get involved instead of complaining.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the political scientist Eitan Hersh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/political-hobbyists-are-ruining-politics/605212/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;argued in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that highly educated people who consume a ton of political news are making true progress harder in this country. Their appetite for constant indignation fuels an outrage-industrial complex in media and politics, and likely makes compromise harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What they are doing is no closer to engaging in politics than watching &lt;em&gt;SportsCenter&lt;/em&gt; is to playing football,” Hersh wrote. He recommends active, local citizenship: getting involved in your community and working with others to push for positive change instead of just watching cable TV and ranting about it. Hersh recommends this for the good of the country; I recommend it for the good of your mental health and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;2. Ration your consumption of politics and limit the time you spend discussing it.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/love-and-sex-in-the-digital-age/201509/the-opposite-addiction-is-connection&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;characteristic&lt;/a&gt; of addictive behavior is the displacement of human relationships by the object of addiction. A good way to gauge whether you have a problem is to ask: Is this activity a complement to my relationships, or a substitute? In the case of politics, for many people, an honest answer would clearly be the latter; hence the willingness to damage friendships and romances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to ration your consumption of politics, and set proper boundaries around where you talk about it. I recommend limiting the consumption of all news—not just politics—to 30 minutes a day, unless news is your vocation. Much more than that and you might just be upsetting, rather than informing, yourself, or at least becoming one of Hersh’s “hobbyists.” Further, resolve to avoid political discussions during most nonpolitical occasions. It may be hard at first, but I’d wager that eventually you will savor the respite, especially during election season, when politics is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;3. Turn off ultra-partisan news sources, especially on your own side.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the website &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; introduced a satirical current-events talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theonion.com/c/video/youre-right&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;You’re Right&lt;/em&gt;. In it, the host feeds viewers their own beliefs and biases, assuring them that they are right and that those who disagree are stupid and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a parody, of course, but it captures a real reason why people often turn to partisan news sources: It brings emotional satisfaction to hear experts and famous people saying things you agree with, and denouncing those with whom you disagree. But this has deleterious effects on your relationships, and leaves you poorly informed. Once you step away for a while, you’ll most likely start to realize how much of your energy it was consuming, and how much better you feel without these influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;The fall is going to be rough, politically. The election will be brutal and bitter; there’s no way to avoid this. But Americans have to decide whether we want our own lives to be brutal and bitter as well. Each of us has political views, many of them strongly held. Each of us is convinced that we are right—and some of us might well be. But if we let these views dominate our thoughts, our time, and our conversations, they will harm our relationships and happiness. We can be happier if, sometimes, we follow the Buddha and just let our opinions go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially with the in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A legislative path to an interoperable internet</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not enough to say that the Internet is built on interoperability. The Internet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;interoperability. Billions of machines around the world use the same set of open protocols—like TCP/IP, HTTP, and TLS—to talk to one another. The first Internet-connected devices were only possible because phone lines provided interoperable communication ports, and scientists found a way to send data, rather than voice, over those phone lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the early days of the Internet, protocols dictated the rules of the road. Because the Internet was a fundamentally decentralized, open system, services on the Internet defaulted to acting the same way. Companies may have tried to build&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;their own proprietary networking protocols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;or maintain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/altinteroperabilityadversarial&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;unilateral control over the content on the network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but they ultimately failed. The ecosystem was fast-moving, chaotic, and welcoming to new ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, big platforms are ecosystems unto themselves. Companies create accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in order to interact with consumers. Platforms maintain suites of business-facing APIs that let other companies build apps to work within the boundaries of those platforms. And since they control the infrastructure that others rely on, the platforms have unilateral authority to decide who gets to use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a problem for competition. It means that users of one platform have no easy way of interacting with friends on other services unless the platform’s owners decide to allow it. It means that network effects create enormous barriers to entry for upstart communications and social networking companies. And it means that the next generation of apps that would work on top of the new ecosystems can only exist at big tech’s pleasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s where interoperability can help. In this post, we’ll discuss how to bring about a more interoperable ecosystem in two ways: first, by creating minimum standards for interoperability that the tech giants must support; and second, by removing the legal moat that incumbents use to stave off innovative, competitive interoperators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability is corporate entropy. It opens up space for chaotic, exciting new innovations, and erodes the high walls that monopolies build to protect themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Facebook and Twitter allowed anyone to fully and meaningfully interoperate with them, their size would not protect them from competition nearly as much as it does. But platforms have shown that they won’t choose to do so on their own. That’s where governments can step in: regulations could require that large platforms offer a baseline of interoperable interfaces that anyone, including competitors, can use. This would set a “floor” for how interoperable very large platforms must be. It would mean that once a walled garden becomes big enough, its owner needs to open up the gates and let others in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Requiring big companies to open up specific interfaces would only win half the battle. There are always going to be upstarts who find new, unexpected, and innovative ways to interact with platforms—often against the platforms’ will. This is called “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;adversarial interoperability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” or “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/tag/competitive-compatibility/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;competitive compatibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” Currently, U.S. law gives incumbents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/cycle-renewal-broken-how-big-tech-and-big-media-abuse-copyright-law-slay&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;legal tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/felony-contempt-business-model-lexmarks-anti-competitive-legacy&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;shut down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;those who would interoperate without the big companies’ consent. This limits the agency that users have within the services that are supposed to serve them, and it creates an artificial “ceiling” on innovation in markets dominated by monopolists. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not enough to create new legal duties for monopolists without dismantling the legal tools they themselves use to stave off competition. Likewise, it’s not enough to legalize competitive compatibility, since the platforms have such an advantage in technical resources that serious competitors’ attempts to interoperate face enormous engineering challenges. To break out of the big platforms’ suffocating hold on the market, we need both approaches. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandating Access to Monopolist Platforms: Building a Floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post will look at one possible set of regulations, proposed in the bipartisan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/10/senators-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-encourage-competition-in-social-media&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACCESS Act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that would require platforms to interoperate with everyone else. At a high level, the ACCESS Act provides a good template for ensuring upstart competitors are able to interoperate and compete with monopolists. It won’t level the playing field, but it will ensure smaller companies have the right to play at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ll present three specific kinds of interoperability mandate, borrowed from the ACCESS Act’s framing. These are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet#portability&quot;&gt;data portability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet#interoperability&quot;&gt;back-end interoperability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet#delegability&quot;&gt;delegability&lt;/a&gt;. Each one provides a piece of the puzzle: portability allows users to take their data and move to another platform; back-end interoperability lets users of upstart competitors interact with users of large platforms; and delegability allows users to interact with content from the big platforms through an interface of their choosing. All three address different ways that large platforms consolidate and guard their power. We’ll break these concepts down one at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data Portability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/what-we-mean-when-we-say-data-portability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data portability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is the idea that users can take their data from one service and do what they want with it elsewhere. Portability is the “low-hanging fruit” of interoperability policy. Many services, Facebook and Google included, already offer relatively robust data portability tools. Furthermore, data portability mandates have been included in several recent data privacy laws, including the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Portability is relatively uncontroversial, even for the companies subject to regulation. In 2019, Facebook published&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-and-data-portability/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a whitepaper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;supporting some legal portability mandates. For its part, Google has repeatedly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Data_Liberation_Front&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;led the way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with user-friendly portability tools. And Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Apple have all poured resources into the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatransferproject.dev/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data Transfer Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a set of technical standards to make data portability easier to implement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devil is in the details. Portability is hard at the edges, because assigning “ownership” to data is often hard. Who should have access to a photo that one person takes of another’s face, then uploads to a company’s server? Who should be able to download a person’s phone number: just the owner, or everyone they’re friends with on Facebook? It is extremely difficult for a single law to draw a bright line between what data a user is entitled to and what constitutes an invasion of another’s privacy. While creating portability mandates, regulators should avoid overly prescriptive orders that could end up hurting privacy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Users should have a right to data portability, but that alone won’t be enough to loosen the tech giants’ grip. That’s because portability helps users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;leave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;a platform but doesn’t help them communicate with others who still use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back-end Interoperability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second, more impactful concept is back-end interoperability. Specifically, this means enabling users to interact with one another across the boundaries of large platforms. Right now, you can create an account on any number of small social networks, like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://diasporafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;diaspora&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mastodon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But until your friends also move off of Facebook or Twitter, it’s extremely difficult to interact with them. Network effects prevent upstart competitors from taking off. Mandatory interoperability would force Facebook to maintain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that let users on other platforms exchange messages and content with Facebook users. For example, Facebook would have to let users of other networks post, like, comment, and send messages to users on Facebook without a Facebook account. This would enable true federation in the social media space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imagine a world where social media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;isn’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;controlled by a monopoly. There are dozens of smaller services that look kind of like Facebook, but each has its own policies and priorities. Some services maintain tight control over what kind of content is posted. Others allow pseudonymous members to post freely with minimal interference. Some are designed for, and moderated by, specific cultural or political communities. Some are designed to share and comment on images; others lend themselves better to microblogs; others still to long textual exchanges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now imagine that a user on one platform can interact with any of the other platforms through a single interface. Users on one service can engage freely with content hosted on other services, subject to the moderation policies of the hosting servers. They don’t need to sign up for accounts with each service if they don’t want to (though they are more than free to do so). Facebook doesn’t have an obligation to host or promote content that violates its rules, but it does have a duty to connect its users to people and pages of their choosing on other networks. If users don’t like how the moderators of one community run things, they can move somewhere else. That’s the promise of federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open technical standards to federate social networking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Social/WG&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;already exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and Facebook already maintains interfaces that do most of what the bill would require. But Facebook controls who can access its interfaces, and reserves the right to restrict or revoke access for any reason. Furthermore, Facebook requires that all of its APIs be accessed on behalf of a Facebook user, not a user of another service. It offers “interoperability” in one direction—flowing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Facebook—and it has no incentive to respect users who host their data elsewhere. An interoperability mandate, and appropriate enforcement, could solve both of these problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delegability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The third and final piece of the legislative framework is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;delegability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is the idea that a user can delegate a third-party company, or a piece of third-party software, to interact with a platform on their behalf. Imagine if you could read your Facebook feed as curated by a third party that you trust. You could see things in raw chronological order, or see your friends’ posts in a separate feed from the news and content companies that you follow. You could calibrate your own filters for hate speech and misinformation, if you chose. And you could assign a trusted third party to navigate Facebook’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/why-we-didnt-make-fix-my-facebook-privacy-settings-tool&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;twisted labyrinth of privacy settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for you, making sure you got the most privacy-protective experience by default.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A great deal of the problems caused by monopolistic platforms are due to their interfaces. Ad-driven tech companies use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/designing-welcome-mats-invite-user-privacy-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dark patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/02/how-twitters-default-settings-can-leak-your-phone-number&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;power of defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to get users’ “consent” for much of their rampant data collection. In addition, ad-driven platforms often curate information in ways that benefit advertisers, not users. The ways Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube present content are designed to maximize engagement and drive up quarterly earnings. This frequently comes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/04/when-you-look-into-the-news-feed-the-news-feed-looks-into-you/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the expense of user well-being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A legal mandate for delegability would require platforms to allow third-party software to interface with their systems in the same way users do. In other words, they would have to expose interfaces for common user interactions—sending messages, liking and commenting on posts, reading content, and changing settings—so that users could delegate a piece of software to do those things for them. At a minimum, it would mean that platforms can leave their tech the way it is—after all, these functions are already exposed through a user interface, and so may be automated—and stop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/facebook-v-power-ventures&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;suing companies that try to build on top of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. A more interventionist regulation could require platforms to maintain stable, usable APIs to serve this purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is probably the most interventionist of the three avenues of regulation. It also has the most potential to cause harm. If platforms are forced to create new interfaces and given only limited authority to moderate their use, Facebook and Twitter could become even more overrun with bots. In addition, any company that is able to act on a user’s behalf will have access to all of that person’s information. Safeguards need to be created to ensure that user privacy is not harmed by this kind of mandate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Security, Privacy, Interoperability: Choose All Three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability mandates are a heavy-duty regulatory tool. They need to be implemented carefully to avoid creating new problems with data privacy and security. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandates for interoperability and delegability have the potential to exacerbate the privacy problems of existing platforms. Cambridge Analytica acquired its hoard of user data through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-change-your-facebook-settings-opt-out-platform-api-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook’s existing APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. If we require Facebook to open those APIs to everyone, we need to make sure that the new data flows don’t lead to new data abuses. This will be difficult, but not impossible. The key is to make sure users have control. Under a new mandate, Facebook would have to open up APIs for competing companies to use, but no data should flow across company boundaries until users give explicit, informed consent. Users must be able to withdraw that consent easily, at any time. The data shared should be minimized to what is actually necessary to achieve interoperability. And companies that collect data through these new interoperable interfaces should not be allowed to monetize that data in any way, including using it to profile users for ads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability may also clash with security. Back-end interoperability will mean that big platforms need to keep their public-facing APIs stable, because changing them frequently or without notice could break the connections to other services. However, once a service becomes federated, it can be extremely difficult to change the way it works at all. Consider email, the archetypal federated messaging service. While end-to-end encryption has taken off on centralized messaging services like iMessage and WhatsApp, email servers have been slow to adopt even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/winding-down-starttls-everywhere-project-and-future-secure-email&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;basic, point-to-point encryption with STARTTLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s proven frustratingly difficult to get stakeholders on the same page, so inertia wins, and many messages are sent using the same technology we used in the ‘90s. Some encryption experts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;have stated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, credibly, that they believe federation makes it too “slow” to build a competitive encrypted messaging service.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But security doesn’t have to take a backseat to interoperability. In a world with interoperability mandates, standards don’t have to be decided by committee: the large platform that is subject to regulation can dictate how its services evolve, as long as it continues to grant fair access to everyone. If Facebook is to make its encrypted chat services interoperable with third parties, it must reserve the right to aggressively fix bugs and patch vulnerabilities. Sometimes, this will make it difficult for competitors to keep up, but protocol security is not something we can afford to sacrifice. Anyone who wants to be in the business of providing secure communications must be ready to tackle vulnerabilities quickly and according to industry best practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability mandates will present new challenges that we must take seriously. That doesn’t mean interoperability has to destroy privacy or undermine security. Lawmakers must be careful when writing new mandates, but they should diligently pursue a path that gives us interoperability without creating new risks for users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlocking Competitive Compatibility: Removing the Ceiling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability mandates could make a great floor for interoperability. By their nature, mandates are backward-looking, seeking to establish competitive ecosystems instead of incumbent monopolies. No matter how the designers of these systems strain their imaginations, they can never plan for the interoperability needs of all the future use-cases, technologies, and circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enter “competitive compatibility,” or ComCom, which will remove the artificial ceiling on innovation imposed by the big platforms.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A glance through the origin stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of technologies as diverse as cable TV, modems, the Web, operating systems, social media services, networks, printers, and even cigarette-lighter chargers for cellphones reveals that the technologies we rely on today were not established as full-blown, standalone products, but rather, they started as adjuncts to the incumbent technologies that they eventually grew to eclipse. When these giants were mere upstarts, they shouldered their way rudely into the market by adding features to existing, widely used products, without permission from the companies whose products they were piggybacking on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, this kind of bold action is hard to find, though when it’s tried,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/african-whatsapp-modders-are-masters-worldwide-adversarial-interoperability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;it’s a source of tremendous value for users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a real challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to the very biggest of the Big Tech giants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Competitive compatibility was never rendered obsolete. Rather, the companies that climbed up the ComCom ladder kicked that ladder away once they had comfortably situated themselves at the peak of their markets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They have accomplished this by distorting existing laws into anti-competitive doomsday devices. Whether it’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/facebook-v-power-ventures&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;turning terms of service violations into felonies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;making independent repair into a criminal copyright violation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;banning compatibility altogether&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/patents&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;turning troll with a portfolio of low-grade patents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it seems dominant firms are never more innovative than when they're finding ways to abuse the law to make it illegal to compete with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big Tech’s largely successful war on competitive compatibility reveals one of the greatest dangers presented by market concentration: its monopoly rents produce so much surplus that firms can afford to pursue the maintenance of their monopolies through the legal system, rather than by making the best products at the best prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;EFF has long advocated for reforms to software patents, anti-circumvention rules, cybersecurity law, and other laws and policies that harm users and undermine fundamental liberties. But the legal innovations on display in the war on competitive compatibility show that fixing every defective tech law is not guaranteed to restore a level playing field. The lesson of legal wars like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is that any ambiguity in any statute can be pressed into service to block competitors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all, patents, copyrights, cybersecurity laws, and other weapons in the monopolist’s arsenal were never intended to establish and maintain industrial monopolies. Their use as anti-competitive weapons is a warning that a myriad of laws can be used in this way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The barriers to competitive compatibility are many and various: there are explicitly enumerated laws, like section 1201 of the DMCA; then there are interpretations of those laws, like the claims that software patents cover very obvious &quot;inventions&quot; if the words &quot;with a computer&quot; are added to them; and then there are lawsuits to expand existing laws, like Oracle's bid to stretch copyright to cover APIs and other functional, non-copyrightable works. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are several ways to clear the path for would-be interoperators. These bad laws can be worked around or struck down, one at a time, through legislation or litigation. Legislators could also enshrine an affirmative right to interoperate in law that would future-proof against new legal threats. Furthermore, regulators could require that entities receiving government contracts, settling claims of anticompetitive conduct, or receiving permission to undertake mergers make binding covenants not to attack interoperators under&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;legal theory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Comprehensively addressing threats to competitive compatibility will be a long and arduous process, but the issue is urgent. It’s time we got started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articles_index&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/index.html&quot; title=&quot;The Desolation of Blog&quot;&gt;Articles index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 7 2020 by Jeff Johnson&lt;br/&gt;Support this blog: &lt;a href=&quot;https://underpassapp.com/LinkUnshortener/&quot;&gt;Link Unshortener&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/&quot;&gt;StopTheMadness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://underpassapp.com/&quot;&gt;Underpass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/JeffJohnsonWI&quot;&gt;PayPal.Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google Chrome's &quot;Cookies and site data&quot; settings, accessible via the Preferences menu item or directly with &lt;code&gt;chrome://settings/cookies&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar, you can enable the setting &quot;Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome&quot;. However, I've discovered that Chrome exempts Google's own sites, such as Search and YouTube, from this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/1.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I visit Apple's site, which sets some cookies and local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/2.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My settings allow only Twitter to keep site data, and you can see that all of the Apple data was deleted after quit and relaunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/3.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I visit YouTube, which sets some cookies and several other kinds of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/4.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I quit and relaunch, the cookies are deleted, but the database storage, local storage, and service workers are still there! (Did you know there are so many different kinds of web storage?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/5.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome respects the &quot;Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome&quot; setting for &lt;code&gt;apple.com&lt;/code&gt; but not entirely for &lt;code&gt;youtube.com&lt;/code&gt;. In order to prevent YouTube from saving data, you have to add it to &quot;Sites that can never use cookies&quot;. (Note that adding YouTube to &quot;Always clear cookies when windows are closed&quot; is not sufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/6.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I try visiting Google Search, which sets some cookies and local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/7.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After quit and relaunch, the cookies are deleted, but the local storage is still there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/8.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, to prevent this from happening, you have to add &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; to &quot;Sites that can never use cookies&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google-images/9.png&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;836&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is just a Google Chrome bug, not intentional behavior, but the question is why it only affects Google sites, not non-Google sites. I've tested using the latest Google Chrome version 86.0.4240.75 for macOS, but this behavior was also happening in the previous version of Chrome. I don't know when it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some people are going to read this article and say &quot;Use Safari instead of Chrome!&quot; But it's important to note that Safari doesn't even have the feature to clear site data on quit, so Safari is actually worse. In this respect, Safari is years behind. Firefox and all of the Chromium-based browsers already have the clear site data on quit feature.)&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;article__aside&quot; readability=&quot;27.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;layout-article-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;time itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/DateTime&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-10-17T00:00:00Z&quot; class=&quot;article__dateline-datetime&quot;&gt;Oct 17th 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p data-test-id=&quot;Dateline&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/dateline&quot; class=&quot;article__dateline-location&quot;&gt;ALMATY, ISTANBUL, KAMPALA, MEXICO CITY AND SÃO PAULO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;EOPLE WERE&lt;/small&gt; hungry during lockdown. So Francis Zaake, a Ugandan member of parliament, bought some rice and sugar and had it delivered to his neediest constituents. For this charitable act, he was arrested. Mr Zaake is a member of the opposition, and Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has ordered that only the government may hand out food aid. Anyone else who does so can be charged with murder, Mr Museveni has threatened, since they might do it in a disorderly way, attract crowds and thereby spread the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Zaake had been careful not to put his constituents at risk. Rather than having crowds converge on one place to pick up the food parcels, he had them delivered to people’s doors by motorbike-taxi. Nonetheless, the next day police and soldiers jumped over his fence while he was showering and broke into his house. They dragged him into a van and threw him in a cell. He says they beat, kicked and cut him, crushed his testicles, sprayed a blinding chemical into his eyes, called him a dog and told him to quit politics. He claims that one sneered: “We can do whatever we want to you or even kill you...No one will demonstrate for you because they are under lockdown.” The police say he inflicted the injuries on himself and is fishing for sympathy with foreign donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The charges against him were eventually dropped, but the message was clear. “The president doesn’t want the opposition to give out food,” says Mr Zaake, who walks with crutches and wears sunglasses to protect his eyes. “He knows that people will like us [if we do].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The pandemic has been terrible not only for the human body but also for the body politic. Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, counts 80 countries where the quality of democracy and respect for human rights have deteriorated since the pandemic began. The list includes both dictatorships that have grown nastier and democracies where standards have slipped. Only one country, Malawi, has improved (see map). Covid-19 “has fuelled a crisis for democracy around the world,” argue Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz of Freedom House. Global freedom has been declining since just before the financial crisis of 2007-08, by their reckoning. Covid-19 has accelerated this pre-existing trend in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The disease poses a grave and fast-moving threat to every nation. Governments have, quite reasonably, assumed emergency powers to counter it. But such powers can be abused. Governments have selectively banned protests on the grounds that they might spread the virus, silenced critics and scapegoated minorities. They have used emergency measures to harass dissidents. And they have taken advantage of a general atmosphere of alarm. With everyone’s attention on covid-19, autocrats and would-be autocrats in many countries can do all sorts of bad things, safe in the knowledge that the rest of the world will barely notice, let alone to object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Measuring the pandemic’s effect on democracy and human rights is hard. Without covid-19, would China’s rulers still have inflicted such horrors on Muslim Uyghurs this year? Would Thailand’s king have grabbed nearly absolute powers? Would Egypt have executed 15 political prisoners in a single weekend this month? Perhaps. But these outrages would surely have faced stronger opposition, both at home and abroad. Granted, the current American administration makes less fuss about human rights than previous ones have and covid-19 has not changed that. But the voice from the White House is not the only one that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Last year was a year of mass protests, which swept six continents, brought down five governments (Algeria, Bolivia, Iraq, Lebanon and Sudan) and forced others to rethink unpopular policies, as in Chile, France and Hong Kong. This year, by contrast, governments have banned mass gatherings to enforce social distancing. For many, this is wonderfully convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;For example, in India, the world’s largest democracy, the biggest campaign of civil resistance for decades erupted shortly before the pandemic. For 100 days protesters raged against proposed changes to citizenship laws that would discriminate against Muslims and potentially render millions of them stateless. These protests petered out after a curfew was imposed in response to covid-19, since it was no longer possible to occupy the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Later, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government began imposing strict local lockdowns, it singled out neighbourhoods which had held protests, many of which were Muslim. Heavy police barricades locked in residents for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In early September the government declared that in the upcoming parliamentary session there would be no Question Hour for the opposition and no private members’ bills—long-standing institutions that allow opposition &lt;small&gt;MP&lt;/small&gt;s to query the government directly. The excuse: the health risks of covid-19, along with assertions that in a crisis, legislative time was too precious to waste on noisy debate. The opposition walked out, allowing Mr Modi to ram through 25 bills in three days. He then suspended the session eight days early, having apparently forgotten the earlier excuse that time was short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;At the outset of the crisis Mr Modi, who has a knack for the theatrics of power, called on citizens to bang on pots, and later to light sacred lamps, in a show of solidarity to fight the pandemic. These displays, taken up by his supporters with glee, were not spontaneous expressions of support for doctors and nurses, like similar displays in Italy, Spain or Britain. Rather, they were a demonstration of Mr Modi’s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;H.L. Mencken, an American journalist, once wrote that “the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” He could have added that when people have real cause for alarm, they are even keener to be led to safety. Some put their trust in the sober calculations of evidence-driven experts. Others put their faith in strongmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Modi has racked up colossal approval ratings this year, even as he presides over a double catastrophe of mass death and economic slump. So has Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, despite the largest reported caseload in South-East Asia. Mr Duterte’s poll numbers may be coloured by fear; he has had thousands of people, supposedly criminal suspects, killed without trial, a campaign that appears to have intensified during the pandemic. But many Filipinos admire his grim style—extending a “state of calamity” for another year last month, temporarily banning many nurses from going to work overseas and vowing to try the first covid-19 vaccine himself to show it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Popular, you’re gonna be popular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Admiration for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s militaristic president, is as high as ever, despite over 5m covid-19 cases and more than 150,000 deaths. This is partly because he has handed out emergency aid to 67m hard-up Brazilians, but his macho posturing also appeals to many voters. He caught covid-19 and recovered, crediting his background as an athlete. He declared: “We have to face [the virus] like a man, damn it, not like a little boy.” He blames state governors for being so scared of the disease that they wreck people’s livelihoods unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;That strikes a chord with some. When São Paulo’s lockdown was at its tightest, a clothing shop was illegally letting customers in through a tiny metal shutter door. “The governors shut things down to hurt the economy and make Bolsonaro look bad,” grumbled the owner, who shared his president’s dismissive attitude towards covid-19. “The death numbers are a lie,” he said: “I’m only wearing this mask out of respect for our clients. I don’t need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Strongmen find it easier to impress the masses when they control the news. In April Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, counted 38 countries using the coronavirus as an excuse to harass critical media. That number has now more than doubled, to 91, says Freedom House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Many governments have criminalised “fake news” about the pandemic. Often, this means commentary that displeases the ruling party. Nicaragua’s regime plans to ban news that “causes alarm, fear or anxiety”. El Salvador has relaunched a state television outlet, having purged 70 journalists since President Nayib Bukele came to power last year. “I am watching a very balanced newscast,” grinned Mr Bukele. “I don’t know what the opposition will see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Anyone in Zimbabwe who publishes or disseminates “false” information about an official, or that impedes the response to the pandemic, faces up to 20 years in prison. Two journalists were arrested when they tried to visit in hospital three opposition activists, including an &lt;small&gt;MP&lt;/small&gt;, who had been abducted, tortured and forced to drink urine by ruling-party thugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;All around the world, ordinary people are being gagged, too. Some 116 citizen journalists are currently imprisoned, says Reporters Without Borders. In Uzbekistan people entering quarantine facilities have had to hand over their phones, supposedly to prevent the devices from spreading the virus but actually so they cannot take photos of the woeful conditions inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Medics, who see covid-19 fiascos close up, face extra pressure to shut up. China’s rulers silenced the doctors in Wuhan who first sounded the alarm about the new virus. Censorship can be lethal. Had China listened to doctors and acted faster to curb the disease, it would not have spread so fast around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Still, other regimes have copied China’s example. In September the Turkish Medical Association accused Turkey’s government of downplaying the outbreak. A ruling-party ally called for the group to be shut down and its leaders investigated for stoking “panic”. Yet the doctors were right. The health ministry later admitted that its daily figures did not include asymptomatic patients. An opposition lawmaker shared a document suggesting that the true number of cases in a single day in September was 19 times the official tally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Egypt’s government says it is coping admirably with the pandemic. A dozen doctors have been arrested for suggesting otherwise, as have several journalists. One, Mohamed Monir, died of covid-19 contracted during detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Of the 24 countries that had national elections scheduled between January and August, nine were disrupted by the pandemic. Some delays were justified. But as South Korea showed, a ballot can be held safely if suitable precautions are taken. Some other governments were in no hurry. Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament in March and did not allow fresh elections until August. In the meantime, he ran the country without lawmakers to check him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In Hong Kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in elections in September. Citing the risk of covid-19, the territory’s pro-communist leaders delayed them for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Burundi’s election in May was probably never going to be clean, but the virus supplied the perfect excuse to exclude pesky foreign observers. Twelve days before the election they were told that they would have to quarantine on arrival in the country for 14 days, thus missing the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In Russia Vladimir Putin has turned the virus to his advantage. He shifted responsibility for a strict lockdown to regional governors, but then took credit for easing it. In the summer he held a constitutional pseudo-referendum to allow himself to stay in office until 2036. Citing public health, he extended the vote to a week and allowed people to vote at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. The vote was impossible to observe or verify. Mr Putin declared a resounding victory. Parliament voted to change the voting procedure permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In countries with too few checks and balances, rules to curb the virus can be used for other ends. On a dark road in Senegal, a policeman recently stopped a taxi and detained the driver for wearing his anti-covid mask on his chin. After 45 minutes, shaking with fury, the driver returned to his vehicle. The cop had threatened him with dire punishments unless he handed over some cash, he explained to his passenger, a reporter for &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt;. He drove off as fast as he could, cursing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;While petty officials abuse the rules to pad their wages, strongmen typically abuse them to crush dissent. Police assaulted civilians in 59 countries and detained them in 66 for reasons linked to the pandemic. Violence was most common in countries Freedom House classifies as “partly free”, where people are not yet too scared to protest, but their rulers would like them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In Zimbabwe, for example, many of the 34 new regulations passed during a national lockdown are still in place, and have been used as a pretext for myriad abuses. In September the Zimbabwe Human Rights &lt;small&gt;NGO&lt;/small&gt; Forum, an umbrella group, released a report listing 920 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, unlawful arrests and assaults on citizens by the security services in the first 180 days of lockdown. One man was forced to roll around in raw sewage. Many had dogs set on them. Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested or beaten, including a former finance minister. There were too many everyday cases of intimidation and harassment to count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Many strongmen are also chipping away at pre-pandemic checks on their power. Nicaragua has borrowed an idea from Mr Putin: a law will require &lt;small&gt;NGO&lt;/small&gt;s that receive foreign funding to register as “foreign agents”. India used similar rules to shut down the local arm of Amnesty International, which closed in September after its bank accounts were frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In Kazakhstan trials are taking place on Zoom, leading some defendants in politically charged cases to complain that this makes it easy for judges to have selective hearing. Alnur Ilyashev, a pro-democracy campaigner who was sentenced to three years of restricted movement for “disseminating false information”, said he could not always hear his own trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nothing spreads like fear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Panic about a contagious disease makes people irrational and xenophobic. A study in 2015 by Huggy Rao of Stanford University and Sunasir Dutta of the University of Minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu. Many autocrats, even if they have not read the academic literature, grasp that blaming out-groups is a good way to win support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Modi’s government tars Muslims as superspreaders. Bulgaria imposed harsher lockdowns on Romany neighbourhoods than on others. Turkey’s religious authorities blame gay people. Malaysian officials blame migrant workers, some of whom have been caned and deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Minorities have had an especially grim time in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto president, threatened severe penalties for residents who re-enter the country illegally. People understood this to refer to the Rohingyas, a persecuted Muslim group, roughly 1m of whom have fled into neighbouring countries. The rumour that Rohingyas were infecting the nation spread rapidly. A cartoon circulating online showed a Rohingya man, labelled as an “illegal interloper”, crossing the border, carrying covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, a &lt;small&gt;UN&lt;/small&gt; rapporteur warns that the pandemic has “emboldened” Myanmar’s army, which has stepped up its war on secessionists. The Arakan Army, a rebel group, offered ceasefires in April, June and September; all were rebuffed. In May and June the army bombed civilians, razed villages and tortured non-combatants, says Amnesty International. Some 200,000 have fled to camps for displaced people, according to a local &lt;small&gt;NGO&lt;/small&gt;, the Rakhine Ethnics Congress. Since covid-19 struck, donations have declined and supplies of food to the camps have dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Abusers and autocrats have not had it all their own way this year. The pandemic has drained their treasuries. Their finances will still be wobbly even when a vaccine is found and the public-health excuse for curbs on freedom is no longer plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;And people are pushing back. Although 158 countries have imposed restrictions on demonstrations, big protests have erupted in at least 90 since the pandemic began. Furious crowds in Kyrgyzstan this month forced the government to order a re-run of a tainted election. Protests in Nigeria prompted the government to disband a notoriously torture-and-murder-prone police unit on October 11th. Mass rallies in Belarus have so far failed to reverse a rigged election there, but have made it clear that the dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, has lost the consent of his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Institutions are pushing back, too. A court in Lesotho barred the prime minister from using the virus as an excuse to close parliament. Russia’s opposition parties refuse to be cowed even by the poisoning of their main leader, Alexei Navalny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;With luck, when covid-19 eventually recedes, the global atmosphere of fear will recede with it. People may find the capacity to care a bit more about abuses that occur far away, or to people unlike themselves. They may even elect leaders who speak up for universal values. But for the time being, the outlook is grim.&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure</title>
<link>https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we’ve gotten exceptionally good at building large, complex software systems. We’re now starting to see the rise of massive, complex systems built around data – where the primary business value of the system comes from the analysis of data, rather than the software directly. We’re seeing quick-moving impacts of this trend across the industry, including the emergence of new roles, shifts in customer spending, and the emergence of new startups providing infrastructure and tooling around data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of today’s fastest growing infrastructure startups build products to manage data. These systems enable data-driven decision making (&lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; systems) and drive data-powered products, including with machine learning (&lt;em&gt;operational&lt;/em&gt; systems). They range from the pipes that carry data, to storage solutions that house data, to SQL engines that analyze data, to dashboards that make data easy to understand – from data science and machine learning libraries, to automated data pipelines, to data catalogs, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite all of this energy and momentum, we’ve found that there is still a tremendous amount of confusion around what technologies are on the leading end of this trend and how they are used in practice. In the last two years, we talked to hundreds of founders, corporate data leaders, and other experts – including interviewing 20+ practitioners on their current data stacks – in an attempt to codify emerging best practices and draw up a common vocabulary around data infrastructure. This post will begin to share the results of that work and showcase technologists pushing the industry forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Massive Growth of the Data Infrastructure Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary motivations for this report is the furious growth data infrastructure has undergone over the last few years. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/document/code/726997&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt;, data infrastructure spending hit a record high of $66 billion in 2019, representing 24% – and growing – of all infrastructure software spend. The top 30 data infrastructure startups have raised over $8 billion of venture capital in the last 5 years at an aggregate value of $35 billion, per Pitchbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Venture capital raised by select data infrastructure startups 2015-2020&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race towards data is also reflected in the job market. Data analysts, data engineers, and machine learning engineers topped &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/emerging-jobs-report/Emerging_Jobs_Report_U.S._FINAL.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Linkedin’s list&lt;/a&gt; of fastest-growing roles in 2019. Sixty percent of the Fortune 1000 employ Chief Data Officers according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://newvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewVantage-Partners-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey-2020-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NewVantage Partners&lt;/a&gt;, up from only 12% in 2012, and these companies substantially outperform their peers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/catch-them-if-you-can-how-leaders-in-data-and-analytics-have-pulled-ahead#interactive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;McKinsey’s growth and profitability studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, data (and data systems) are contributing directly to business results – not only in Silicon Valley tech companies but also in traditional industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Unified Data Infrastructure Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the energy, resources, and growth of the data infrastructure market, the tools and best practices for data infrastructure are also evolving incredibly quickly. So much so, it’s difficult to get a cohesive view of how all the pieces fit together. And that’s what we set out to provide some insight into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked practitioners from leading data organizations: (a) what their internal technology stacks looked like, and (b) whether it would differ if they were to build a new one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of these discussions was the following reference architecture diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified Architecture for Data Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going on in this architecture – far more than you’d find in most production systems. It’s an attempt to provide a full picture of a unified architecture across all use cases. And while the most sophisticated users may have something approaching this, most do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post is focused on providing more clarity on this architecture and how it is most commonly realized in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analytics, AI/ ML, and the Great Convergence?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data infrastructure serves two purposes at a high level: to help business leaders make better decisions through the use of data (analytic use cases) and to build data intelligence into customer-facing applications, including via machine learning (operational use cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two parallel ecosystems have grown up around these broad use cases. The data warehouse forms the foundation of the analytics ecosystem. Most data warehouses store data in a structured format and are designed to quickly and easily generate insights from core business metrics, usually with SQL (although Python is growing in popularity). The data lake is the backbone of the operational ecosystem. By storing data in raw form, it delivers the flexibility, scale, and performance required for bespoke applications and more advanced data processing needs. Data lakes operate on a wide range of languages including Java/Scala, Python, R, and SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these technologies has religious adherents, and building around one or the other turns out to have a significant impact on the rest of the stack (more on this later). But what’s really interesting is that modern data warehouses and data lakes are starting to resemble one another – both offering commodity storage, native horizontal scaling, semi-structured data types, ACID transactions, interactive SQL queries, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key question going forward: are data warehouses and data lakes are on a path toward convergence? That is, are they becoming interchangeable in the stack? Some experts believe this is taking place and driving simplification of the technology and vendor landscape. Others believe parallel ecosystems will persist due to differences in languages, use cases, or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Architectural Shifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data infrastructure is subject to the broad architectural shifts happening across the software industry including the move to cloud, open source, SaaS business models, and so on. However, in addition to those, there are a number of shifts that are unique to data infrastructure. They are driving the architecture forward and often destabilizing markets (like ETL tooling) in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emerging Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of new data capabilities are also emerging that necessitate a new set of tools and core systems. Many of these trends are creating new technology categories – and markets – from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blueprints for Building Modern Data Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the architecture as actionable as possible, we asked experts to codify a set of common “blueprints” – implementation guides for data organizations based on size, sophistication, and target use cases and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll provide a high-level overview of three common blueprints here. We start with the blueprint for &lt;em&gt;modern business intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, which focuses on cloud-native data warehouses and analytics use cases. In the second blueprint, we look at &lt;em&gt;multimodal data processing&lt;/em&gt;, covering both analytic and operational use cases built around the data lake. In the final blueprint, we zoom into operational systems and the emerging components of the &lt;em&gt;AI and ML&lt;/em&gt; stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Three common blueprints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blueprint 1: Modern Business Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud-native business intelligence for companies of all sizes – easy to use, inexpensive to get started, and more scalable than past data warehouse patterns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09.jpg?ssl=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-301513 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973-1024x765.jpg?resize=1024%2C765&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Modern BI Blueprint&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;765&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=1024%2C765&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=768%2C574&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=1536%2C1148&amp;amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=125%2C93&amp;amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=442%2C330&amp;amp;ssl=1 442w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?resize=843%2C630&amp;amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7-09-e1602789723973.jpg?w=1667&amp;amp;ssl=1 1667w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://7a9z42689xx35658r1hutm8n-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click here for a high-res version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is increasingly the &lt;strong&gt;default option&lt;/strong&gt; for companies with relatively small data teams and budgets. Enterprises are also increasingly migrating from legacy data warehouses to this blueprint – taking advantage of cloud flexibility and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core &lt;strong&gt;use cases&lt;/strong&gt; include reporting, dashboards, and ad-hoc analysis, primarily using SQL (and some Python) to analyze structured data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths&lt;/strong&gt; of this pattern include low up-front investment, speed and ease of getting started, and wide availability of talent. This blueprint is &lt;strong&gt;less appropriate&lt;/strong&gt; for teams that have more complex data needs – including extensive data science, machine learning, or streaming/ low latency applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blueprint 2: Multimodal Data Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolved data lakes supporting both analytic and operational and use cases – also known as modern infrastructure for Hadoop refugees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://7a9z42689xx35658r1hutm8n-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click here for a high-res version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is found most often in large enterprises and tech companies with &lt;strong&gt;sophisticated, complex data needs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use cases&lt;/strong&gt; include both business intelligence and more advanced functionality – including operational AI/ ML, streaming/ latency-sensitive analytics, large-scale data transformations, and processing of diverse data types (including text, images, and video) – using an array of languages (Java/Scala, Python, SQL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths&lt;/strong&gt; of this pattern include the flexibility to support diverse applications, tooling, user-defined functions, and deployment contexts – and it holds a cost advantage for large datasets. This blueprint is &lt;strong&gt;less appropriate&lt;/strong&gt; for companies that just want to get up and running or have smaller data teams – maintaining it requires significant time, money, and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blueprint 3: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An all-new, work-in-progress stack to support robust development, testing, and operation of machine learning models&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://7a9z42689xx35658r1hutm8n-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Data-Report-Martin-Inline-Graphics-R7.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click here for a high-res version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;companies doing machine learning&lt;/strong&gt; already use some subset of the technologies in this pattern. Heavy ML shops often implement the full blueprint, even relying on in-house development for new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core &lt;strong&gt;use cases&lt;/strong&gt; focus on data-powered capabilities for both internal and customer-facing applications – run either online (i.e., in response to user input) or in batch mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;strength&lt;/strong&gt; of this approach – as opposed to pre-packaged ML solutions – is full control over the development process, generating greater value for users and building AI/ ML as a core, long-term capability. This blueprint is &lt;strong&gt;less appropriate&lt;/strong&gt; for companies that are only testing ML, using it for lower-scale, internal use cases, or opting to rely on vendors – doing machine learning at scale is among the most challenging data problems today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data infrastructure is undergoing rapid, fundamental changes at an architectural level. Building out a modern data stack involves a diverse and ever-proliferating set of choices. And making the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; choices is more important now than ever, as we continue to shift from software based purely on code to systems that combine code and data to deliver value. Effective data capabilities are now table stakes for companies across all sectors – and winning at data can deliver durable competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this post can act as a guidepost to help data organizations understand the current state of the art, implement an architecture that best fits the needs of their businesses, and plan for the future amid continued evolution in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure</og:title>
<og:description>Five years ago, if you were building a system, it was a result of the code you wrote. Now, it’s built around the data that is fed into that system. And a new class of tools and technologies have emerged to process data for both analytics and operational AI/ ML.</og:description>

<title>Analyzing the Design of Unusual Japanese Butter Tableware</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.core77.com/posts/102355/Analyzing-the-Design-of-Unusual-Japanese-Butter-Tableware</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;aa467_2759&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;aa467_2759_t3&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-image-width=&quot;500&quot; data-image-height=&quot;500&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1105434&quot; src=&quot;https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/1105434_81_102355_TrnbTnIx_.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em id=&quot;27eb9d_7872&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Why is this shaped like this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;65c47f_4762&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;57dc68_4603&quot;&gt;Let's talk about two things that used to not go together: Japan and butter. Like other East Asian cultures, butter was never a part of the traditional Japanese diet, and was actually treated with disgust when introduced by Europeans in the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7927b2_318&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;fe5b8a_1151&quot;&gt;(Fun politically-incorrect fact: When living in Japan, I learned that the word &quot;butter&quot; was used in an outdated anti-foreigner slur. Both Westerners and overtly Western things were referred to as &lt;em&gt;bata-kusai&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;kusai&quot; being Japanese for &quot;stink.&quot; It was thought that eating butter produced uniquely European body odor, hence the slur was &quot;butter stinkers.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;1b2f8c_655&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;6c9039_4640&quot;&gt;Today Japan has accepted butter (particularly where baked goods and confectionaries are concerned). Uptake isn't as brisk as in America or butter-crazy France, but it's produced locally (in the Hokkaido region) and consumed in enough quantities that the country experiences occasional butter shortages, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/18/japans-exhausted-cows-shortage-butter-christmas&quot; rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;this one in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;31e699_16&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;5b66cb_5025&quot;&gt;I believe it's just us Yanks that shape butter into sticks. Which explains why Japanese butter dishes look strange and wide-bodied to Americans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;b5b273_543&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;724727_981&quot;&gt;My speculation--and this is based purely on the year I spent living there, during which time I witnessed fantastically anal-retentive table manners--is that a) This is for those who don't want to grate the surface of their butter, which probably gets messy as you work your way down through the slab, and b) this satisfies the Japanese need for order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;def244_497&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;9db340_6695&quot;&gt;In other words, for us Americans who want a pat of butter, we just cut one from the stick; but for Japanese users faced with a slab, a crosswise slice would be too unwieldy to balance on your average butter knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9c806b_1060&quot; data-ic-marker=&quot;321b13_1753&quot;&gt;An alternative would be to cut more manageable diagonal slices--i.e. cut a corner off of the slab--but I'm guessing a slab of butter with 45-degree angles cut into it would be too visually chaotic for Japanese sensibilities. This &quot;tool&quot; leaves behind an orderly 90-degree cut.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Analyzing the Design of Unusual Japanese Butter Tableware - Core77</og:title>
<og:description>Why is this shaped like this? Let's talk about two things that used to not go together: Japan and butter. Like other East Asian cultures, butter was never a part of the traditional Japanese diet, and was actually treated with disgust when introduced by Europeans in the 19th century. (Fun</og:description>
