&lt;h3&gt;Covid-19 IgM/IgG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoronaCheck is a rapid test for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) that delivers a result in ~10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of action is the qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a fingerstick blood specimen as an aid in the determination of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional Use Only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Important Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For profesional use only.&lt;/strong&gt;  Positive results are indicative of current or prior infection. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoronaCheck Covid-19 antibody (IgM/IgG) test kit is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing can be completed in less than 10 minutes.   A fingerstick blood specimen is required.     The easy-to-use test kit comes with a test cartridge, buffer solution, lancet and pipette. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_8 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use lancet device to obtain a drop of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collect blood using pipette (provided).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop 1 drop (10 ul) of blood onto test strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_1_4 et_pb_column_11 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_10 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add 2 drops of buffer solution into well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_1_4 et_pb_column_12 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_11 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait approximately 5-10 minutes until indicator line is visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_row et_pb_row_8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_3_5 et_pb_column_17 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HOW IT WORKS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of antibody imunoglobulin G and imunoglobulin M (IgG and IgM) proteins produced by the immune system indentify an infected person as soon as 5 days after exposure.  The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies are indicated by a red line in the specific region indicated on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_2_5 et_pb_column_18 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child&quot;&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_row et_pb_row_9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_19 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>MIT to no longer consider SAT subject tests in admissions decisions</title>
<link>https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-special-announcement-about-sat-subject-tests/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-special-announcement-about-sat-subject-tests/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT has made the decision to no longer consider the SAT Subject Tests as part of the admissions process. You can read about our revised testing requirements &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/tests-scores/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce our decision to discontinue the use of subject tests starting with the 2020-21 admissions cycle for first-year and transfer admissions (for students entering MIT in 2021 and beyond). We made this decision after considerable study, in consultation with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/committee-undergraduate-admissions-and-financial-aid&quot;&gt;faculty policy committee&lt;/a&gt;. We believe this decision will improve access for students applying to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are answers to some questions you may have about our change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you still require the SAT or the ACT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to require the SAT or the ACT, because our research has shown these tests, in combination with a student’s high school grades and coursework, are predictive of success in our challenging curriculum. While we know these tests are not perfect, they do provide an informative and consistent measure of a student’s academic potential in a world where high school experiences vary so widely, and they allow us to admit students from across the country — and the globe — who we are confident will thrive and succeed at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I took the subject tests. Can I submit my scores for your consideration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: in fairness to all applicants, we won’t consider them for anyone. We think it would be unfair to consider scores only from those who have scored well and therefore choose to send them to us. They are neither recommended nor optional; they are simply not a part of our process anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this apply to international students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International students will not have to take SAT subject tests, but we will require all students to take either the SAT or ACT. In addition, for non-native English speakers, we strongly recommend taking the TOEFL if you have been using English for less than 5 years or do not speak English at home or in school, so that we may consider that alongside the SAT or the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that this change will allow students to focus more on the things that matter to them while still preserving our ability to evaluate the academic preparedness of every applicant through other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last, but certainly not least: I know we are making this announcement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had already been planning to make this change, and decided to announce as soon as possible in part because we wanted to make sure no one was spending more time or energy studying for tests they wouldn’t have to take for us, especially during a public health emergency. As we’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mits-covid-19-precautions-and-its-impact-on-admissions/&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, your focus right now should be on your health, and the health of your community, and not worrying about college applications. Your health and happiness is in our hearts; stay safe, and talk more soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Extending on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://why.degree/about/&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;, I want to emphasise even more the importance of creating personal projects, having independent work and going far beyond what a degree might teach you. Just so that we are on the same page, I will not take into consideration the reason for choosing a Computer Science degree, nor the money aspect of doing a degree, but rather I will assume only that you &lt;strong&gt;are doing&lt;/strong&gt; a Computer Science degree and my focus will be on how to make the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer world has evolved a lot in 50 years and computers, with everything they entail, are nowadays easy to use; take for example GUIs for art designing or forums for programming erros. That is why the Computer Science degrees also adapted and stopped teaching irrelevant topics, such as Fortran (an old programming language) or MS-DOS (an outdated operating system). The currently taught topics make use of the most significant advantacements in technology and free students from some of those old pains. Nevertheless, degrees seem to lack lectures on fundamental skills in programming and in dealing with machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are important things the degrees &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; teach, and those are mainly related to basic concepts of algorithms and data structures, architecture, databases and networks. They also teach compilers and security, so one gets a good grasp of various relevant fields and can definitely do more with computers than simply plugging together a couple of cables. However, that is the apparent safety net we do not want to find ourselves in, at least for two reasons: &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt;, this knowledge may not even be useful in an actual job, as all the trivia you know is general and possibly long disregarded in the industry, and &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt;, graduates from Physics or Engineering are competing with you for all the tech jobs, because they require the same amount of job training, while potentially having a stronger analytical side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you fight against the two problems mentioned above? How do you use the advantage you have by having done a Computer Science degree when going into Software Engineering? After all, you must have an advantage, in the same way Medical students have an easier time becoming medics and Law students have an easier time becoming lawyers. What do you need to do to make sure that the Computer Science degree prepares you for a career in Computer Science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;******&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I attended an interview with Tim Berners-Lee. Besides finding out about crucial decisions he has made in his life and in developing the internet of today, I also gained a simple piece of advice that could not have been better targetted for this whole blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Build stuff. Don’t just study stuff, build stuff!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that you need to study for your &lt;em&gt;History of Programming Languages&lt;/em&gt; course in order to get a good grade and finish your degree successfully, but that does not mean you should devote your whole time for that. Similar to everyone else, a programmer gets experience practising; in this case that is programming. If you want to be a software engineer and you do not have any code to present in an interview, you can not call yourself a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of resources out there; we have reached the century when people pursue free online degrees and end up with the same level of expertise as any fresh grad. More than that, it is even possible to skip the degrees altogether and land any job based on a portofolio. Personally, I would not be able to achieve that due to my lack of motivation, and that is why I have chosen a degree - I have decided to pay for someone else to help me learn things. Yet it turns out that all the money in the world can not buy me a portofolio builder. It is still up to me to bite the bullet and start practising, as that is the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Computer Science degree teaches you how to teach yourself, that is not enough if you want to become an expert. You have to apply that teaching and test that theory in practice. The group projects organised by the uni have always been a joke, thus it is time to work on a serious project by yourself. Finally, I would like to encourage you to think about how you treat your degree, and even more realistically, the beginning of your career. Do the problem sheets and the programming exercises, but understand that those are only a baseline and the real world is more than just a textbook. Go to hackathons, get involved in open source and stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;STUDENT ALLEGEDLY PERFORMS ~50 UNOFFICIAL COVID-19 TESTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;~~A FOHO EXCLUSIVE~~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Stanford student ran ~50 unofficial COVID-19 tests for Stanford affiliates from his research lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he confirmed to FoHo on Wednesday. FoHo sources and messages obtained by FoHo confirmed that he was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;offering under-the-table tests to friends who were otherwise unable to access them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;his research lab had access to the necessary reagents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he told FoHo, he was &lt;strong&gt;able to independently perform the tests&lt;/strong&gt;. He began &lt;strong&gt;offering them to friends as well as friends of friends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;two undergraduate students wrote that they were tested through a non-standard testing procedure by a friend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;access to extra testing materials&lt;/strong&gt;, according to GroupMe messages obtained by FoHo. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;student confirmed that he was the person who tested the two undergrads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another case, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;student offered a “contraband” COVID-19 test to a friend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, according to a text message obtained by FoHo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student told FoHo that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;after two Stanford affiliates initially tested positive through his unofficial COVID-19 test, they later tested positive through an official test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It is &lt;strong&gt;unclear whether these students were included in any of Stanford’s official counts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Risky hack could double access to ventilators</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdm53/this-risky-hack-could-double-access-to-ventilators-as-coronavirus-peaks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdm53/this-risky-hack-could-double-access-to-ventilators-as-coronavirus-peaks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An emergency medicine physician says she and a colleague invented a way to connect four patients to a single ventilator, a hack that could significantly increase the capacity of overburdened hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors Greg Neyman and Charelene Irvin Babcock &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1197/j.aem.2006.05.009&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published a pilot study of the technique in &lt;em&gt;Academic Emergency Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. Babock is now an emergency medicine physician at a hospital in Detroit, Michigan and posted a YouTube video on March 14 describing the technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, many healthcare providers are struggling with a situation where they may have more than one patient needing ventilation and not enough ventilators to go around,” Babcock said in the video. “That’s why I’m putting this YouTube together. So I can show you how to modify one ventilator to ventilate more than one patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Motherboard, Babcock said that actually using it on coronavirus patients is a tough call, but a potentially life-saving one in a last-resort situation. These types of decisions—about who to treat and who to let die—are being made daily by doctors in Italy, and experts worry American hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she’s not sure if she’d use the technique herself if she ran out of ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That would be a true test,” she said. “Let’s say 10 people are dying in front of you and you have one ventialtor. That’s a tough call. I would talk to the family of the four best candidates and say, ‘Look, I could let three of you die or I could try all four, [but] we’re rolling the dice. It hasn’t been done before. And if it doesn’t work, we’re going to have to take three off, but this is probably the only chance they have of trying to survive.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is remarkably simple. “Four sets of standard ventilator tubing were connected to a single ventilator via two flow splitters,” the study said. “Each flow splitter was constructed of three Briggs T-Tubes which included connection adapters with the valves removed.” In Babock’s video, she said the adapters were 22mm in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, any kind of T-shaped tube can be adapted to extend the ventilator to more than one patient. Babock’s video has gone viral, and she told Motherboard in a phone interview that she put together the four way adapter set in her YouTube video in 15 minutes using supplies her hospital already had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her family urged her to share her knowledge with the world. Doctors in Italy are already having to make agonizing decisions about who to treat and who to send home; American doctors warn that we could soon face the same problems here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s only been done in test lungs,” she said over the phone. “But it’s probably better than nothing in dire circumstances. We don’t know how bad it’s gonna get. [Italy] is so overwhelmed with people that will die without ventilators and they don’t have enough ventilators. Sometimes trying something almost MacGyverish is better than doing nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both her YouTube video and during our interview, Babock urged caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It hasn’t been studied in humans, but it has been studied in test lungs and animals with normal lungs,” she said. “In this particular infection, the lungs are not normal. That’s where most of the pathology is...so a lot of the dynamics will change substantially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, a modified ventilator was able to properly intubate four sets of simulated lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has not been tested in humans,” Babcock said in the video. “But it has been used on humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, patients overwhelmed the local emergency room. Doctor Kevin Menes was working in the emergency room that day, remembered the study, and used it to save lives when the hospital ran out of ventilators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What he came up with was that if you have two people who are roughly the same size and tidal volume, you can just double the tidal volume and stick them on Y tubing on one ventilator,” Menes &lt;a href=&quot;https://epmonthly.com/article/not-heroes-wear-capes-one-las-vegas-ed-saved-hundreds-lives-worst-mass-shooting-u-s-history/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote of his experience in Emergency Physicians Monthly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different patients have different lung capacities, which means you can’t just hook up random patients to the same ventilator. “You want to make sure the lung sizes are the same on all four portions of the cycle,” Babcock said in her video. “You wouldn't want to put a pediatric patient with an adult patient because that wouldn’t make sense. It wouldn’t be able to make sure the same volume is delivered everywhere appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of tubing has to match, the size of the patient's lung capacity needs to match, and there’s always a danger of cross contamination between patients. “Likewise, you want to make sure the resistance is the same. You wouldn’t want to put a patient with severe bronchospasm [sudden contractions of bronchial muscles in the lungs] with a patient that does not have bronchospasm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Barefoot—a physician's assistant (PA) and former chief PA at the Trauma and Surgical Critical Care service in Columbia, South Carolina—told Motherboard in an email that the Neyman/Babcock method looked good in theory, but needed to be practiced with caution. Barefoot pointed out that the Las Vegas shootings victims were trauma patients who didn’t need long term ventilation. The same isn’t true of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the patients that are suffering from COVID-19 are having to be ventilated for over a week in many cases,” Barefoot said. “Ideally, the patients that would be grouped together would be of similar disease pattern, body habitus and with similar premorbid health status ...a mode of ventilation should fit the patient, not the other way around. Each person will interact with a ventilator differently and it is hard to individualize care among four patients with one ventilator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babcock isn’t ignoring these dangers and she agreed with Barefoot’s assessment. “This is off label use of the ventilator,” she said in the video. “The ventilator is made for one person...I always hope you would never need to use it in this way but you can never predict what will happen in a disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babcock works at St. John’s Ascension hospital in Detroit Michigan and said that, at the moment, they’re accommodating every patient just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a big city like Detroit, we’re prepared for a disaster situation. We have a cache of emergency ventilators available,” she said. “ Now I can’t guarantee we’re not going to go past that. But right now, we have a lot of capability...right now, at St. John’s, I’m not worried about not having a ventilator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In an ideal world, we wouldn't need to use this today or tomorrow. In an ideal world we could potentially look at studying an animal and figuring out what are the potential applications that make it better suited for a [respiratory distress syndrome] model,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t an ideal world and Babcock said she couldn’t not share what she knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Saying nothing when I know this information would not have been the right thing to do,” she said. “I hope I’ve pointed out the caveats...but I think it’s worthwhile to start a discussion about alternative ways to save lives using what we have now.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;No-one came to meet Catherine Hamlin the day she arrived at a tiny airport in Ethiopia in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 years later, the news of the Australian gynaecologist’s death at the age of 96 was met with an outpouring of grief in the country she had made her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because of the work Dr Hamlin - along with her late husband, Reginald - did transforming and, in some cases, saving the lives of tens of thousands of women who had been cast out of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating obstetric fistulas - a preventable injury sustained in childbirth that leaves women incontinent and can lead to other infections - would become her life’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are the women most to be pitied in the world,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/16/opinion/alone-and-ashamed.html?auth=linked-google&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Dr Hamlin told the New York Times in 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're alone in the world, ashamed of their injuries. For lepers, or Aids victims, there are organisations that help. But nobody knows about these women or helps them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26466652&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;The 'cursed' women living in shame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elinor Catherine Nicholson was born in Sydney in 1924, one of six children. She decided to train to be a doctor because she wanted to help women and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she completed her training, she began work at Crown Street Women’s Hospital, where she met a doctor from New Zealand, Reginald Hamlin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were married in 1950, and had a son, Richard, two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'We never came back'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the two wanted to go and work in a developing nation, and one day an advert in British medical journal The Lancet caught their eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It just read 'gynaecologist wanted in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa',&quot; Dr Hamlin told the BBC in 2016. It was enough to pique their interest, and the couple applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We felt we would like to do something to help people in the world, because we had had so many advantages,&quot; Dr Hamlin explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to stay for a couple of years. &quot;But we never came back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they set off from Sydney, sending a cable from the middle of the Indian Ocean to let their new colleagues know of their imminent arrival. It didn’t quite go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The cable didn’t get there until three weeks after we did, so there was nobody to meet us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they soon settled in, and it wasn’t long before they began to notice a number of women with a condition they had never seen before: obstetric fistula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were touched and appalled by the sadness of our first fistula patient: a beautiful young woman in urine-soaked ragged clothes, sitting alone in our outpatients department away from the other waiting patients,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/23/fistula-women-ethiopia&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Dr Hamlin later recalled to the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We knew she was more in need than any of the others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two million women live with the condition globally, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without help, many die. Those who survive - like the woman in the waiting room - are left with injuries that leave them incontinent, sometimes heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia many were left with a deep sense of shame. They found themselves banished to the outskirts of their communities, abandoned by their husbands. The stigma and social isolation led some to end their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'I felt so happy'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Hamlins knew it was both fixable and preventable - as they told Ethiopia's then ruler, Haile Selassie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He said, why do my women get this terrible thing where they can’t control their body waste?&quot; Dr Hamlin told the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We said, it is nothing to do with your women, it is to do with your lack of doctors in the countryside when they need to have a Caesarian section.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mamitu Gashe was one of the women who Dr Hamlin and her husband treated in the early days, when they worked at Princess Teshai Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 1962, and Mamitu had suffered a fistula giving birth to her first child. It was a three-day labour, and the baby did not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like so many other women in Ethiopia, she was left incontinent. But she had a sister in the capital, and her family took her to the city to find help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then they discovered the Hamlins’ specialist ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As soon as I arrived there, they treated me with compassion and I started to feel much better,&quot; she told the BBC after she was named one of the BBC's 100 Women 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They told me that I was not the only one suffering from this, that other women had this. As soon as they said that, I felt hopeful, I felt so happy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46225037&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;BBC 100 Women 2018: Who is on the list?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Hamlins would not only help repair the damage; they also gave Mamitu - who has no formal education - a new career: she is now an internationally respected fistula surgeon, having been taught by the Hamlins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I couldn’t read or write,&quot; she explained in 2018. &quot;Everything I knew, I knew from the Hamlins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mamitu was one of the staff members the Hamlins took to Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital when it opened in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'She broke our hearts'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, Dr Hamlin lost her beloved husband. Faced with a choice to stay or leave, she decided her work was not yet done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following years, the Hamlin Foundation opened five rural hospitals offering healthcare to women, as well as a facility for long-term care patients. Then, in 2007, Dr Hamlin saw one of her initial dreams finally fulfilled: the Hamlin College of Midwives opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

Her mother had been looking after her, thinking perhaps that the urine would dry up. She was in a state of malnutrition, 22kg (48lb), as she was carried on the back of her poor old mother, coming into the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She broke our hearts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34908233&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Fighting fistula: Razia's brave recovery from pregnancy nightmare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, Dr Hamlin continued her fight for the women of Ethiopia to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Ethiopia's Nobel Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed handed her a prestigious citizenship award - one of many she was given during her lifetime. Then, in January, she celebrated her 96th birthday. Mamitu was by her side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We called Catherine mum, because she is like our mother,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p079dvqh&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;she explained to the BBC last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Hamlin died on 18 March at her home in Addis Ababa, the place she made her home. She left behind her son, grandchildren and a dream she wants others to fulfil in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dream is to eradicate obstetric fistula. Forever,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I won’t do this in my lifetime, but you can in yours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on fistula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Occurs as a result of obstructed labour causing a hole in the bladder and/or bowel&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Body Camera Once Again Catches an NYPD Officer Planting Drugs in Someone&amp;#039;s Car</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200318/19164444128/body-camera-once-again-catches-nypd-officer-planting-drugs-someones-car.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200318/19164444128/body-camera-once-again-catches-nypd-officer-planting-drugs-someones-car.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;just-here-to-ruin-lives-and-collect-a-paycheck&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2020/03/18/nypd-misconduct-body-cameras-marijuana/&quot;&gt;If at first you don't get punished, plant, plant again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a police officer in Staten Island was caught by his own body camera in the apparent act of planting marijuana in the car of a group of young men, the video evidence against him was strong enough to prompt prosecutors in the resulting case to throw out the marijuana charge in the middle of a pretrial hearing. A judge cut short his testimony, and prosecutors recommended he get a lawyer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident of unlawfulness by a law enforcement officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/nyregion/body-cameras-police-marijuana-arrest.html&quot;&gt;received national coverage via the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, NYPD officers Kyle Erickson and Elmer Pastran stopped a car for a minor traffic violation, claimed they smelled marijuana, and ensured they smelled marijuana by planting some in the man's car. Officer Erickson turned his camera off during the search, turning it back on in time for him to &quot;discover&quot; some marijuana in the back of the car -- in an area his partner had already declared &quot;cleared.&quot; The man, who was unable to afford bail, spent two weeks in jail until his case was thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Erickson -- whose actions caught on camera were sketchy enough that prosecutors tossed the case -- he went right back to patrolling Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[A]n internal review by the New York Police Department found that no misconduct had occurred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's no deterrence, nothing gets deterred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now a new video — published exclusively by The Intercept — shows the same officer again seemingly planting marijuana during a different traffic stop just a few weeks after the first, raising questions about the credibility of internal review processes and highlighting the lack of transparency in cases of police misconduct. The video, which didn’t emerge for nearly two years, also underscores the limited information available not just to the public but also defendants, and validates criticism by police accountability advocates that body cameras are of no use if the evidence they capture remains inaccessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FChlMRFEZWQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alice Speri points out for The Intercept, body cameras &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191124/18385343449/nypd-finally-releases-body-camera-policy-that-gives-department-plenty-ways-to-withhold-footage.shtml&quot;&gt;are useless&lt;/a&gt; if people -- especially criminal defendants -- can't obtain copies of the evidence being used against them. In this case, the defendant pled guilty to a crime he didn't commit to avoid jail time. He didn't see the video until attorneys with the Legal Aid Society showed it to him. Even worse, the man was only the passenger in the car and was somehow held responsible for drugs planted in a vehicle that didn't belong to him and that he wasn't driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video the NYPD kept hidden from the public shows officers removing Jason Serrano from the car, ignoring his warnings that he had just been stitched up after being stabbed in the stomach. The cops decided Serrano's reluctance was an invitation to throw him on the ground and reopen his wound. Once they were done brutalizing Serrano, they decided this might pose less of a problem for them if they came up with something they could bust him for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Serrano curls up on the sidewalk, bleeding from his wound, and as more officers and bystanders gather on the scene waiting for an ambulance, Pastran searches Serrano’s jacket. “We gotta find something,” Erickson tells him. [...] Erickson again returns to the car and continues to meticulously search it, while Pastran briefs a supervisor who has arrived on the scene. Erickson then appears to place something in the car’s drink holder, before opening the front seat’s console and a small toiletry box. Erickson then says “I smell a little weed” just as he appears to pick up and move the little bud he seemed to have dropped in the drink holder moments earlier. Erickson then searches the back of the car, and when Pastran approaches, the two exchange a charged look as Erickson tells Pastran “I see nothing. … You know what I mean?” He then returns to search the front seat area for a third time, this time dropping a larger bud in the drink holder and saying, “There’s a little bit of weed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the end result of the NYPD's internal investigation deciding two years ago that planting evidence was no big deal. The cop went back out on the street with a partner who enabled evidence-planting. Serrano didn't spend two weeks in jail but he did spend five days handcuffed to a hospital bed. He pled guilty to the resisting arrest charge, even though it was a blatantly bogus arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the unwillingness to discipline officers for more minor things -- like editing body cam footage on the fly -- ensures these officers won't be an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/pdf/policy_pdf/issue_based/20200227_BWCReport.pdf&quot;&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; released last month by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which relies heavily on the footage as it investigates complaints of police misconduct, noted that officers “often failed to properly use their cameras by turning on the BWC late, turning the BWC off early, or not turning the BWC on at all,” the report noted, using an acronym for body-worn cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers don't start their careers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170801/12443937901/body-cam-footage-cop-planting-evidence-leads-to-dozens-dismissed-cases.shtml&quot;&gt;planting evidence&lt;/a&gt; in vehicles to turn routine traffic stops into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140424/07470827017/what-if-you-gave-drug-war-nobody-came-deputies-answer-rhetorical-question-with-planted-evidence.shtml&quot;&gt;drug busts&lt;/a&gt;. They do it because years of experience have shown them cops -- and supervisors -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151001/21103332419/use-of-force-report-finds-nypd-completely-uninterested-policing-itself.shtml&quot;&gt;don't care what they do&lt;/a&gt; as long as it results in arrests. The narrative here confirms it. Cops did a bad thing, got away with it, and went right back to doing the wrong things. The cycle of law enforcement continues with citizens being nothing more than grist for the criminal justice mill.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netflix to cut streaming quality in Europe for 30 days</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Netflix will slightly reduce the video quality on its service in Europe for the next 30 days, to reduce the strain on internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for streaming has increased because large parts of Europe are self-isolating at home due to the coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video-streaming provider said lowering the picture quality would reduce Netflix data consumption by 25%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But movies will still be high-definition or ultra-high definition 4K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change will apply to the UK as well as other European countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Video quality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors influence how much data is used when streaming a movie online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is video resolution, including whether a video is high-definition (HD) or ultra-high definition 4K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is bitrate, which influences how clear and smooth videos look when streamed online. Videos with a higher bitrate tend to look less &quot;blocky&quot; or pixelated, but use more data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of these two, Netflix says it will cut its streaming bitrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who pay for ultra-high definition 4K movies as part of their subscription will still be able to watch 4K films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came after a phone call with European officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;WATCH: How to safely clean your smartphone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, had earlier said people should &quot;switch to standard definition when HD [high-definition] is not necessary&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour of standard definition video uses about 1GB of data, while HD can use up to 3GB an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix also offers ultra-high definition 4K video for some of its programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix's decision to reduce video bitrate by a quarter appears to be a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following the discussions between Commissioner Thierry Breton and [Netflix chief executive] Reed Hastings, and given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus, Netflix has decided to begin reducing bitrates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,&quot; the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Breton praised the  &quot;very prompt action&quot; Netflix took just hours after the phone call, saying it would &quot;preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the Covid-19 crisis&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Internet usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has not yet said whether the bitrate reduction will be applied to other areas such as North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet usage has been heightened in the last few weeks as more people work from home and avoid going out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telecoms giant Vodafone reported a 50% rise in internet use in Europe earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that the platform was seeing &quot;big surges&quot; as users tried to stay connected with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media boss said the company typically saw its largest surge in use on New Year's Eve, but that recent demand had outpaced that. &lt;/p&gt;
