&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re chatting with a customer service agent online, be warned that the person on the other side of your conversation might see what you’re typing in real time. A reader sent us the following transcript from a conversation he had with a mattress company after the agent responded to a message he hadn’t sent yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;584&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;zsm5rs7m8fekhywnzuze&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar recently happened to HmmDaily’s Tom Scocca. He got &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmmdaily.com/2018/11/26/customer-service-chats-are-watching-you-type-before-you-hit-enter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://hmmdaily.com/2018/11/26/customer-service-chats-are-watching-you-type-before-you-hit-enter/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a detailed answer from an agent&lt;/a&gt; one second after he hit send.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling led Scocca to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ladesk.com/features/real-time-typing-view/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.ladesk.com/features/real-time-typing-view/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a live chat service&lt;/a&gt; that offers a feature it calls “real-time typing view” to allow agents to have their “answers prepared before the customer submits his questions.” Another live chat service, which lists McDonalds, Ikea, and Paypal as its customers, calls the same feature “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/how-to-chat-window/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/how-to-chat-window/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;message sneak peek&lt;/a&gt;,” saying it will allow you to “see what the visitor is typing in before they send it over.” Salesforce Live Agent also offers “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/service-cloud/features/live-agent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/service-cloud/features/live-agent/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;sneak peak&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside, you get fast answers. On the downside, your thought process is being unknowingly observed. For the creators, this is technological magic, a deception that will result, they hope, in amazement and satisfaction. But once revealed by an agent who responds too quickly or one who responds before the question is asked, the trick falls apart, and what is left behind feels distinctly creepy, like a rabbit pulled from a hat with a broken neck. “Why give [customers] a fake ‘Send message’ button while secretly transmitting their messages all along?” asks Scocca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular magic trick happens thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/12/17/are-the-websites-youre-using-tracking-what-you-type/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/12/17/are-the-websites-youre-using-tracking-what-you-type/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;JavaScript operating in your browser&lt;/a&gt; and detecting what’s happening on a particular site in real time. It’s also how companies capture information &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/before-you-hit-submit-this-company-has-already-logge-1795906081&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/before-you-hit-submit-this-company-has-already-logge-1795906081', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;you’ve entered into web forms before you’ve hit submit.&lt;/a&gt; Companies could lessen the creepiness by telling people their typing is seen in real time or could eliminate the send button altogether (but that would undoubtedly confuse people, as if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/placebo-buttons-elevators-crosswalks.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/placebo-buttons-elevators-crosswalks.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;the useless buttons in elevators to “close door” or the placebos to push at crosswalks disappeared overnight.&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think unexpected monitoring is limited to your digital interactions, know that you should be paranoid during telephone chats too. As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;New York Times reported over a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, during those calls where you are reassured of “being recorded for quality assurance purposes,” your conversation while on hold is recorded. So even if there is music playing, monitors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/295trs/can_they_hear_me_when_im_on_hold/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/295trs/can_they_hear_me_when_im_on_hold/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;may later&lt;/a&gt; listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;you fight with your spouse, sing a song, or swear about the agent you’re talking to&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/business/your-call-and-rants-on-hold-will-be-monitored.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;2005 NYT article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring is intended to track the performance of call center operators, but the professional snoops are inadvertently monitoring callers, too. Most callers do not realize that they may be taped even while they are on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at these times that monitors hear husbands arguing with their wives, mothers yelling at their children, and dog owners throwing fits at disobedient pets, all when they think no one is listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there is no music playing, the agent may just have &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=611007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=611007', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;you on mute&lt;/a&gt; and be listening to you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So if you don’t want to be monitored or send secret messages to agents, put your phone on mute while on hold and copy/paste messages from another document to your customer service chatbox. And in general, be nice to customer service agents. It’s not their fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Absolutely Right About Racist Algorithms</title>
<link>https://breakermag.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-absolutely-right-about-racist-algorithms/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://breakermag.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-absolutely-right-about-racist-algorithms/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Freshman Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is making headlines on a daily basis, because she’s simultaneously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-media-781571/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hugely popular&lt;/a&gt; among young progressives, and regularly enraging to conservatives and moderates. In just one of several headline moments from the past few days, Ocasio-Cortez appeared on an MLK Day broadcast with author Ta-Nahesi Coates, and declared that facial recognition technologies “always have these racial inequities that get translated, because algorithms are still made by human beings, and those algorithms are still pegged to basic human assumptions. They’re just automated. And automated assumptions—if you don’t fix the bias, then you’re just automating the bias.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments were highlighted on Twitter by Ryan Saavedra, a reporter for the conservative Daily Wire, who commented: “Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claims that algorithms, which are driven by math, are racist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;8.5027027027027&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claims that algorithms, which are driven by math, are racist &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/X2veVvAU1H&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/X2veVvAU1H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1087627739861897216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of Saavedra’s attempted rebuttal (which was followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1087843247840358400&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;classic double-down&lt;/a&gt;) is that mathematics constitutes a kind of objective truth, unswayed by the flawed nature of human judgment. That’s a notion that’s quite widespread in crypto circles, though not usually directly linked to the issue of racism. It’s also total horseshit, and deeply dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with even a tangential familiarity with computer science will recognize that Saavedra’s counterpoint is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of computers in general, and artificial intelligence in particular. Rather than emotionless, all-seeing eyes, machine-learning algorithms are better thought of as blind, deaf, silicon-based infants, being fed information about how humans think until they can crudely imitate those patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the data used to train these systems, and the training practices themselves, can pass on human biases about race. Some varieties of the facial-recognition software Ocasio-Cortez was referring to, for example, have been found by MIT and Microsoft researchers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;misidentify dark-skinned people&lt;/a&gt; at vastly higher rates than light-skinned people. That’s a near-perfect analogue of white people’s tendency to misidentify people of color, leading to higher rates of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/nyregion/the-science-behind-they-all-look-alike-to-me.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;false arrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/7/14834454/exoneration-innocence-prison-racism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;conviction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to describe that as anything other than “a racist algorithm,” but humans are ultimately to blame—apparently the flaw came about because the data sets used to train the software had far more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veridiumid.com/blog/racial-profiling-and-biometrics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;light-skinned males&lt;/a&gt; than members of other groups. Bias can find its way into algorithms in many different ways, though: another great example (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjaminopowers/status/1087876426660044800&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; by our new intern Benjamin Powers), was a recruiting tool built by Amazon that simply reproduced human recruiters’ bias towards male job-seekers, because it was only trained using selections made by humans biased towards male job-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not all about race and gender. Saavedra was quickly confronted with clear examples of how right Ocasio-Cortez was . . . directly from his own Twitter feed. Saavedra had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OsitaNwanevu/status/1087841319219802113&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;repeatedly complained&lt;/a&gt; about supposed bias in social media algorithms, including tweeting that “tech companies tend to be liberal &amp;amp; something is off with their algorithms because they won’t show a lot of content I find by manual search.” There’s not much evidence for this claim of anti-conservative algorithmic bias—content algorithms seem to favor &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/03/11/youtube-extreme-content/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;extremism in general&lt;/a&gt; more than any particular ideology. But Saavedra is clearly happy to echo Ocasio-Cortez’ points about algorithmic bias, when it suits his narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, algorithms aimed at making subtle decisions involving human beings are, mostly, really good at repeating human errors, very fast, many times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters immensely for blockchain entrepreneurs, whose rhetoric often implicitly echoes the idea that math is inherently infallible. That’s perhaps best summed up by the mantra that “code is law” among smart-contracts advocates, a phrase which threatens to conflate the &lt;em&gt;inflexibility&lt;/em&gt; of blockchain transactions with &lt;em&gt;infallibility—&lt;/em&gt;two extremely different things. That blurring might be made easier because crypto is premised on a particular case where code is, in a very limited sense, infallible—cryptography. Cryptography doesn’t involve any real judgment or decision-making, just numerical matching: A hash or a private key are either right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that clarity fails pretty quickly as you move into more complex realms of human life, and crypto and blockchain efforts are aimed at some areas where bias is a clear risk, most obviously finance. Loan and credit decisions have historically been highly subject to human racial and gender bias, and there’s concern that the existing credit-rating system may contain algorithmic elements that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/how-algorithms-can-bring-down-minorities-credit-scores/509333/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;perpetuate racial bias&lt;/a&gt;. If crypto hopes to break down the power imbalances built into the legacy banking system, that seems like a decent place to put some energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that there’s something much deeper to the specifically conservative yearning for a perfect, neutral, algorithmic decision-maker. The nature of that yearning may be best captured in the writing of Eliezer Yudkowski, an AI theorist and philosopher. Yudkowski has for more than a decade pursued the possibility of perfect human reasoning, while also believing that we will inevitably create an all-knowing artificial intelligence that will become a sort of super-rational God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saavedra, with his tweet about how algorithms “driven by math” can’t be racist, was echoing Yudkowski’s unending faith in the perfectibility of reason and reasoning technology. It turns out that the possibility that ethics can be computerized and formalized is pretty appealing to arch-conservatives, and Yudkowski’s thought constitutes a core pillar for the Silicon Valley wing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakermag.com/heres-the-dark-enlightenment-explainer-you-never-wanted/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;neo-reactionaries&lt;/a&gt; who often refer to themselves as “rationalists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yudkowski’s rationalism is also, notoriously, fatally flawed: His system of coldly logical reason was by many accounts completely undone by a logical paradox known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Roko’s Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;. The thought experiment is too complicated to unpack here. But it boils down to the irrefutable conclusion, if one proceeds from Yudkowski’s own premises, that any future super-intelligent AI, even a “friendly” one, would endlessly torture a simulated copy of any human that hadn’t worked to create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a hell of an endpoint for a system of thought aimed at creating a future rationalist utopia. For super-nerd bonus points, it’s also arguably a spin on Godel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;incompleteness theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which proved that no purely rational algorithmic system can completely and consistently model reality, or prove its own rationality. The whole thing is worth reading about in the excellent book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neoreaction-Basilisk-Essays-Around-Alt-Right-ebook/dp/B0782JDGVQ/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Neoreaction A Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; But the takeaway is clear enough: Just because something is expressed in numbers doesn’t make it right, or even rational. And rationality itself might not be quite what it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;What are your kids going to do after school today? More homework? Hopefully not too much of that. What I mean is &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they’ve finished their homework? Do they have time to play? If so, what kind of things will they be doing? Does it really matter? Does this video change your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; height=&quot;381&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XDVDyDJ3s0?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the hit Netflix show, &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;Stranger Things (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/XWxyRG_tckY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/a&gt;, resonated with so many adults for one primary reason: it brought them back to the carefree and wonder-filled days of youth back in the 80’s. I know that is exactly what I liked so much about the show. The story line itself was a bit “meh” in my opinion. But the characters, the bike riding, the exploring through the forests surrounding their town, the Dungeons and Dragons sessions, and the general running around and getting into trouble with friends is what made it such a fun show for me. (Disclaimer: I would definitely recommend watching it using a filtering service like &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;VidAngel (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vidangel.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VidAngel&lt;/a&gt; as the language and some of the content is definitely not family friendly!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not in a position to watch the above video presently, I’ll describe it briefly. An interviewer asks three generations what they did to play when they were growing up. The oldest generation talks about being outside, picking blueberries, growing watermelons, sledding down snow-covered hills, and more. The middle generation related that they did much of the same, including running from door to door, gathering friends and playing street games or night games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shocking part comes when the youngest generation in this video is asked the same questions. The discussion almost completely revolves around electronic devices and video games. One child states, “I’d die without my tablet.” Another child explains that he only feels normal when he’s playing video games. The same boy boasts that he watched 23 episodes of a TV series in less than 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is to Blame for Kids’ Technology Addictions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to shake our heads when watching this video and think to ourselves “Geez! Kids today! What is wrong with them?” I know that is frequently my first reaction. However, I’ve thought about this a lot over the years, and I really do think that it’s quite a bit more complex than just blaming kids for being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Parent’s Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, we’ve heard a lot about “helicopter parents” over the last few years. And even though it’s hard to admit, most of us have allowed ourselves to become overly protective parents to a great extent. Still, there are many factors out there that contribute to this technology crisis that faces this rising generation. But ultimately, we are in control of what our children are exposed to and what activities they engage in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I think back to my childhood (particularly during the summer break), most days my parents had no idea where we were at. I grew up in a small town in northern Arizona that was surrounded by the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the world. There were vast expanses of wilderness directly behind my house. On summer days, my friends and I would get on our dirt bikes and follow miles of game trails all through the forest and up to the base of the volcanic boulder mountain where we would drop our bikes and climb massive rocks and cliffs until sunset. It was glorious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were my parents negligent to allow us such freedom? Personally, I don’t think so, based on the fact that most of my friends had parents with similar parenting styles. Many of these adults had been raised with the same type of autonomy when they were kids. They were just patterning their own parent’s parenting styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give Kids Some Room to Make Mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, if I were to learn that my young kids had left the house in the early morning by themselves to rock climb, explore the forest and encounter heaven-knows-what out in the woods, I’d probably start hyperventilating. I mean, they could get hurt! Some predator could be out in the woods and could haul them away. A wild animal could attack them and drag them off. They could fall down a cliff, never to be seen again. There are so many things that could go wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s my knee-jerk solution as a parent? Sadly, it’s to keep them at home. When they complain that they’re bored? Tell them to read a book or play a board game. When those get old? Turn on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime. And since Netflix has a “kids area” where we can allow them to watch shows more tailored for kids, we feel safe allowing them some freedom to choose what they want to watch. In the meantime, comfortable that our kids are safe at home, we disappear into our home offices and five hours pass before we realize that the kids haven’t moved off of the couch that whole time. Thus, the results of the Nature Valley video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I get it. It’s very tempting to protect our kids from every conceivable risk out there. But everyone, kids included, need some room to make mistakes and occasionally even get hurt. Immersing them in a virtual world where no physical harm can ever occur sounds good at first. But the danger of them becoming so inexperienced and unprepared for the real world may be an even greater danger than we’ve ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technology of Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another huge contributor to this problem of our children becoming chained to electronic devices is the technology itself. There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/the-business-of-addiction-how-the-video-gaming-industry-is-evolving-to-be-like-the-casino-industry-83361&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;mounting evidence (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;mounting evidence&lt;/a&gt; and research that indicates that our kids are in the crosshairs of not-exactly-benign corporations who see them as huge profit centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even in the 80’s we had video games (Atari, Nintendo, Sega, etc.). Those games were fun of course. But they were nothing like the games today which are designed by multi-million dollar companies who hire PhD level psychologists to help create games that are wildly popular and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/memory-medic/201705/video-game-addiction&quot;&gt;addicting&lt;/a&gt;. These games can be so immersive, psychologically stimulating and satisfying, that when compared to real life, it’s no wonder our kids never make it into the outdoors. I’ve been sucked in myself. There was a time when I allowed myself to be sucked into video gaming that led me into 3 a.m. video game session when I knew I had to be to work the next day by 8 a.m. It was crazy that the games were so appealing to me that I was willing to slog through a full day of work on less than 5 hours of sleep. And this was when I was a much younger twenty-something who most likely had developed a much better sense of responsibility and understanding of consequences than the typical teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media and Smart Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just video games that suck youth and adults in. Social media, YouTube, streaming video services like NetFlix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Even cable news and sports networks feed us a constant steady diet of highly entertaining, and yes, addicting content. How many of us have binged watched until the wee hours of the morning a show on NetFlix? I remember the first time I binge-watched a series and how amazed I was at my lack of self-control to just turn the TV off! It was the WB series exploring the early days of Superman “Smallville.” It was a fun, but ultimately worthless entertainment experience. I remember thinking to myself, “I can never get those hours of my life back. Was that really worth it in the end?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to that the fact that children are receiving (at increasingly earlier ages) powerful computers that fit into the palms of their hands that allow 24/7 access to this type of entertainment and social engagement, and you’ve got what we’re seeing today. Something akin to the oft-cited zombie apocalypse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?fit=676%2C380&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-430&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?w=1600&amp;amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?resize=676%2C380&amp;amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i1.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/village-of-the-damned-original.jpg?w=1352&amp;amp;ssl=1 1352w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making it Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes. I think our children are up against a massive hurdle with regard to technology. The entertainment is better and more entertaining. And the availability of it is beyond anything we’ve ever experienced. When I grew up, I watched cartoons on Saturday morning. By 10 a.m., the stations had switched their programming to soap operas (gag!), daytime game shows, or Judge Judy type content. There was nothing to be entertained by in the house anymore. So we went outside whether it was cold or hot! Anything to address the oppressive boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? We had fun most of the time. We got hurt, skinned knees, cuts from climbing trees, and even an occasional fist fight between friends when a pick-up basketball game got a little out of hand. But we learned about human interactions in those experiences too. Overall, we experienced the world as it existed. Not as some programmer out in Silicon Valley designed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, this rising generation is not lost. As parents, we still have a great deal of potential influence over our children. It isn’t easy, but there are still many things we can do to ensure that our kids have good, quality playtime. Playtime grounded in reality – not virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t guessed it yet, the aged 1980’s photo at the top of this page is of my best friend growing up, Jim Dillon, and me probably sometime after Christmas checking out each other’s Christmas presents. He was the one that I had so many of my childhood adventures with. I still sometimes can’t resist the temptation to slap on a photo-ruining cheesy smile. But man, I’m digging those sweatsuits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Actually Improve Playtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;J&lt;strong&gt;ust Unplug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this sounds too simple. But I’m telling you, it works. Yes, there may be anger, tears, begging, and even lots of flailing of limbs. In fact, does this video feel at all familiar to any parents out there? My whole family got a huge kick out of this because we saw so many reflections of ourselves in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; height=&quot;381&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OaDPeZQnUHo?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen it. But come on. As a parent, we know that we have to do hard things. And taking away phones, unplugging video came consoles, setting parental restrictions on streaming devices and smartphones is just part of parenting today. If you’re not doing it, then you are simply conceding your parenting obligations to a stranger who you’ve never met who has no concern for your child beyond what revenue that child can generate for them. Take control and reduce the amount of time your kids are immersed in technology. It’s really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Meaningful Technology Replacements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that you’ve helped your kids unplug, what should they do? Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Karate.jpg?fit=676%2C518&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-431&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Karate.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Karate.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Karate.jpg?resize=768%2C588&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/houseoflawandorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Karate.jpg?resize=676%2C518&amp;amp;ssl=1 676w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get them a bike, skateboard, or roller blades and introduce them to a new skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enroll them (and maybe a friend or two if you can convince them) in a local Girl Scouting or Boy Scouting organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign them up for art classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have them join a community choir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enroll them in youth sports leagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martial Arts (Karate Kid, anyone?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help them start a snow-shoveling business or lawn mowing business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plant a garden or build grow-boxes to teach them the miracle of small-scale real food production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to some like-minded friends and brainstorm some play-dates for your kids at a local park or swimming pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach your kids how to responsibly spend money so they feel empowered to walk down to the corner store with friends and buy a Slurpee when they feel like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a rocket launching set or kites and help them get started in a hobby that they’ve never considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce them to stamp or coin collecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call up some family cousins and schedule some time for them to come over and have a Nerf dart-gun war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach them how to cook or prepare their favorite treat or dessert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s just scratching the surface. Sit down with your spouse or your family and brainstorm for a while. Pick up a calendar, and start penciling some of your ideas into the calendar. That way, the next time your kids say “We’re bored!” you can immediately pick up your list or your calendar and say “Great. I’ve got a plan.” For more ideas, check out an earlier &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;article (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://houseoflawandorder.com/making-the-most-of-your-family-time-prioritize-experiences/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about how our family does this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be resistance, I can assure you. But I can also assure you that your kids will look back on their childhoods with much more fondness than if you just leave them to their electronics. Spend time together. Spend time away from home. Get them out of the house and let them explore the real world. Your kids will have plenty of time in their adult lives to be lost in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Alarming Decline of Quality, Youth Playtime - House of Law and Order</og:title>
<og:description>Our youth are growing up in a virtual world. What can be done to re-introduce them to the real world? Unplug and calendar up some real activity.</og:description>

<title>Oracle allegedly underpaid $400M in wages to underrepresented employees</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/oracle-discrimination-400-million/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/oracle-discrimination-400-million/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;oracle&quot;&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; has allegedly withheld $400 million in wages from racially underrepresented workers (black, Latinx and Asian) as well as women, &lt;a href=&quot;http://src.bna.com/EXa&quot;&gt;the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs said in a filing today&lt;/a&gt;. The OFCCP is the office within the DOL that enforces equal pay and ensures government contractors comply with anti-discrimination regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OFCCP’s second amended complaint today, the office alleges Oracle “impermissibly denies equal employment opportunity to non-Asian applicants for employment, strongly preferring a workforce that it can later underpay. Once employed, women, Blacks and Asians are systematically underpaid relative to their peers,” the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, Oracle’s underpayment of certain employees is driven by the company’s reliance on prior salary information and funneling non-white, non-male employees into lower-paid roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department argues that Oracle’s “stark patterns of discrimination” started back in 2013 and continues into the present day. More specifically, the OFCCP alleges Oracle discriminated against black, Asian and female employees. This has all ultimately resulted in the collective loss of more than $400 million for this group of employees, the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office also alleges Oracle discriminates against those who have visas, often putting them in low-level jobs. The vast majority of hires from Oracle’s college recruiting program, the suit alleges, were international students with student visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These students required work authorization to remain in the United States after graduation,” the suit alleges. “In other words, Oracle overwhelmingly hires workers dependent upon Oracle for sponsorship to remain in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFCCP filed the suit against Oracle last January, following the Labor Department’s 2014 audit of the company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/29/former-oracle-employees-sue-company-for-alleged-pay-discrimination/&quot;&gt;That suit was followed by an employee-led class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; last September alleging Oracle pays women less than men in similar jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle is subject to auditing as a result of its contracts with the federal government. Given Oracle’s agreement to provide equal employment opportunity, the OFCCP is asking the Court to require Oracle to pay those affected and correct its “discriminatory compensation and hiring practices.” The office is also demanding that Oracle lose its $100 million worth of annual contracts with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, which declined to comment for this story, is not the only company the OFCCP has gone after. A couple of years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/the-u-s-department-of-labor-is-suing-google-for-compensation-data/&quot;&gt;the office went after Google&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to obtain compensation data, followed by a claim that Google has systemic gender-based pay inequities. That same year, the office &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/26/u-s-department-of-labor-sues-palantir-for-racial-discrimination/&quot;&gt;sued Palantir for racial discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Palantir, several months later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/palantir-settles-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-with-the-department-of-labor/&quot;&gt;settled with the DOL&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to pay $1.7 million in back wages and other types of monetary relief to those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Jan 23. 2019: &lt;/strong&gt;Oracle has since decided to comment. See story below.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Last January the Dell XPS 13 developer edition (9370) made its debut.  Today we’re excited to announce that one year later its successor, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop?appliedRefinements=302&quot;&gt;XPS 13 developer edition (9380)&lt;/a&gt;, is now available in the US, Canada and Europe.  (Note: both the 9370 and 9380 will coexist for a period of time.)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bartongeorge.io/2019/01/23/the-new-dell-xps-13-developer-edition-now-available-in-the-us-europe-and-canada/will-9380-18-04-cropped/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-10140&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;10140&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://bartongeorge.io/2019/01/23/the-new-dell-xps-13-developer-edition-now-available-in-the-us-europe-and-canada/will-9380-18-04-cropped/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;525,309&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;will 9380 + 18.04 cropped&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=450&amp;amp;h=265&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-10140&quot; src=&quot;https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=450&amp;amp;h=265&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; srcset=&quot;https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=450&amp;amp;h=265 450w, https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=88 150w, https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=177 300w, https://barton808.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/will-9380-18.04-cropped.png 525w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Sputnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9380 represents the eighth generation of Dell’s Ubuntu-based XPS 13 developer edition series.  The first generation of the developer edition &lt;a href=&quot;https://bartongeorge.io/2012/11/29/sputnik-has-landed-introducing-the-dell-xps-13-laptop-developer-edition/&quot;&gt;debuted&lt;/a&gt; over six years ago and it, along with the Ubuntu-based Precision mobile workstations that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bartongeorge.io/2015/01/27/welcome-the-dell-precision-m3800-mobile-workstation-developer-edition/&quot;&gt;launched in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, make up &lt;a href=&quot;https://bartongeorge.io/2017/11/29/project-sputnik-turns-five/&quot;&gt;Project Sputnik&lt;/a&gt;.  In case you’re not familiar with it, Project Sputnik is Dell’s skunkworks initiative driven by input from the developer community (see the timeline at the end of the post for the complete XPS 13 developer edition progression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop?appliedRefinements=302&quot;&gt;Dell XPS 13 developer edition (9380)&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are many great features and specs that characterize the latest developer edition (see below), the one that will likely bring the most joy is the new placement of the webcam.  In the 9370 the camera is located directly below the screen.  In the new 9380 the camera has been moved to the top, providing a much more flattering view of the user while still maintaining the system’s sleek, compact design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that but the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation developer edition supports Suspend-to-idle natively which allows the system to resume much more quickly from sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 9380 Specifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation i3, i5 and i7 processors (Intel Whiskey Lake U, 15W, non-vPro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 LTS preloaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;InfinityEdge display with top camera placement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FHD and UHD resolution support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 16GB of LPDDR3 memory at 2133MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x NVMe slot for 2230-128GB / 2280 up to 2TB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbolt 3 (x2) with USB3.1 Gen2 + type-C x1 with USB3.1 Gen2 speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Thunderbolt runtime power management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Killer&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 1435 802.11ac [2×2] + Bluetooth 4.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and Canada &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US and Canada there are four base configs that can be configured in a multitude of ways, yielding 22 configurations.  These base configs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|8GB|256GB|FHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|8GB|256GB|UHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|16GB|512GB|UHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|16GB|256GB|UHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: unlike Europe, in the United States and Canada the developer edition can only be purchased in the “For Work” section.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating the US and Canada to the punch, on January 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; the first configurations of the new XPS 13 developer edition became available in Europe.  At the end of last week two more joined to complete the lineup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|16GB|512GB|UHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|16GB|1TB|UHD T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|8GB|256GB|FHD NT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i7 QC|16GB|512GB|FHD NT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above configurations are available in both the “For Home” and “For Work” sections on Dell.com and are available online in the following countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Austria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belgium (Dutch and French)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switzerland (German and French)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denmark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United Kingdom &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;- The developer editions will be added to shortly to the 9380 product page.  Until then, the systems can be purchased via chat on the product page or by calling the number that pops up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to announce the next generation of the XPS 13 developer edition is a great way to begin the year.  Watch this space to see what is next on the agenda for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Our Software Dependency Problem</title>
<link>https://research.swtch.com/deps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://research.swtch.com/deps</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, discussion of software reuse was far more common than actual software reuse. Today, the situation is reversed: developers reuse software written by others every day, in the form of software dependencies, and the situation goes mostly unexamined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own background includes a decade of working with Google’s internal source code system, which treats software dependencies as a first-class concept,&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body1&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and also developing support for dependencies in the Go programming language.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body2&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software dependencies carry with them serious risks that are too often overlooked. The shift to easy, fine-grained software reuse has happened so quickly that we do not yet understand the best practices for choosing and using dependencies effectively, or even for deciding when they are appropriate and when not. My purpose in writing this article is to raise awareness of the risks and encourage more investigation of solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s software development world, a &lt;em&gt;dependency&lt;/em&gt; is additional code that you want to call from your program. Adding a dependency avoids repeating work already done: designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining a specific unit of code. In this article we’ll call that unit of code a &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt;; some systems use terms like library or module instead of package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking on externally-written dependencies is an old practice: most programmers have at one point in their careers had to go through the steps of manually downloading and installing a required library, like C’s PCRE or zlib, or C++’s Boost or Qt, or Java’s JodaTime or JUnit. These packages contain high-quality, debugged code that required significant expertise to develop. For a program that needs the functionality provided by one of these packages, the tedious work of manually downloading, installing, and updating the package is easier than the work of redeveloping that functionality from scratch. But the high fixed costs of reuse mean that manually-reused packages tend to be big: a tiny package would be easier to reimplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;dependency manager&lt;/em&gt; (sometimes called a package manager) automates the downloading and installation of dependency packages. As dependency managers make individual packages easier to download and install, the lower fixed costs make smaller packages economical to publish and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Node.js dependency manager NPM provides access to over 750,000 packages. One of them, &lt;code&gt;escape-string-regexp&lt;/code&gt;, provides a single function that escapes regular expression operators in its input. The entire implementation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var matchOperatorsRe = /[|\\{}()[\]^$+*?.]/g;

module.exports = function (str) {
        if (typeof str !== 'string') {
                throw new TypeError('Expected a string');
        }
        return str.replace(matchOperatorsRe, '\\$&amp;amp;');
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before dependency managers, publishing an eight-line code library would have been unthinkable: too much overhead for too little benefit. But NPM has driven the overhead approximately to zero, with the result that nearly-trivial functionality can be packaged and reused. In late January 2019, the &lt;code&gt;escape-string-regexp&lt;/code&gt; package is explicitly depended upon by almost a thousand other NPM packages, not to mention all the packages developers write for their own use and don’t share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency managers now exist for essentially every programming language. Maven Central (Java), Nuget (.NET), Packagist (PHP), PyPI (Python), and RubyGems (Ruby) each host over 100,000 packages. The arrival of this kind of fine-grained, widespread software reuse is one of the most consequential shifts in software development over the past two decades. And if we’re not more careful, it will lead to serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A package, for this discussion, is code you download from the internet. Adding a package as a dependency outsources the work of developing that code—designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining—to someone else on the internet, someone you often don’t know. By using that code, you are exposing your own program to all the failures and flaws in the dependency. Your program’s execution now literally &lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on code downloaded from this stranger on the internet. Presented this way, it sounds incredibly unsafe. Why would anyone do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this because it’s easy, because it seems to work, because everyone else is doing it too, and, most importantly, because it seems like a natural continuation of age-old established practice. But there are important differences we’re ignoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, most developers already trusted others to write software they depended on, such as operating systems and compilers. That software was bought from known sources, often with some kind of support agreement. There was still a potential for bugs or outright mischief,&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body3&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but at least we knew who we were dealing with and usually had commercial or legal recourses available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of open-source software, distributed at no cost over the internet, has displaced many of those earlier software purchases. When reuse was difficult, there were fewer projects publishing reusable code packages. Even though their licenses typically disclaimed, among other things, any “implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,” the projects built up well-known reputations that often factored heavily into people’s decisions about which to use. The commercial and legal support for trusting our software sources was replaced by reputational support. Many common early packages still enjoy good reputations: consider BLAS (published 1979), Netlib (1987), libjpeg (1991), LAPACK (1992), HP STL (1994), and zlib (1995).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency managers have scaled this open-source code reuse model down: now, developers can share code at the granularity of individual functions of tens of lines. This is a major technical accomplishment. There are myriad available packages, and writing code can involve such a large number of them, but the commercial, legal, and reputational support mechanisms for trusting the code have not carried over. We are trusting more code with less justification for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of adopting a bad dependency can be viewed as the sum, over all possible bad outcomes, of the cost of each bad outcome multiplied by its probability of happening (risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img name=&quot;deps-cost&quot; class=&quot;center pad&quot; width=&quot;383&quot; height=&quot;95&quot; src=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps-cost.png&quot; srcset=&quot;deps-cost.png 1x, deps-cost@1.5x.png 1.5x, deps-cost@2x.png 2x, deps-cost@3x.png 3x, deps-cost@4x.png 4x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context where a dependency will be used determines the cost of a bad outcome. At one end of the spectrum is a personal hobby project, where the cost of most bad outcomes is near zero: you’re just having fun, bugs have no real impact other than wasting some time, and even debugging them can be fun. So the risk probability almost doesn’t matter: it’s being multiplied by zero. At the other end of the spectrum is production software that must be maintained for years. Here, the cost of a bug in a dependency can be very high: servers may go down, sensitive data may be divulged, customers may be harmed, companies may fail. High failure costs make it much more important to estimate and then reduce any risk of a serious failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what the expected cost, experiences with larger dependencies suggest some approaches for estimating and reducing the risks of adding a software dependency. It is likely that better tooling is needed to help reduce the costs of these approaches, much as dependency managers have focused to date on reducing the costs of download and installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would not hire a software developer you’ve never heard of and know nothing about. You would learn more about them first: check references, conduct a job interview, run background checks, and so on. Before you depend on a package you found on the internet, it is similarly prudent to learn a bit about it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic inspection can give you a sense of how likely you are to run into problems trying to use this code. If the inspection reveals likely minor problems, you can take steps to prepare for or maybe avoid them. If the inspection reveals major problems, it may be best not to use the package: maybe you’ll find a more suitable one, or maybe you need to develop one yourself. Remember that open-source packages are published by their authors in the hope that they will be useful but with no guarantee of usability or support. In the middle of a production outage, you’ll be the one debugging it. As the original GNU General Public License warned, “The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.”&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body4&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this section outlines some considerations when inspecting a package and deciding whether to depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is package’s documentation clear? Does the API have a clear design? If the authors can explain the package’s API and its design well to you, the user, in the documentation, that increases the likelihood they have explained the implementation well to the computer, in the source code. Writing code for a clear, well-designed API is also easier, faster, and hopefully less error-prone. Have the authors documented what they expect from client code in order to make future upgrades compatible? (Examples include the C++&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body5&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Go&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body6&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compatibility documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;code_quality&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#code_quality&quot;&gt;Code Quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the code well-written? Read some of it. Does it look like the authors have been careful, conscientious, and consistent? Does it look like code you’d want to debug? You may need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop your own systematic ways to check code quality. For example, something as simple as compiling a C or C++ program with important compiler warnings enabled (for example, &lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt;) can give you a sense of how seriously the developers work to avoid various undefined behaviors. Recent languages like Go, Rust, and Swift use an &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; keyword to mark code that violates the type system; look to see how much unsafe code there is. More advanced semantic tools like Infer&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body7&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or SpotBugs&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body8&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are helpful too. Linters are less helpful: you should ignore rote suggestions about topics like brace style and focus instead on semantic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an open mind to development practices you may not be familiar with. For example, the SQLite library ships as a single 200,000-line C source file and a single 11,000-line header, the “amalgamation.” The sheer size of these files should raise an initial red flag, but closer investigation would turn up the actual development source code, a traditional file tree with over a hundred C source files, tests, and support scripts. It turns out that the single-file distribution is built automatically from the original sources and is easier for end users, especially those without dependency managers. (The compiled code also runs faster, because the compiler can see more optimization opportunities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the code have tests? Can you run them? Do they pass? Tests establish that the code’s basic functionality is correct, and they signal that the developer is serious about keeping it correct. For example, the SQLite development tree has an incredibly thorough test suite with over 30,000 individual test cases as well as developer documentation explaining the testing strategy.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body9&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note9&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, if there are few tests or no tests, or if the tests fail, that’s a serious red flag: future changes to the package are likely to introduce regressions that could easily have been caught. If you insist on tests in code you write yourself (you do, right?), you should insist on tests in code you outsource to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the tests exist, run, and pass, you can gather more information by running them with run-time instrumentation like code coverage analysis, race detection,&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body10&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note10&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; memory allocation checking, and memory leak detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;debugging&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#debugging&quot;&gt;Debugging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the package’s issue tracker. Are there many open bug reports? How long have they been open? Are there many fixed bugs? Have any bugs been fixed recently? If you see lots of open issues about what look like real bugs, especially if they have been open for a long time, that’s not a good sign. On the other hand, if the closed issues show that bugs are rarely found and promptly fixed, that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintenance&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#maintenance&quot;&gt;Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the package’s commit history. How long has the code been actively maintained? Is it actively maintained now? Packages that have been actively maintained for an extended amount of time are more likely to continue to be maintained. How many people work on the package? Many packages are personal projects that developers create and share for fun in their spare time. Others are the result of thousands of hours of work by a group of paid developers. In general, the latter kind of package is more likely to have prompt bug fixes, steady improvements, and general upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some code really is “done.” For example, NPM’s &lt;code&gt;escape-string-regexp&lt;/code&gt;, shown earlier, may never need to be modified again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do many other packages depend on this code? Dependency managers can often provide statistics about usage, or you can use a web search to estimate how often others write about using the package. More users should at least mean more people for whom the code works well enough, along with faster detection of new bugs. Widespread usage is also a hedge against the question of continued maintenance: if a widely-used package loses its maintainer, an interested user is likely to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, libraries like PCRE or Boost or JUnit are incredibly widely used. That makes it more likely—although certainly not guaranteed—that bugs you might otherwise run into have already been fixed, because others ran into them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you be processing untrusted inputs with the package? If so, does it seem to be robust against malicious inputs? Does it have a history of security problems listed in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)?&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body11&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note11&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when Jeff Dean and I started work on Google Code Search&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body12&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note12&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; over public source code—in 2006, the popular PCRE regular expression library seemed like an obvious choice. In an early discussion with Google’s security team, however, we learned that PCRE had a history of problems like buffer overflows, especially in its parser. We could have learned the same by searching for PCRE in the NVD. That discovery didn’t immediately cause us to abandon PCRE, but it did make us think more carefully about testing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;licensing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#licensing&quot;&gt;Licensing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the code properly licensed? Does it have a license at all? Is the license acceptable for your project or company? A surprising fraction of projects on GitHub have no clear license. Your project or company may impose further restrictions on the allowed licenses of dependencies. For example, Google disallows the use of code licensed under AGPL-like licenses (too onerous) as well as WTFPL-like licenses (too vague).&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body13&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note13&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dependencies&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#dependencies&quot;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the code have dependencies of its own? Flaws in indirect dependencies are just as bad for your program as flaws in direct dependencies. Dependency managers can list all the transitive dependencies of a given package, and each of them should ideally be inspected as described in this section. A package with many dependencies incurs additional inspection work, because those same dependencies incur additional risk that needs to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers have never looked at the full list of transitive dependencies of their code and don’t know what they depend on. For example, in March 2016 the NPM user community discovered that many popular projects—including Babel, Ember, and React—all depended indirectly on a tiny package called &lt;code&gt;left-pad&lt;/code&gt;, consisting of a single 8-line function body. They discovered this when the author of &lt;code&gt;left-pad&lt;/code&gt; deleted that package from NPM, inadvertently breaking most Node.js users’ builds.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body14&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note14&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;code&gt;left-pad&lt;/code&gt; is hardly exceptional in this regard. For example, 30% of the 750,000 packages published on NPM depend—at least indirectly—on &lt;code&gt;escape-string-regexp&lt;/code&gt;. Adapting Leslie Lamport’s observation about distributed systems, a dependency manager can easily create a situation in which the failure of a package you didn’t even know existed can render your own code unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspection process should include running a package’s own tests. If the package passes the inspection and you decide to make your project depend on it, the next step should be to write new tests focused on the functionality needed by your application. These tests often start out as short standalone programs written to make sure you can understand the package’s API and that it does what you think it does. (If you can’t or it doesn’t, turn back now!) It is worth then taking the extra effort to turn those programs into automated tests that can be run against newer versions of the package. If you find a bug and have a potential fix, you’ll want to be able to rerun these project-specific tests easily, to make sure that the fix did not break anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is especially worth exercising the likely problem areas identified by the basic inspection. For Code Search, we knew from past experience that PCRE sometimes took a long time to execute certain regular expression searches. Our initial plan was to have separate thread pools for “simple” and “complicated” regular expression searches. One of the first tests we ran was a benchmark, comparing &lt;code&gt;pcregrep&lt;/code&gt; with a few other &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; implementations. When we found that, for one basic test case, &lt;code&gt;pcregrep&lt;/code&gt; was 70X slower than the fastest &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; available, we started to rethink our plan to use PCRE. Even though we eventually dropped PCRE entirely, that benchmark remains in our code base today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on a package is a decision that you are likely to revisit later. Perhaps updates will take the package in a new direction. Perhaps serious security problems will be found. Perhaps a better option will come along. For all these reasons, it is worth the effort to make it easy to migrate your project to a new dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the package will be used from many places in your project’s source code, migrating to a new dependency would require making changes to all those different source locations. Worse, if the package will be exposed in your own project’s API, migrating to a new dependency would require making changes in all the code calling your API, which you might not control. To avoid these costs, it makes sense to define an interface of your own, along with a thin wrapper implementing that interface using the dependency. Note that the wrapper should include only what your project needs from the dependency, not everything the dependency offers. Ideally, that allows you to substitute a different, equally appropriate dependency later, by changing only the wrapper. Migrating your per-project tests to use the new interface tests the interface and wrapper implementation and also makes it easy to test any potential replacements for the dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Code Search, we developed an abstract &lt;code&gt;Regexp&lt;/code&gt; class that defined the interface Code Search needed from any regular expression engine. Then we wrote a thin wrapper around PCRE implementing that interface. The indirection made it easy to test alternate libraries, and it kept us from accidentally introducing knowledge of PCRE internals into the rest of the source tree. That in turn ensured that it would be easy to switch to a different dependency if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may also be appropriate to isolate a dependency at run-time, to limit the possible damage caused by bugs in it. For example, Google Chrome allows users to add dependencies—extension code—to the browser. When Chrome launched in 2008, it introduced the critical feature (now standard in all browsers) of isolating each extension in a sandbox running in a separate operating-system process.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body15&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note15&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An exploitable bug in an badly-written extension therefore did not automatically have access to the entire memory of the browser itself and could be stopped from making inappropriate system calls.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body16&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note16&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For Code Search, until we dropped PCRE entirely, our plan was to isolate at least the PCRE parser in a similar sandbox. Today, another option would be a lightweight hypervisor-based sandbox like gVisor.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body17&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note17&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Isolating dependencies reduces the associated risks of running that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these examples and other off-the-shelf options, run-time isolation of suspect code is still too difficult and rarely done. True isolation would require a completely memory-safe language, with no escape hatch into untyped code. That’s challenging not just in entirely unsafe languages like C and C++ but also in languages that provide restricted unsafe operations, like Java when including JNI, or like Go, Rust, and Swift when including their “unsafe” features. Even in a memory-safe language like JavaScript, code often has access to far more than it needs. In November 2018, the latest version of the NPM package &lt;code&gt;event-stream&lt;/code&gt;, which provided a functional streaming API for JavaScript events, was discovered to contain obfuscated malicious code that had been added two and a half months earlier. The code, which harvested large Bitcoin wallets from users of the Copay mobile app, was accessing system resources entirely unrelated to processing event streams.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body18&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note18&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of many possible defenses to this kind of problem would be to better restrict what dependencies can access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a dependency seems too risky and you can’t find a way to isolate it, the best answer may be to avoid it entirely, or at least to avoid the parts you’ve identified as most problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as we better understood the risks and costs associated with PCRE, our plan for Google Code Search evolved from “use PCRE directly,” to “use PCRE but sandbox the parser,” to “write a new regular expression parser but keep the PCRE execution engine,” to “write a new parser and connect it to a different, more efficient open-source execution engine.” Later we rewrote the execution engine as well, so that no dependencies were left, and we open-sourced the result: RE2.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body19&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note19&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only need a tiny fraction of a dependency, it may be simplest to make a copy of what you need (preserving appropriate copyright and other legal notices, of course). You are taking on responsibility for fixing bugs, maintenance, and so on, but you’re also completely isolated from the larger risks. The Go developer community has a proverb about this: “A little copying is better than a little dependency.”&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body20&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note20&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the conventional wisdom about software was “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Upgrading carries a chance of introducing new bugs; without a corresponding reward—like a new feature you need—why take the risk? This analysis ignores two costs. The first is the cost of the eventual upgrade. In software, the difficulty of making code changes does not scale linearly: making ten small changes is less work and easier to get right than making one equivalent large change. The second is the cost of discovering already-fixed bugs the hard way. Especially in a security context, where known bugs are actively exploited, every day you wait is another day that attackers can break in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the year 2017 at Equifax, as recounted by executives in detailed congressional testimony.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body21&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note21&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On March 7, a new vulnerability in Apache Struts was disclosed, and a patched version was released. On March 8, Equifax received a notice from US-CERT about the need to update any uses of Apache Struts. Equifax ran source code and network scans on March 9 and March 15, respectively; neither scan turned up a particular group of public-facing web servers. On May 13, attackers found the servers that Equifax’s security teams could not. They used the Apache Struts vulnerability to breach Equifax’s network and then steal detailed personal and financial information about 148 million people over the next two months. Equifax finally noticed the breach on July 29 and publicly disclosed it on September 4. By the end of September, Equifax’s CEO, CIO, and CSO had all resigned, and a congressional investigation was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax’s experience drives home the point that although dependency managers know the versions they are using at build time, you need other arrangements to track that information through your production deployment process. For the Go language, we are experimenting with automatically including a version manifest in every binary, so that deployment processes can scan binaries for dependencies that need upgrading. Go also makes that information available at run-time, so that servers can consult databases of known bugs and self-report to monitoring software when they are in need of upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading promptly is important, but upgrading means adding new code to your project, which should mean updating your evaluation of the risks of using the dependency based on the new version. As minimum, you’d want to skim the diffs showing the changes being made from the current version to the upgraded versions, or at least read the release notes, to identify the most likely areas of concern in the upgraded code. If a lot of code is changing, so that the diffs are difficult to digest, that is also information you can incorporate into your risk assessment update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also want to re-run the tests you’ve written that are specific to your project, to make sure the upgraded package is at least as suitable for the project as the earlier version. It also makes sense to re-run the package’s own tests. If the package has its own dependencies, it is entirely possible that your project’s configuration uses different versions of those dependencies (either older or newer ones) than the package’s authors use. Running the package’s own tests can quickly identify problems specific to your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, upgrades should not be completely automatic. You need to verify that the upgraded versions are appropriate for your environment before deploying them.&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body22&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note22&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your upgrade process includes re-running the integration and qualification tests you’ve already written for the dependency, so that you are likely to identify new problems before they reach production, then, in most cases, delaying an upgrade is riskier than upgrading quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The window for security-critical upgrades is especially short. In the aftermath of the Equifax breach, forensic security teams found evidence that attackers (perhaps different ones) had successfully exploited the Apache Struts vulnerability on the affected servers on March 10, only three days after it was publicly disclosed, but they’d only run a single &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after all that work, you’re not done tending your dependencies. It’s important to continue to monitor them and perhaps even re-evaluate your decision to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure that you keep using the specific package versions you think you are. Most dependency managers now make it easy or even automatic to record the cryptographic hash of the expected source code for a given package version and then to check that hash when re-downloading the package on another computer or in a test environment. This ensures that your build use the same dependency source code you inspected and tested. These kinds of checks prevented the &lt;code&gt;event-stream&lt;/code&gt; attacker, described earlier, from silently inserting malicious code in the already-released version 3.3.5. Instead, the attacker had to create a new version, 3.3.6, and wait for people to upgrade (without looking closely at the changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to watch for new indirect dependencies creeping in: upgrades can easily introduce new packages upon which the success of your project now depends. They deserve your attention as well. In the case of &lt;code&gt;event-stream&lt;/code&gt;, the malicious code was hidden in a different package, &lt;code&gt;flatmap-stream&lt;/code&gt;, which the new &lt;code&gt;event-stream&lt;/code&gt; release added as a new dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creeping dependencies can also affect the size of your project. During the development of Google’s Sawzall&lt;a class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;body23&quot; href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/deps#note23&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a JIT’ed logs processing language—the authors discovered at various times that the main interpreter binary contained not just Sawzall’s JIT but also (unused) PostScript, Python, and JavaScript interpreters. Each time, the culprit turned out to be unused dependencies declared by some library Sawzall did depend on, combined with the fact that Google’s build system eliminated any manual effort needed to start using a new dependency.. This kind of error is the reason that the Go language makes importing an unused package a compile-time error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading is a natural time to revisit the decision to use a dependency that’s changing. It’s also important to periodically revisit any dependency that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; changing. Does it seem plausible that there are no security problems or other bugs to fix? Has the project been abandoned? Maybe it’s time to start planning to replace that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to recheck the security history of each dependency. For example, Apache Struts disclosed different major remote code execution vulnerabilities in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Even if you have a list of all the servers that run it and update them promptly, that track record might make you rethink using it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software reuse is finally here, and I don’t mean to understate its benefits: it has brought an enormously positive transformation for software developers. Even so, we’ve accepted this transformation without completely thinking through the potential consequences. The old reasons for trusting dependencies are becoming less valid at exactly the same time we have more dependencies than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of critical examination of specific dependencies that I outlined in this article is a significant amount of work and remains the exception rather than the rule. But I doubt there are any developers who actually make the effort to do this for every possible new dependency. I have only done a subset of them for a subset of my own dependencies. Most of the time the entirety of the decision is “let’s see what happens.” Too often, anything more than that seems like too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Copay and Equifax attacks are clear warnings of real problems in the way we consume software dependencies today. We should not ignore the warnings. I offer three broad recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recognize the problem.&lt;/em&gt; If nothing else, I hope this article has convinced you that there is a problem here worth addressing. We need many people to focus significant effort on solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish best practices for today.&lt;/em&gt; We need to establish best practices for managing dependencies using what’s available today. This means working out processes that evaluate, reduce, and track risk, from the original adoption decision through to production use. In fact, just as some engineers specialize in testing, it may be that we need engineers who specialize in managing dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop better dependency technology for tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; Dependency managers have essentially eliminated the cost of downloading and installing a dependency. Future development effort should focus on reducing the cost of the kind of evaluation and maintenance necessary to use a dependency. For example, package discovery sites might work to find more ways to allow developers to share their findings. Build tools should, at the least, make it easy to run a package’s own tests. More aggressively, build tools and package management systems could also work together to allow package authors to test new changes against all public clients of their APIs. Languages should also provide easy ways to isolate a suspect package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of good software out there. Let’s work together to find out how to reuse it safely.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I use old hardware</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2019/01/23/Why-I-use-old-hardware.html?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2019/01/23/Why-I-use-old-hardware.html?</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was making sure my main laptop is ready for travel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, which mostly just entails syncing up the latest version of my music collection. This laptop is a Thinkpad X200, which turns 11 years old in July and is my main workstation away from home (though I bring a second monitor and an external keyboard for long trips). This laptop is a great piece of hardware. 100% of the hardware is supported by the upstream Linux kernel, including the usual offenders like WiFi and Bluetooth. Niche operating systems like 9front and Minix work great, too. Even coreboot works! It’s durable, user-serviceable, light, and still looks brand new after all of these years. I love all of these things, but there’s no denying that it’s 11 years behind on performance innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; generously &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/2018/04/28/KDE-Sprint-retrospective.html&quot;&gt;invited me&lt;/a&gt; to and sponsored my travel to their development sprint in Berlin. One of my friends there teased me - in a friendly way - about my laptop, asking why I used such an old system. There was a pensive moment when I answered: “it forces me to empathise with users who can’t use high-end hardware”. I showed him how it could cold boot to a productive &lt;a href=&quot;https://swaywm.org&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt; desktop in &amp;lt;30 seconds, then I installed KDE to compare. It doubled the amount of disk space in use, took almost 10x as long to reach a usable desktop, and had severe rendering issues with my old Intel GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, KDE is a wonderful piece of software and my first recommendation to most non-technical computer users who ask me for advice on using Linux. But software often grows to use the hardware you give it. Software developers tend to be computer enthusiasts, and use enthusiast-grade hardware. In reality, this high-end hardware isn’t really &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for most applications outside of video encoding, machine learning, and a few other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a more powerful workstation at home, but it’s not really anything special. I upgrade it very infrequently. I bought a new mid-range GPU which is able to drive my four displays&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt; last year, I’ve added the occasional hard drive as it gets full, and I replaced the case with something lighter weight 3 years ago. Outside of those minor upgrades, I’ve been using the same desktop workstation for 7 years, and intend to use it for much longer. My servers are similarly running on older hardware which is spec’d to their needs (actually, I left a lot of room to grow and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; was able to buy old hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 11-year-old laptop can compile the Linux kernel from scratch in 20 minutes, and it can play 1080p video in real-time. That’s all I need! Many users cannot afford high-end computer hardware, and most have better things to spend their money on. And you know, I work hard for my money, too - if I can get a computer which can do nearly 5 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; operations per second for $60, that should be sufficient to solve nearly any problem. No doubt, there are faster laptops out there, many of them with similarly impressive levels of compatibility with my ideals. But why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Travis CI acquired by Idera</title>
<link>https://blog.travis-ci.com/2019-01-23-travis-ci-joins-idera-inc</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.travis-ci.com/2019-01-23-travis-ci-joins-idera-inc</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When we started working on a Continuous Integration solution back in 2011, it was hard to imagine what Travis CI would become. Years later, we’re still continuously working to make our community and the tech industry better and stronger. Today we are excited to announce that Travis CI has been acquired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ideracorp.com/&quot;&gt;Idera, Inc&lt;/a&gt;. Idera is the parent company of many software productivity tools and will support us in delivering quality software to all of you, our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grown out of the open source community, Travis CI became the leading CI solution and we now provide enhanced features, performance, and support to projects and teams of all sizes. We are proud to serve more than 700,000 people worldwide to build and test software applications. Our customers include IBM, Schibsted, and Zendesk, amongst many others. Together with Idera, we want to expand on this success and help many more people build better software faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-anything-change-for-me&quot;&gt;Will anything change for me?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Travis CI, we are committed to remaining the solid stand-alone solution you have come to rely on. We will continue to offer the same services to our hosted and on-premises users. With the support from our new partners, we will be able to invest in expanding and improving our core product, to have Travis CI be the best Continuous Integration and Development solution for software projects out there. We will join Idera’s Testing Tools division, which also includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gurock.com/testrail&quot;&gt;TestRail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ranorex.com/&quot;&gt;Ranorex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kiuwan.com/&quot;&gt;Kiuwan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-impact-will-this-have-on-open-source&quot;&gt;What impact will this have on open source?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is at the heart of Travis CI. We will continue to maintain a free, hosted service for open source projects, and will keep building features for the open source community. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/travis-ci&quot;&gt;our code&lt;/a&gt; will stay open source and under an MIT license. This is who we are, this is what made us successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-the-travis-foundation&quot;&gt;What about the Travis Foundation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.travis-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Travis Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has done phenomenal work running projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/&quot;&gt;Rails Girls Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversitytickets.org/&quot;&gt;Diversity Tickets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerinnen.org/&quot;&gt;Speakerinnen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhprompt.org/&quot;&gt;Prompt&lt;/a&gt;. While this is new territory for Idera, they are impressed with what we have built, and fully committed to not just to keep it running, but also see how we can increase our efforts in making the tech industry a better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re very excited to start off 2019 with the support of Idera and have a better platform to continue building and improving Travis CI for all of you. We’re happy to answer any questions on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.community/t/travis-ci-joins-the-idera-family/1975&quot;&gt;Community Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Image: CERN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/news/press-release/accelerators/international-collaboration-publishes-concept-design-post-lhc&quot;&gt;CERN’s press release of plans for a larger particle collider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/01/particle-physicists-want-money-for.html&quot;&gt;which I wrote about last week&lt;/a&gt;, made international headlines. Unfortunately, most articles about the topic just repeat the press-release, and do not explain how much the situation in particle physics has changed with the LHC data.&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1960s, when physicists hit on the “particle zoo” at nuclear energies, they always had a good reason to build a larger collider. That’s because their theories of elementary matter were incomplete. But now, with the Higgs-boson found in 2012, their theory – the “standard model of particle physics” – is complete. It’s done. There’s nothing missing. All Pokemon caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Higgs was the last good prediction that particle physicists had. This prediction dates back to the 1960s and it was based on sound mathematics. In contrast to this, the current predictions for new particles at a larger collider – eg supersymmetric partner particles or dark matter particles – are not based on sound mathematics. These predictions are based on what is called an “argument from naturalness” and those arguments are little more than wishful thinking dressed in equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have laid out my reasoning for why those predictions are no good in great detail in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray/dp/0465094252/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=backreactio08-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w00&amp;amp;linkId=59df19c0086385d0bc113ffe2b03478a&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465094252&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; (and also in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02176&quot;&gt;this little paper&lt;/a&gt;). But it does not matter whether you believe (or even understand) my arguments, you only have to look at the data to see that particle physicists’ predictions for physics beyond the standard model have, in fact, not worked for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact is, particle physicists have predicted dark matter particles since the mid-1980s. None of those have been seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fact is, particle physicists predicted grand unified theories starting also in the 1980s. To the extent that those can be ruled out, they have been ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact is, they predicted that supersymmetric particles and/or large additional dimensions of space should become observable at the LHC. &lt;a href=&quot;http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/12/how-lhc-may-spell-end-of-particle.html&quot;&gt;According to those predictions, this should have happened already&lt;/a&gt;. It did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing is now that those demonstrably flawed methods were the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason to think the LHC should discover something fundamentally new besides the Higgs. With this method of prediction not working, there is now no reason to think that the LHC in its upcoming runs, or a next larger collider, will see anything besides the physics predicted by the already known theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it may happen. I am not saying that I know a larger collider will not find something new. It is possible that we get lucky. I am simply saying that we currently have no prediction that indicates a larger collider would lead to a breakthrough. The standard model may well be it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation is unprecedented in particle physics. The only reliable prediction we currently have for physics beyond the standard model is that we should eventually see effects of quantum gravity. But for that we would have to reach energies 13 orders of magnitude higher than what even the next collider would deliver. It’s way out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing we can reliably say a next larger collider will do is measure more precisely the properties of the already known fundamental particles. That it may tell us something about dark matter, or dark energy, or the matter-antimatter symmetry is a hope, not a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particle physicists had a good case to build the LHC with the prediction of the Higgs-boson. But with the Higgs found, the next larger collider has no good motivation. The year is 2019, not 1999.
