<title>Email from Jeff Bezos to employees</title>
<link>https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Fellow Amazonians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’s, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it’s working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you’re proud of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you’ve been humble. When times have been tough, you’ve been strong and supportive, and we’ve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we’ve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian’s idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we’re flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Framework for Writing Better Documentation</title>
<link>https://documentation.divio.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://documentation.divio.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-documentation-system&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;- David Laing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;/em&gt;, there are four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are: &lt;em&gt;tutorials&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;how-to guides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;technical reference&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt;. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;about-the-system&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the system&lt;a class=&quot;headerlink&quot; href=&quot;https://documentation.divio.com/#about-the-system&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this headline&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;'overview of the documentation system'&quot; src=&quot;https://documentation.divio.com/_images/overview.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentation system outlined here is a simple, comprehensive and nearly universally-applicable scheme. It is proven in practice across a wide variety of fields and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some very simple principles that govern documentation that are very rarely if ever spelled out. They seem to be a secret, though they shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can put these principles into practice, &lt;strong&gt;it will make your documentation better and your project, product or team more successful&lt;/strong&gt; - that’s a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;https://documentation.divio.com/adoption/#adoption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;std std-ref&quot;&gt;The system is widely adopted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for large and small, open and proprietary documentation projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Getting better at Linux with mini-projects</title>
<link>https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020-11-28 Carl Riis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you advance your Linux skills when you are already comfortable with the basics? My solution was to come up with 10 subjects to learn and create an accompanying mini-project.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the source code for the projects can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carltheperson/10-things-linux&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to learn more about was UNIX since Linux is a UNIX-like operating system. I also never really felt that I fully understood what exactly UNIX was, besides being a family of fairly similar operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX. I also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; original paper written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from 1974, which was really interesting though I can’t say I understood all of it. After some more reading and some Youtube videos, I felt comfortable that I understood what UNIX was, and what makes it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project, I decided to try and write my first C program. Following the Unix philosophy, I made sure that it did one thing only. That thing ended up being a program that reverses the contents of a text file. Since this is just a reverse version of &lt;em&gt;cat&lt;/em&gt;, I called the program &lt;em&gt;recat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/1_UNIX__Recat/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What is a shell? - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell&quot;&gt;SeaShell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, I was curious to find out what exactly a shell was. Even though it is something that I use often, I was still confused about what differentiates it from the terminal. Turns out it’s really not that complicated. I learned this by rereading the &lt;em&gt;shell&lt;/em&gt; part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; from the previous project, and some explanations online like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. The Unix shell Wikipedia entry was also very informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this project is about the shell, I found it appropriate to try and write my own. I settled on the name &lt;em&gt;SeaShell&lt;/em&gt;, which I found way too funny. It’s not very advanced, but it does the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Ownership and permissions - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess&quot;&gt;Tellaccess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the things that I know is really important for Linux, but have never really understood. I have tried before but never been able to get the knowledge to stick, maybe because I didn't really care about security until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ownership and permission system turned out to be really intuitive, and I was able to understand the basics from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one article. I later discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from Linux Handbook which was more comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project, I decided to create a program that tells you in human-readable form, the ownership and permissions of a file. I called the project &lt;em&gt;tellaccess&lt;/em&gt; because it tells you who can access the file in what ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn. Since &lt;em&gt;grep&lt;/em&gt; is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first. This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the &lt;em&gt;POSIX Basic Regular Expressions&lt;/em&gt;, which is not that common. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions&quot;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; was a lifesaver. Besides that, I also used the man page for &lt;em&gt;grep&lt;/em&gt; as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game. In the game, you get a folder full of files, and it’s your job to extract information. I called the game &lt;em&gt;Grep detective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/4_Grep__Grep_detective/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sed&lt;/em&gt; are more of the UNIX magic that I have always thought was really cool, though I never really understood what they were used for. I often saw answers on Stack Overflow with people using them in crazy one-liners, but I always copy-pasted them without much thought. Well, time to unravel the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mijp1/teaching/2nd_year_Comp_Lab/guides/grep_awk_sed.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper to learn about them. For the project, I wanted to create my own one-liner that shows information about the users on your system in a clear way. I found just reading the &lt;em&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/em&gt; a little too messy, so the project &lt;em&gt;passwdinfo&lt;/em&gt;, displays the most important information in a neat table. I found information about the &lt;em&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/em&gt; file &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important tool I never really got around to learning. Learning how to use &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; was fairly easy, it was mostly about memorizing the different flags, and the format you set the flags in. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project, I created a treasure hunt where you look for clues in files with different attributes. I first wrote a script that created a bunch of small files and directories as noise. Then a selected few of the files got clues to the whereabouts of the other ones. In the end, you find the treasure, which I won’t tell you what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I executed my first &lt;em&gt;ls /&lt;/em&gt; I have wondered what all those directories were for. Time to unveil the mystery. The first thing I did was read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article as it explained each directory in root and provided a nice graph. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; resource was also nice since it had a table that summed up each directory in one or two sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project ended up being a program that gives you descriptions for directories in your own root folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/7_File_system__Root_tour/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes are another important element of Linux that I have never gotten around to learning. Like many other subjects I have covered here, it turned out to be fairly intuitive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; article was really easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contemplating for a while what kind of project I could create but ultimately came up with a command that prints all processes that don’t belong to you or root. That way, you can keep a close eye on who is creating processes. Note, there are many legitimate reasons that other users would run processes on your system, and it rarely means someone has gained access to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/8_Processes__Stranger_danger/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I try to set up a database on a Linux machine I have been confused about how to configure the &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; service. I have also been in situations where I needed to create a service from a binary but always struggled. The struggle ends now. As with any new subject, it’s always a good idea to read the Wikipedia page, so that is where I started. Surprisingly, I learned that &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; is a quite controversial piece of software, but I still wanted to learn it and judge it for myself. For understanding the basics of &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and for understanding how to create a new service I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tecmint.com/create-new-service-units-in-systemd/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project, I made &lt;em&gt;createservice&lt;/em&gt;, which allows you to make a &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; service from any executable that will automatically start up on boot. Here I test it out on Prometheus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/9_Systemd_services__Createservice/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bash scripting is something I have been avoiding for a long time. Partly because I believe that my programming language of choice, Go, is almost as handy when it comes to scripting, and partly because I think that Bash syntax looks horrible. Can’t knock it till you try it, so here I am trying to learn Bash scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; was a nice introduction, and after finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://devhints.io/bash&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; cool cheatsheet I felt comfortable trying to create a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project ended up being a cipher program I called &lt;em&gt;Penguin cipher&lt;/em&gt; after Linux’s mascot. It allows you to encrypt text into something like this: &lt;em&gt;MTExIDIxMSAzMTMgNDAyIDQ2OCA0NjQgMTU5IDI0MSAyMzAgMzY3IDM3NCA1MjYgMTM3IDIyMiAyOTUgMzYzIDQzNCA0MzUg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>20k honey bees took over a tech company’s empty office during lockdown</title>
<link>https://qz.com/work/1965925/20000-honey-bees-took-over-a-tech-office-during-covid-19/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/work/1965925/20000-honey-bees-took-over-a-tech-office-during-covid-19/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;On the main drag of sunny Santa Barbara, California, four blocks from the Pacific Ocean, sits the three-story headquarters of Invoca, an artificial-intelligence software company. Like many offices, the building has been empty since March, when Invoca sent employees home to shelter from Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;Well, not quite empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;For amidst the building’s abandoned desks and silent phones, 20,000 honey bees were hard at work, building a hive filled with 10 gallons’ worth of honey, beeswax, and pollen, as Invoca’s leadership learned in January, much to their surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;“We were talking a lot as an executive team about how and when to bring people back to the office and how to make sure it’s safe,” says Dee Anna McPherson, Invoca’s chief marketing officer. “It never occurred to me to think of bees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;It never does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_2BmSp&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_57zR9&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/honeycomb.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=450&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;honeycomb covered in bees&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Bee Rescue &amp;amp; Removal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The discovery.
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;Looking back, though, there were clues. Invoca’s workplace experience manager had noticed a few dead bees in the entrance hall when she first stopped by the office in April to get the mail. “She didn’t think a whole lot of it,” says McPherson, “just, &lt;em&gt;Oh, they must have somehow blown in&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;The next month, the office manager saw a few more dead bees. And then more and more. Finally, Invoca decided it was time to investigate, calling in Santa Barbara’s local &lt;a href=&quot;https://superbeerescue.com/&quot;&gt;Super Bee Rescue &amp;amp; Removal&lt;/a&gt; squad, which, true to its name, specializes in safely re-homing honey bees that have chosen impractical places to set up shop. “We consider ourselves bee-vangilists,” says owner Nick Wigle, who doubles as a beekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;Using a thermal imaging camera, Super Bee’s technician located the bee colony nested between the building’s second and third floors. “So they cut a hole in the ceiling and she had to shimmy up between the floors,” McPherson says. It took the better part of a day for Super Bee to attract the bees into a box, using the scent of a queen bee to lure them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_2BmSp&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_57zR9&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/a8a96446-d157-4895-8cbd-cf6091f87c13.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=450&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;bee hive built into wall&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Bee Rescue &amp;amp; Removal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The bees set up an office of their own.
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;A crucial part of the rescue process, Wigle notes, is spotting and capturing the queen bee, upon whom the survival of the other bees depends. “Without her, there will be no future baby bees—and if not replaced, the colony will be dead in a few weeks,” he says. Luckily, the queen bee has a few distinctive traits; she’s about 10% to 15% bigger than the other bees, and has a fully developed abdomen for laying eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;Initially, McPherson says, Invoca had hoped to process the bees’ honey and give jars of it to employees. But Super Bee explained that it tries to preserve the honeycomb, so that the bees can rebuild their hive when they’re relocated to a natural habitat. Invoca did get a plate-sized piece of the honeycomb as a souvenir, which a couple of employees divvied up to sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;The bees are a reminder of just how long we’ve been away from our offices—long enough that nature may have more surprises in store for companies as they begin to reopen their workspaces. Their legacy lives on in Invoca’s Slack channel, where employees have been abuzz with puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;“Everyone’s like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, they’re our new employ-bees&lt;/em&gt;,” says McPherson. “Or, &lt;em&gt;Our office has become an AirBeeandBee&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;But the removal itself was a serious matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cyhZ9&quot;&gt;“Our CEO actually is allergic to bee stings,” McPherson notes. “He has to carry an Epipen. So it’s kind of a fun thing to think about the bees, but it’s really important that we get them out of there.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;m tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/02/Anti-Wayland-horseshit.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/02/Anti-Wayland-horseshit.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;What do anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, 9/11 truthers, and anti-Wayland activism all have in common? All of them are characterized by a blithe rejection of facts to embrace a narrative of victimization by a vague authority. In the case of Wayland, the “vague authority” are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you. “Wayland sucks!” is a conspiracy theory with no basis in truth, and its supporters have spent years harassing Wayland maintainers, contributors, and users. And it’s time for it to fucking stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Wayland doesn’t work for your precious use-case. More likely, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work, and you swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which might have been correct 7 years ago. Regardless, I simply don’t give a shit about you anymore. I’ve tried appealing to reason and rationally debunking each lie that some Wayland detractor flavor-of-the-week is touting to tow the party line, but it didn’t work. So my new approach is “fuck you”. None of the Wayland detractors have a clue. They don’t understand Wayland, they don’t understand X11, they don’t understand Linux graphics or OpenGL or Vulkan or anything else in the stack. They don’t even understand what it’s like to use Wayland, because at most they might have spent 5 minutes installing it, realized that something was — gasp — &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than X11, and then uninstalled it and wrote their angry Reddit comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a real cost, you know, being a dick to maintainers. It’s not good for our mental health. We’re out here trying to make things better. Wayland fixes unfixable problems with X11, and might have invented some new, fixable problems in the process — most of which have been fucking fixed already, and years ago! We’ve sacrificed our spare time to build this for you for free. If you turn around and harass us based on some utterly nonsensical conspiracy theories, then you’re a fucking asshole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to live in your propagandized world of Wayland lies, then fine. You’re gonna maintain Xorg yourself, because we’re not going to volunteer our time, sacrifice our weekends and evenings staying up late for your sake, just to maintain that broken pile of shit. You know what, if you fork it and prove that you know what you’re doing for a while, we’d probably just give you the keys to upstream so you can maintain it yourself. If you do know what you’re doing, though, you’ll soon realize you want nothing to do with that shitty codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayland works for almost everyone, and works for &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people than is even possible with X11. Most of the lies you’ve heard about ways that it’s broken are just that: lies. And if you insist on living in that fantasy, then keep it to yourself, asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AirPods Max: An Audiophile Review</title>
<link>https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-max</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-max</guid>
<description>&lt;a class=&quot;small date left margin&quot; href=&quot;https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-max&quot;&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Surprising sound let down by serious comfort problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=6b8a0daf46384709fee2520ad544cdff&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m conflicted about Apple’s latest foray into audio products, the AirPods Max over-ear headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In striking opposition to every other review I’ve seen so far, I get to begin mine by stating that I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; an audiophile. A friendly, reasonable one, but still—&lt;a href=&quot;https://mariusmasalar.me/plague-inc-the-cure&quot;&gt;audio is my jam&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been writing music for games and film for over 10 years, so one would hope that I’ve learned a thing or two about audio production in that time. It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has had a long and fruitful relationship with music, but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products. Beats are a common entry point into the world of audio, but they’re priced the way they are because of their brand power, not because their quality justifies it. You can get much better sound, comfort, features, and build for less money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I find myself wondering to what extent that is also true for the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having forked over just under $900 &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; for the privilege of owning a pair, I wanted to see whether Apple is aiming to establish itself as a purveyor of quality audio gear—deserving of a high price tag—or whether we’ll once again be paying for style over substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-5.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=3b6c49e79651f9f936486a7886ff54db&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed when I pulled the AirPods Max out of their box. I knew they would be heavy, but the experience of that weight is really something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, the Sennheiser &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;PXC&lt;/span&gt; 550—my current headphone choice for travel—weigh 227g. The famously comfortable Bose 700 weigh 254g, a weight that’s matched by the popular Sony WH-1000XM4. Premium pairs like the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;H9&lt;/span&gt; (third generation) weigh 295g, and the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;PX7&lt;/span&gt; just barely crest the 300g mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AirPods Max weigh &lt;em&gt;385g&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that the iPhone 12’s aluminum build &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; less fancy but &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; nicer in use than its Pro counterparts and their stainless steel, the mostly-metal build of the AirPods Max is a choice that favours fashion over comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that other high-end headphone manufacturers lean heavily on plastic and even wood in their builds isn’t that they can’t afford metal. It’s because they’re interested in having human beings wear these products on their heads for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one such human being with a head, I wish Apple had taken some cues from the competition on this front. Even after adjusting the way I wear them, I can’t escape the fact that these are just plain &lt;em&gt;uncomfortable&lt;/em&gt; for long listening sessions. The mesh headband and foam ear cups do their best to mitigate this, but they can’t compensate for the sheer weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headband is terrific. It may be my favourite approach to one that I’ve seen on a headphone. I have to wear the band further back on my head than I do with other headphones, but once I figured that out I was able to wear them for longer before needing a break. The ear cups are less impressive. They’re spacious and fairly well padded, but the material that’s used feels somewhat cheap and scratchy in texture. I suspect it’s more breathable than typical leather or vinyl ear cups, but the physical impression isn’t as good and I don’t particularly like how they feel on my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the clamping force, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strong; AirPods Max squeeze your head like a musical bear hug. This is a common problem with heavy headphones, so I wasn’t surprised to see it here, but it accounts for the majority of the comfort problems I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure points will differ depending on your fit, but I offered these to two other people in my vicinity for some extended listening and both reported discomfort; one on the top of their head, the other around their ears where the clamp force put pressure on the jaw. Personally, I experience it mainly as a headache after about the half hour to one hour mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s disregard weight for a moment, though. These are fine for shorter listening sessions and everyone’s head is different, so I’m sure there are folks out there who will find them to be perfectly comfortable. The problems with metal go beyond weight: by prioritizing fashion value over practical value, Apple has committed a series of unforced errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anodized aluminum feels nice and soft, but that softness means they scuff easily…like, say, when you fold them flat and notice that the ear cups bump and scratch against each other. This happens all the time and it makes me cringe every time; it’s like the horrible scraping that iMac users will be familiar with from trying to plug something into the rear ports. Also, parts of the world experience a season called winter, where the temperature drops and metal surfaces become dangerous things your skin will stick to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, about that &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;protective case”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-8.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=392ed93e8e6a65298b215cf68f228603&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to save myself some typing and point you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Gvvo6vUpJRc?t=639&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the part of &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;MKBHD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-single&quot;&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s review video&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about the storage solution that these $900 headphones ship with. Go ahead and give that a watch. Back? Great. What he said. Before getting these, I thought the hate for the case was hyperbolic, but the truth is it really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; feel cheap and pointless, particularly after &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple clarified&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t necessary for putting the headphones into standby mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we leave the topic of their physical design, I want to share one last complaint about the AirPods Max: the buttons. I don’t mind the feel of them myself (though a friend felt they were cheap and unpleasant), but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mind the way they work. The Digital Crown, which controls volume, is also the button that controls playback and Siri. The other, larger button is used to switch between the listening modes: Active Noise Cancellation (&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt;), Transparency mode, and none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate having physical controls for these things, but I intuitively expected that all the audio-related functions would be accessed from one button and that the playback and feature controls would be accessed from the other. Tying playback controls to the volume knob feels strange to me, and increases the chances of unintentional volume changes when you’re trying to execute a double or triple press—something made even trickier if you’re wearing gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, naturally, no way to configure these button assignments. At best, you’re able to change the scrolling direction of the volume knob and restrict which listening modes the other button switches between, but that’s about it. That latter feature also seems to be buggy in the current firmware (&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;3C16&lt;/span&gt;) because despite enabling all three, I find that it defaults back to just Noise Cancellation or Transparency whenever I reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal-breaker? No. But another strange design choice to wrap up this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-7.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=f6b19d4c7ef961a06df1a759fc2f45b5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, one more complaint: the battery life is the shortest of any headphone in this category. This isn’t an issue in and of itself considering they’ll still last through a full day of listening. Still, I hoped that some of that excess size and weight would translate into battery capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of power, Apple has indicated that the AirPods Max have two low-power states and you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; need the case to access them—great news since I refuse to use that stupid thing. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what they say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set your AirPods Max down and leave them stationary for 5 minutes, they go into a low power mode to preserve battery charge. After 72 stationary hours out of the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into a lower power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My to preserve battery charge further. If you put your AirPods Max in the Smart Case when you’re not using them, they go into a low power mode immediately to preserve battery charge. After 18 hours in the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into an ultralow power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My and maximizes battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I’m done talking about the physical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sonic-boom&quot;&gt;Sonic Boom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, shaking my head at the weight and the design while I got them connected. I was already looking up Apple’s holiday return policy when I hit play on my usual suite of test material and…oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-4.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=a34de6bb9c7c71b5c5ccbfad05e1c8f6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of &lt;a href=&quot;http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-bowers-wilkins-p7-wireless-headphones-review/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the first time&lt;/a&gt; a pair of wireless headphones impressed me. I put them on and somehow found myself lying on the floor of my room, two hours later, having become completely lost in the music. Since then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mariusmasalar.me/bang-olufsen-h9i&quot;&gt;other headphones&lt;/a&gt; have achieved this magical time-dilation effect, but I didn’t expect to feel it coming from an Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, Apple has amazing audio engineers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-pro&quot;&gt;I adore my AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not the best value for money in terms of sound, but they have a pleasant, relatively neutral profile and have become my daily listening companions. Similarly, the HomePod is my favourite smart speaker for sound because it manages to provide a remarkably full and dynamic listening experience for a compact mono sound source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, the AirPods Max sound &lt;em&gt;sublime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a beautiful way of making you feel immersed and enveloped by the music, with a tremendously wide soundstage, solid instrument placement, and some of the most articulate dynamics I’ve heard from consumer equipment. They remind me of my open-back studio headphone and amp setup (the geeky audiophile equipment) more than other wireless headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours of listening later, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just experiencing some sort of hallucination caused by the extreme clamping force of these metallic behemoths, so I called up my friend and had him bring over his pair of Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen H9i—&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/articles/a-roundup-of-the-best-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-headphones/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my previous benchmark&lt;/a&gt; for best wireless &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt; headphones—to do some critical listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cruised through our respective music libraries, selecting favourite tracks and listening, each of us with one of the pairs on. Then we’d swap &lt;a href=&quot;https://atp.fm/409&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(as others have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this is the only reliable way to compare headphones because we have terrible memory for audio). We went back and forth like this for a few hours and I found myself increasingly bewildered by the experience of hearing the AirPods make the H9i sound a bit congested, closed in, and lacklustre by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I threw my most demanding tracks at them, including some of my own music. After all, judging headphones by the way other people’s music sounds is inherently subjective; I might prefer one rendition over another, but I have no insight into which best represents the artist’s intent. When I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the artist though, I can make objective assessments. And my assessment is simple: given the choice, I’d rather have someone listen to my work on the AirPods Max than the H9i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not supposed to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even get to hook them up to my amp and listen to my lossless music collection yet (mainly because they sell the required cable separately and haven’t I already spent enough on this?!) The audiophile association is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; going to kick me out for this! I’ll have to return my adamantium cables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-2.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=f5be1e2e5dfd6ac704667e83e3c188d0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;smoke-and-mirrors&quot;&gt;Smoke And Mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but wait. Now I put my audiophile hat back on and pull back the curtain to reveal: it’s fake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, much of that magical soundstage is in fact manufactured by the headphones’ Digital Signal Processing (&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;DSP&lt;/span&gt;). The same technology that enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/spatial-audio-automatic-switching-and-other-new-audio-features-in-ios-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spatial Audio&lt;/a&gt; to work also allows Apple to artificially enhance the sense of space and re-balance the sound to remain steady and clean even at very high and very low volumes. Those dual &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;H1&lt;/span&gt; chips are working hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also where my review became very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re dealing with DSP-based sonic enhancements—especially ones like this that are actively tuned based on the shape of your head, your environment, etc.—different people will very literally hear different things. Already, I’m seeing commentary from audiophile reviewers saying that the &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;DSP&lt;/span&gt; is horrible, ruining the balance of music. And those people may well be correct for their listening environment. I can’t judge their experience because it’s so dependent on factors that can’t be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the end result is that the AirPods Max sound better than any other headphone in their category that I’ve tried, does it matter that they achieve that partially through software? I’ll further threaten my audiophile credentials here and say: nope. I don’t think it matters! In the same way that a good photo is a good photo whether I shot it on my camera or had my iPhone cobble it together from multiple frames and computational trickery, the end result is still a photo I’m happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the hardware aspects that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be judged objectively are…objectively good: the dynamic drivers are clearly well-designed, with incredibly low distortion and plenty of power. They aren’t using any fancy planar magnetic technology, but that makes sense for this kind of headphone. Score one for the hardware team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I can say this: if you’re lucky, have the right shaped head, or are otherwise blessed by the &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;DSP&lt;/span&gt; experience gods, the AirPods Max have the potential to outshine every other pair of headphones in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-much-needed-context&quot;&gt;Some Much-Needed Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, the trouble is that I spent almost $900 on these. And if you’re willing to drop that kind of cash on audio equipment, you already have access to an entirely different tier of experience than what you can get in this wireless &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt; headphone category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider: my audiophile listening setup, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; modest, consists of a pair of acclaimed but contextually low-end studio headphones—the MassDrop/Sennheiser &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; 6XX)—connected to a &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;JDS&lt;/span&gt; Labs Atom amplifier that’s boosting a signal prepared by the Topping &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;D30&lt;/span&gt; Digital-to-Analog Converter (&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;DAC&lt;/span&gt;). Total cost of equipment? A little under $600 &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;. If I were to strip out the latter two elements and keep just the headphones, I’d &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have better sound than the AirPods Max and only be out about $300 &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you say, what’s the downside? Why would I ever bother to buy other headphones? Well, the above setup wins on sound and comfort, but it’s wired, it doesn’t fold or pack down in any way, and it has no noise-cancelling, spatial audio, or other fancy features. It’s a setup for dedicated listening that you enjoy at home. It’s been well-used during the pandemic, that’s for sure, but under normal circumstances I want to bring some of that sonic beauty with me when I travel, commute, go on walks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; why the wireless &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt; headphone category exists, and it’s those extra features and portability affordances that you tend to pay for. The challenge, then, is to see how much of the sonic prowess of a studio setup you can bring with you while prioritizing comfort and carry, all while suddenly having to contend with connectivity and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with this category is that it seems inherently limited. If you’re taking these out into the world and listening while trying to cancel the sound of traffic, coffee shops, etc. then how focused are you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; on the nuances of the music? Most people rarely take the opportunity to do any &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisbowler.com/deep-listening/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;focused listening&lt;/a&gt;, and when we do it probably isn’t during our noisy commute or while at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, that imposes a sort of ceiling on how much it’s worth spending here. Not because you can’t find good sound, but because that sound can’t be appreciated in the situations where you’re most likely to be using the headphones. You’ll probably notice easier packing, longer battery life, or better noise cancellation before you notice the subtleties of how one pair plays music compared to another. They’re just different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, most people are only going to own a single pair of headphones, so if those headphones can offer both the conveniences of the portable category and some of the sound of their sedentary counterparts, then it may be worth the extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question becomes which set of compromises you prefer to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-6.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=177c383799b3e7385d20362ab9a809e4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;noise-cancellation-transparency-and-spatial-audio&quot;&gt;Noise Cancellation, Transparency, and Spatial Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re 2,000 words in here—how’re you holding up? I’ve had the AirPods Max on my head listening to stuff as I’ve been writing this and I have to take them off…my head needs a break. The discomfort is real, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to wind down this review with a discussion of the special features that the AirPods Max bring to the table. Some, like &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt; and transparency mode, are available on basically all of their competitors and I can be brief about them: they’re best-in-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, the noise-cancelling is just as good as Sony’s. It’s not necessarily tuned the same, as every manufacturer has a different approach, but the efficacy is absolutely comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, the transparency mode is the best I’ve heard on over-ear headphones. It almost feels like you’re wearing open-back headphones, that’s how good it is. That being said, if Transparency mode is a primary factor in your decision-making, keep in mind that the AirPods Pro are better at it—it makes sense since they don’t have to work around having your entire ear covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to the H1-specific features like proprietary pairing and auto-switching capabilities with Apple devices, Spatial Audio, and the ability to split a connection to one device with another pair of &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;H1&lt;/span&gt; devices (AirPods, some Beats models) so two people can listen at once, each with independent volume control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all appealing features, but the truth is that none of them would sway my decision individually. The quick pairing is a one-time advantage, so that’s basically negligible. The auto-switching is great but in my usage it’s only been reliable when switching between iOS devices, not macOS ones. And if you aren’t constantly switching devices then it’s going to be entirely lost on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Spatial Audio, it’s a very cool effect but it’s currently too limited to be of much interest. It only works for surround sources and only if the app supports it (which major ones like Netflix and Prime still don’t). It also requires your playback device to be equipped with positioning sensors, which only iOS devices are. If you want to try it out on a Mac or, more likely, your Apple &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; then you’re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is baffling because it means that your only way of experiencing the purported &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;cinematic” experience of Spatial Audio is by staring at a tiny screen while doing it. This is clearly just a matter of time—I’m convinced the next Apple &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; will be compatible—but meanwhile it feels hamstrung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;value&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t like talking about cost in my reviews because it’s not my place to weigh in on how others spend their money. Plus, even if these were truly awful headphones, people would still buy them in droves because they’re made by Apple and are probably going to become fashion icons (see: Beats). I have no issue with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to discuss &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; for the folks who aren’t as immersed in the audio world, who don’t really know the brands and options, and who simply want to get themselves a nice pair of headphones. Perhaps they want to step up from their Beats, or they want to go from earbuds to over-ear headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, those people should be aware that the AirPods Max represent terrible value if your main goal is to get an intelligent balance between comfort, sound, longevity, &lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ANC&lt;/span&gt;, and style. They’re too heavy to be comfortable, they don’t fold or have a reasonable case to protect them when you’re travelling, and a lot of their sonic advantages are going to be lost on you if you’re mostly using them on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an audience for AirPods Max? Well…yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who actually makes time for focused listening, who knows you’ll be using them mostly at home, who needs the convenience of wireless, who will eventually make use of Spatial Audio a lot, who tends to take listening breaks every hour or so to avoid fatigue, and who’s willing to pay a lot of money to own a single pair of headphones that can cover almost any ground, the AirPods Max may well be the best choice on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if comfort, portability, and practicality are your priorities, then the competing headphones from Sony, Sennheiser, and Bose are a much wiser purchase at a much lower price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if sound quality eclipses all other criteria for you and you don’t care about wireless use, then you’re looking at the wrong category of product altogether; you’ll want to head over to the headphones subreddit or one of the many friendly audiophile forums out there and ask for some advice on how to get started. Ironically, you’ll end up paying &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; money than either of the two groups above—at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-3.jpg?auto=compress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;fit=clip&amp;amp;w=1500&amp;amp;s=5837e7f9c06f6bf46a3898610829be14&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I hate these stupid headphones because so much of their physical design is flawed…but they sound &lt;em&gt;so wonderful&lt;/em&gt; that I can’t help but smile whenever I listen to things through them. At least until my head starts hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you, but there are many other aspects that I could spend &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; thousand words on: the microphone quality, Headphone Accommodations, headband fragility, battery replacement, third party accessory potential, etc…I have a lot to say about the AirPods Max because they inspire passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They frustrate me because you can tell that these could have been disruptively perfect. If Apple had made them lighter, chosen better materials, made them fold properly, given them a useable case, included the damn 3.5mm audio cable—even if they’d kept the price—the AirPods Max would be an easy recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is though, I have no idea who I would recommend these to. I think anyone—even audiophiles—should find a way to audition them just for fun. But actually dropping this much money to own a pair? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I bought them because I had to know what the company’s first true foray into this category would look like. Now I know. And the intelligent, wise, and financially savvy side of me should hastily pack them up and give them back…before the other side of me gets lost in the music again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Just because I have a vertical screen doesn’t mean I’m on a phone</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/02/just-because-i-have-a-vertical-screen-doesnt-mean-im-on-a-phone/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/02/just-because-i-have-a-vertical-screen-doesnt-mean-im-on-a-phone/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a weirdo – I fully admit that. As part of my home working set up, I use a vertical monitor. I read and write a lot of long documents – and this form factor suits me perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vertical-Screen-showing-YouTube.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vertical Screen showing YouTube.&quot; width=&quot;255&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-34758&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edent/status/1206586972&quot;&gt;for a long time&lt;/a&gt;. It is a natural part of my workflow. For anything longer than an email, it’s the perfect orientation. Most Linux apps work just fine like this – although menu buttons tend to hide behind overflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites though, ah! That’s where the problem begins. Lots of websites think “Vertical Screen == Mobile User”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a minor problem – and one of my own making – but I thought it worth explaining the problems it brings, why it occurs, &amp;amp; how to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some typical websites viewed on my 24″ vertical monitor. On the left if how it renders, and on the right how it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/montje50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Just Eat website.&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-38009&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/montgu50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guardian News website.&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-38010&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/montps50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Popular science website.&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-38011&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there are several problems I encounter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigation is hidden behind a burger / ☰ menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some elements, like carousels, only work with touchscreen controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images are served as low resolution, for 6 inch screens and then blown up to 24 inches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of wasted space taken up with “hero images” and finger-friendly buttons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some content simply not available to mobile users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this occurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My monitor’s native resolution is 1080×1920. But I find the fonts slightly too small at that resolution – given how far I sit from the screen. I use Pop_OS Linux, which lets me scale the fonts rather than the screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-25-15-09-23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gnome Tweaks screenshot showing a font scaling factor.&quot; width=&quot;1044&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-37933&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scale factor of 1.5 translates to an effective screen resolution of 720×1280.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent&quot;&gt;User Agent “sniffing” is considered an antipattern&lt;/a&gt; and is discouraged. So most websites don’t bother to check if I’m browsing on an iPhone or Android, instead, they use JavaScript or CSS to get my screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They – somewhat reasonably – see a 720p screen in a vertical orientation and assume it is a small screen device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to tackle this (user side)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom out! That’s the obvious answer. If I hit &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;-&lt;/kbd&gt; 3 times, my resolution becomes 1080×1920. But that can leave some sites too small to read properly. I need to zoom out the page, and zoom in the font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried “Fractional Scaling” – it works OK on Wayland, but leaves all the fonts looking soft and fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve set my font scaling to 1.36, which gives me a resolution of 864×1536 – which is enough to stop most sites assuming I’m on a tiny mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this shouldn’t be my problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to tackle this (website side)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STOP NAÏVELY USING SCREEN RESOLUTION!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, there’s no way to get the &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; size of a user’s screen. That functionality just doesn’t exist in either JavaScript or CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can get the Dots Per Inch (DPI). Well, sort of…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resolution&quot;&gt;CSS allows you to get the DPI of the screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I go to Lea Verou’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dpi.lv/&quot;&gt;https://DPI.lv/&lt;/a&gt; I see that my monitor’s resolution is correctly detected as 1080×1920! No matter what zoom level or font scaling I use – it is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the correct resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;var dppx = window.devicePixelRatio;
var screenWidth  = screen.width  * dppx;
var screenHeight = screen.height * dppx;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how you get the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; resolution, unencumbered by whatever the OS is doing to the scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infobyip.com/detectmonitordpi.php&quot;&gt;a different DPI detector&lt;/a&gt;, I can see exactly how many pixels there are per inch. My vertical monitor is detected as 120px/inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; right. And different browser engines calculate this differently. On Linux, I got these results with the three main rendering engines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome: 5.14px/mm.&lt;br/&gt;Firefox: 4.73px/mm.&lt;br/&gt;Webkit: 3.78px/mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I physically measure the screen, it’s about 3.62px/mm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that’s not incredibly accurate – but it is useful in giving a web developer a &lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt; idea of physical screen size.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>I’m a weirdo – I fully admit that. As part of my home working set up, I use a vertical monitor. I read and write a lot of long documents – and this form factor suits me perfectly.…</og:description>
