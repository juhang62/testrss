&lt;p&gt;PostgREST is a standalone web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API. The structural constraints and permissions in the database determine the API endpoints and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using PostgREST is an alternative to manual CRUD programming. Custom API servers suffer problems. Writing business logic often duplicates, ignores or hobbles database structure. Object-relational mapping is a leaky abstraction leading to slow imperative code. The PostgREST philosophy establishes a single declarative source of truth: the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;declarative-programming&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to ask PostgreSQL to join data for you and let its query planner figure out the details than to loop through rows yourself. It’s easier to assign permissions to db objects than to add guards in controllers. (This is especially true for cascading permissions in data dependencies.) It’s easier to set constraints than to litter code with sanity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;leak-proof-abstraction&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no ORM involved. Creating new views happens in SQL with known performance implications. A database administrator can now create an API from scratch with no custom programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;one-thing-well&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgREST has a focused scope. It works well with other tools like Nginx. This forces you to cleanly separate the data-centric CRUD operations from other concerns. Use a collection of sharp tools rather than building a big ball of mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;getting-support&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has a friendly and growing community.

&lt;p&gt;Explanations of some key concepts in PostgREST.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ecosystem&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgREST has a growing ecosystem of examples, libraries, and experiments. Here is a selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;release-notes&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we’ll include the most relevant changes so you can migrate to newer versions easily. You can see the full changelog of each release in the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases&quot;&gt;PostgREST repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;in-production&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some companies that use PostgREST in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;testimonials&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so fast to develop, it feels like cheating!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;—François-G. Ribreau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just have to say that, the CPU/Memory usage compared to our Node.js/Waterline ORM based API is ridiculous. It’s hard to even push it over 60/70 MB while our current API constantly hits 1GB running on 6 instances (dynos).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;—Louis Brauer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really enjoyed the fact that all of a sudden I was writing microservices in SQL DDL (and v8 javascript functions). I dodged so much boilerplate. The next thing I knew, we pulled out a full rewrite of a Spring+MySQL legacy app in 6 months. Literally 10x faster, and code was super concise. The old one took 3 years and a team of 4 people to develop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;—Simone Scarduzio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like the fact that PostgREST does one thing, and one thing well. While PostgREST takes care of bridging the gap between our HTTP server and PostgreSQL database, we can focus on the development of our API in a single language: SQL. This puts the database in the center of our architecture, and pushed us to improve our skills in SQL programming and database design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;—Eric Bréchemier, Data Engineer, eGull SAS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PostgREST is performant, stable, and transparent. It allows us to bootstrap projects really fast, and to focus on our data and application instead of building out the ORM layer. In our k8s cluster, we run a few pods per schema we want exposed, and we scale up/down depending on demand. Couldn’t be happier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;—Anupam Garg, Datrium, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has a reputation for not being so great when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soranews24.com/2019/10/11/english-reactions-to-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-japanese-salaryman-video-sadden-japanese-netizens/&quot;&gt;work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s a reputation that makes sense, considering the country &lt;strong&gt;routinely scores toward the bottom&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soranews24.com/2013/06/19/japan-second-worst-in-g8-for-employee-satisfaction/&quot;&gt;employee satisfaction around the developed world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades this has been a known problem, usually resulting in companies having after-hours meetings to try and figure out how to reduce after-hours meetings, or just shrugging and declaring that &lt;a href=&quot;https://soranews24.com/2017/04/27/w-t-f-japan-top-5-shikata-ga-nai-it-cant-be-helped-situations-in-japan%E3%80%90weird-top-five%E3%80%91/&quot;&gt;“it can’t be helped.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some businesses are finally taking &lt;strong&gt;actual steps to address the problem&lt;/strong&gt;. And one of them is probably the last company that many would expect: &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Japan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▼ A company that big might not seem like it would need to change anything, since people will always want to work there, so hearing they’re trying changes is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, Microsoft Japan carried out a “Working Reform Project” called the &lt;strong&gt;Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019&lt;/strong&gt;. For one month last August, the company implemented a three-day weekend every week, giving 2,300 employees every Friday off during the month. This “special paid vacation” did not come at the expense of any other vacation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the results were pretty incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the reductions. Employees took 25.4 percent fewer days off during the month, printed 58.7 percent fewer pages, and used 23.1 percent less electricity in the office (since it was closed an extra day). All of these saved the company quite a bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the increases. Productivity went up by a staggering 39.9 percent. That means &lt;strong&gt;even though the employees were at work for less time, more work was actually getting done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▼ A chart showing the changes. The tweet reads: &lt;em&gt;“It’s been proven! Let’s implement the three-day weekend everywhere right now!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot; readability=&quot;8.1123595505618&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;10.247191011236&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;ja&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;ja&quot; xml:lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;証明されたぞ！！！！！！&lt;br /&gt;今から日本全体で週休3日にしよう！！！！！！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;週休3日制でも生産性4割向上、日本マイクロソフトが新施策の成果発表 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/678KX94ZDk&quot;&gt;https://t.co/678KX94ZDk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— shogo.yamada (@yshogo87) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yshogo87/status/1190074262754754560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the increase in productivity is attributed to the changing of meetings. With only four days to get everything done for the week, many meetings were cut, shortened, or changed to virtual meetings instead of in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even though it should seem obvious, it’s also important to note that &lt;strong&gt;92.1 percent of employees said that they liked the four day workweek&lt;/strong&gt; at the end of the trial. Due to its success this year, Microsoft is planning on repeating it again next summer or perhaps at other times as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how &lt;strong&gt;Japanese netizens&lt;/strong&gt; reacted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Here’s to hoping my boss reads about this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So I guess me feeling like I’m ready to be done for the week by Wednesday is pretty natural.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Unfortunately, us Japanese people value ignoring efficiency and wasting time at work over actually being productive.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I mean, the people working at Microsoft are first-class employees. I bet they could get everything done in three days.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’d love for this to be implemented more, but I feel like making it work at companies open all week could be difficult. They’d have to hire more workers to rotate through the days.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yeah, Microsoft is different from regular businesses, so I don’t think this would work everywhere.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of the commentors have a point that this kind of policy wouldn’t work for every type of job, one thing is for certain: humans are only capable of doing so much work in a week. Beyond a certain threshold, no matter the job, work isn’t going to be work anymore, it’s just going to be time-padding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And considering that &lt;a href=&quot;https://soranews24.com/2018/07/09/tokyo-companies-late-night-overtime-habits-exposed-in-time-lapse-youtube-video-channel%E3%80%90videos%E3%80%91/&quot;&gt;Japan’s overwork culture can be physically seen from the city streets&lt;/a&gt;, taking a chance on something like this and seeing how it goes seems like a far better idea than just sticking with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Money Farmers: How Oligarchs and Populists Milk the E.U.</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/europe/eu-farm-subsidy-hungary.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;CSAKVAR, Hungary — Under Communism, farmers labored in the fields that stretch for miles around this town west of Budapest, reaping wheat and corn for a government that had stolen their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today, their children toil for new overlords, a group of oligarchs and political patrons who have annexed the land through opaque deals with the Hungarian government. They have created a modern twist on a feudal system, giving jobs and aid to the compliant, and punishing the mutinous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These land barons, as it turns out, are financed and emboldened by the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every year, the 28-country bloc pays out $65 billion in farm subsidies intended to support farmers around the Continent and keep rural communities alive. But across Hungary and much of Central and Eastern Europe, the bulk goes to a connected and powerful few. The prime minister of the Czech Republic collected tens of millions of dollars in subsidies just last year. Subsidies have underwritten Mafia-style land grabs in Slovakia and Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Europe’s farm program, a system that was instrumental in forming the European Union, is now being exploited by the same antidemocratic forces that threaten the bloc from within. This is because governments in Central and Eastern Europe, several led by populists, have wide latitude in how the subsidies, funded by taxpayers across Europe, are distributed — even as the entire system is shrouded in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A New York Times investigation, conducted in nine countries for much of 2019, uncovered a subsidy system that is deliberately opaque, grossly undermines the European Union’s environmental goals and is warped by corruption and self-dealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Europe’s machinery in Brussels enables this rough-hewed corruption because confronting it would mean changing a program that helps hold a precarious union together. European leaders disagree about many things, but they all count on generous subsidies and wide discretion in spending them. Bucking that system to rein in abuses in newer member states would disrupt political and economic fortunes across the Continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is why, with the farm bill up for renewal this year, the focus in Brussels isn’t on rooting out corruption or tightening controls. Instead, lawmakers are moving to give national leaders more authority on how they spend money — over &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/OP18_07/OP18_07_EN.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the objections of internal auditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The program is the biggest item in the European Union’s central budget, accounting for 40 percent of expenditures. It’s one of the largest subsidy programs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet some lawmakers in Brussels who write and vote on farm policy admit they often have no idea where the money goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One place it goes is here in Fejer County, home to Hungary’s populist prime minister, Viktor Orban. An icon to Europe’s far right and a harsh critic of Brussels and European elites, Mr. Orban is happy to accept European Union money. The Times investigation found that he uses European subsidies as a patronage system that enriches his friends and family, protects his political interests and punishes his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Those who control the land, in turn, qualify for millions in subsidies from the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s an absolutely corrupt system,” said Jozsef Angyan, who once served as Mr. Orban’s under secretary for rural development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The brazen patronage in Fejer County was not supposed to happen. Since the earliest days of the European Union, farm policy has had outsized importance as an immutable system of public welfare. In the United States, Social Security or Medicare are perhaps the closest equivalents, but neither of them is a sacrosanct provision written into the nation’s founding documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The European Union spends three times as much as the United States on farm subsidies each year, but as the system has expanded, accountability has not kept up. National governments &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-funding/beneficiaries/shared_en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publish some information on recipients&lt;/a&gt;, but the largest beneficiaries hide behind complex ownership structures. And although farmers are paid, in part, based on their acreage, property data is kept secret, making it harder to track land grabs and corruption. The European Union maintains a master database but, citing the difficulty of downloading the requested information, refused to provide The Times a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In response, the Times compiled its own database that, while incomplete, supplemented publicly available information on subsidy payments. This included corporate and government records; data on land sales and leases; and leaked documents and nonpublic land records received from whistle-blowers and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Times confirmed land deals that benefited a select group of political insiders, visited farms in several countries, and used government records to determine subsidy payments received by some of the largest of these beneficiaries. The Times investigation also built on the work done by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://atlatszo.hu/2017/07/05/terkepekre-es-abrakra-tettuk-a-foldarveresek-eredmenyeit/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hungarian journalists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://k.blog.hu/2019/08/12/agrar_767&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.direkt36.hu/en/meszaros-lorinc-kore-elkezdte-atvenni-az-egykori-simicska-birodalmat/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have investigated&lt;/a&gt; land &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://english.atlatszo.hu/2018/07/01/fidesz-strongmans-family-buys-huge-plots-of-state-land-for-a-bargain-price/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abuses&lt;/a&gt; despite a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/hungary-newspaper-nepszabadsag.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;media crackdown&lt;/a&gt; by Mr. Orban’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How oligarchs, Mafia figures and populists get rich off the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-takeaways&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farm subsidies helped form the basis for the modern European Union. Today, they help underwrite a sort of modern feudalism in which small farmers are beholden to politically connected land barons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The European Union provides $65 billion to farmers each year. It’s the largest line item in the E.U. budget and one of the biggest subsidy programs in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The centerpiece of the program is that people get paid based on how much land they farm. The system is supposed to help hard-working farmers and stabilize Europe’s food supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But in former Soviet bloc countries, where the government owned lots of farmland, leaders like Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, have auctioned off land to political allies and family members. And the subsidies follow the land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company formed by the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, collected at least $42 million in subsidies last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the Czech Republic, the highest-profile subsidy recipient is Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist who is also the prime minister. The Times analysis found his companies in the Czech Republic collected at least $42 million in agricultural subsidies last year. Mr. Babis, who denied any wrongdoing, is the subject of two &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-66584650-hn-exkluzivne-druhy-audit-ek-k-babisove-stretu-zajmu-je-stejne-zdrcujici-cesko-muze-prijit-o-miliardy&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conflict-of-interest audits this year&lt;/a&gt;. The Czech government has, in recent years, ushered in rules that make it easier for big companies — his is the biggest — to receive more subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The European Union is paying so much money to an oligarch who’s also a politician,” said Lukas Wagenknecht, a Czech senator and economist who used to work for Mr. Babis. “And what’s the result? You have the most powerful politician in the Czech Republic, and he’s completely supported by the European Union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Bulgaria, the subsidies have become welfare for the farming elite. The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.iki.bas.bg/files/Doklad_2016_EN.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bulgarian Academy of Science has found&lt;/a&gt; that 75 percent of the main type of European agricultural subsidy in the country ends up in the hands of about 100 entities. This spring, the authorities carried out raids across the country that exposed corrupt ties between government officials and agricultural businessmen. One of the largest flour producers in the country was charged with fraud in connection with the subsidies and is awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Slovakia, the top prosecutor has acknowledged the existence of an “agricultural Mafia.” Small farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for land that is valuable for the subsidies it receives. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/europe/jan-kuciak-slovakia-journalist-killed.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;A journalist, Jan Kuciak, was murdered&lt;/a&gt; last year &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/europe/slovakia-journalist-murder.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;while investigating Italian mobsters&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the farm industry, profited from subsidies and built relationships with powerful politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Despite this, proposed reforms are often watered down or brushed aside in Brussels and many other European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;European Union officials dismissed &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/540369/IPOL_STU(2015)540369_EN.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2015 report&lt;/a&gt; that recommended tightening farm-subsidy rules as a safeguard against Central and Eastern European land grabbing. The European Parliament rejected a bill that would have banned politicians from benefiting from the subsidies they administer. And top officials swat away suggestions of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have an almost watertight system,” Rudolf Mögele, one of Europe’s top agricultural officials, said in an interview earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Unstated is that, while audits can catch incidents of outright fraud, rooting out self-dealing and legalized corruption is far more difficult. The European Union seldom interferes with national affairs, giving deference to elected leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Few leaders have attempted such widespread, brazen exploitation of the subsidy system as Mr. Orban in Hungary. At rallies, he deploys a false narrative that Brussels wants to strip away farm aid and use it to bring in migrants, and that he alone can stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Farmers who criticize the government or the patronage system say they have been denied grants or faced surprise audits and unusual environmental inspections, in what amounts to a sophisticated intimidation campaign that harkens to the Communist era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s not like when a car comes for you at night and takes you away,” said Istvan Teichel, who farms a small plot in Mr. Orban’s home county. “This is deeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One man who did speak up was Mr. Angyan, the former under secretary for rural development. A jowly, gray-haired rural economist with a mischievous smile, Mr. Angyan became an unlikely crusader for small farmers. He served under Mr. Orban, initially thinking him a reformer, only to leave angry and disillusioned. He canvassed the countryside, documenting the government’s dubious land deals and mistreatment of small farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And then he disappeared from public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-63ac5a58&quot;&gt;A Thief Economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To understand how leaders like Viktor Orban exploit Europe’s largest subsidy program requires going back 15 years, to when Hungary was spinning with optimism and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a moment that symbolized Western triumph in the Cold War, the European Union officially absorbed much of the breadbasket of Central and Eastern Europe on May 1, 2004. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia — all former Soviet satellites — were among 10 nations that joined the bloc that day (Romania and Bulgaria joined three years later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amid the celebrations, Mr. Orban was in political purgatory. He had been the prime minister who helped guide Hungary into the union — only to see voters turn him and his party, Fidesz, out of office in 2002. Now he noticed one of the first protest groups to emerge in the new Hungary: farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hungarian farmers clogged Budapest’s narrow streets in 2005 for a mass demonstration. They did not oppose European Union membership. Far from it. As new European citizens, they wanted the subsidies they were eligible for under the bloc’s Common Agricultural Policy, or C.A.P., but the payments hadn’t arrived. Hungary’s left-leaning government was too disorganized and unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;From the outset, the European subsidies represented a pot of money scarcely fathomable to farmers accustomed to Communist austerity. The program was designed after the Second World War to boost farming salaries and ramp up food production in countries laid waste by conflict. Over time, it became a critical foundation in creating the borderless economy that would grow into the modern European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;European leaders understood that absorbing former Soviet satellites would bring challenges, but never fully grasped the potential for corruption in the subsidy program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At its heart, the program is defined by a simple proposition: Farmers are mostly paid based on how many acres they harvest. Whoever controls the most land gets the most money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And Central and Eastern Europe had lots of land, much of it still state-owned, a legacy of the Communist era. European officials worked closely with incoming governments on issues such as meeting food testing standards, or controlling borders, yet only limited attention was paid to the subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They thought they would change us,” said Jana Polakova, a Czech agricultural scientist. “They were not prepared for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Orban showed hints of what was to come even before Hungary joined the bloc. Before he left office in 2002, Mr. Orban sold 12 state-owned farming companies, which became known as the “Dirty Dozen,” to a group of politically connected buyers. Buyers got cut-rate deals and exclusive rights to the land for 50 years, making them eligible for subsidies when Hungary became part of the system two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is a crony economy, where friends and political allies get special treatment,” said Gyorgy Rasko, a former Hungarian agriculture minister. “Orban didn’t invent the system. He’s just running it more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Out of office, Mr. Orban watched the farmers’ protests in Budapest and saw the potential political and economic power of subsidies in the countryside. He also was intrigued by the man who negotiated successfully on behalf of the protesters: Jozsef Angyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the fall of Communism, Mr. Angyan made the case that small landholders could keep villages alive through sustainable practices. He founded an environmental program at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities and helped build an organic farm called Kishantos with 1,100 acres of wheat, corn and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“He wanted to help the local farmers,” said Mr. Teichel, the farmer from Fejer County, who said Mr. Angyan was a rare champion of the small farmer in a countryside where corrupt politicians ran a “thief economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eight years after losing office, Mr. Orban again ran for prime minister in 2010 and wanted to court the rural vote. Mr. Angyan was now a member of Parliament, and his ties to the farmers gave him political clout in the countryside. Mr. Orban summoned him to his modest home west of Budapest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was a chilly February morning and Mr. Angyan had a cold. So Mr. Orban fixed tea over a wood-burning stove and, for two hours, the two men spoke about the future of Hungarian farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Angyan envisioned a government that gave small farmers more political and economic clout. Mr. Orban made it clear that he wanted to implement Mr. Angyan’s ideas and offered to make him under secretary of rural development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“When Orban speaks, he speaks with such conviction,” Mr. Angyan said. “You believe him. I believed him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After a landslide victory, Mr. Orban moved quickly, just not as Mr. Angyan had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Angyan’s proposal called on the government to carve up its massive plots and lease them to small and midsize farmers. But Mr. Orban instead wanted to lease whole swaths of land to a coterie of his allies, a move that Mr. Angyan predicted would make the countryside beholden to Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz, and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He also knew that European subsidies would follow the land, widening the gap between rich and poor and making it easier for those at the top to wield power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I had absolutely no chance to carry out what I wanted to do,” Mr. Angyan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2011, Mr. Orban’s new government began leasing out public land. At first, officials said that only local, small-scale farmers would be eligible for leases. But the plots ultimately went to politically connected individuals who, in some cases, had been the sole bidders present at auctions. By 2015, hundreds of thousands of acres of public land were leased out and much of it went to people close to Fidesz, according to records obtained from the government and Mr. Angyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New leaseholders paid low rates to the government, even as they became eligible for European subsidies. The deals drew sharp criticism in the local media, yet ordinary farmers stayed quiet, despite being left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In one example, a powerful Fidesz lawmaker, Roland Mengyi, inserted himself into the leasing process in Borsod-Abauj Zemplen County, where one of his associates won leases for more than 1,200 acres. Mr. Mengyi is an outsized character, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://168ora.hu/itthon/a-fideszes-voldemort-nagyur-es-a-penzfalok-igy-lopnak-unios-milliardokat-15727&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who referred to himself as “&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://168ora.hu/itthon/a-fideszes-voldemort-nagyur-es-a-penzfalok-igy-lopnak-unios-milliardokat-15727&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lord Voldemort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://168ora.hu/itthon/a-fideszes-voldemort-nagyur-es-a-penzfalok-igy-lopnak-unios-milliardokat-15727&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;.”&lt;/a&gt; He was later convicted and sentenced to prison in a separate case for corruption related to European subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Orban’s sudden change in policy left Mr. Angyan disillusioned, and feeling betrayed. He quit the government in 2012 but remained in Parliament, where he tried to push his vision, even as the government moved in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At a closed-door meeting in early 2013, Mr. Angyan confronted Mr. Orban in front of the prime minister’s most trusted allies in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You’re going to destroy the countryside!” Mr. Angyan recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You are a well-poisoner,” Mr. Orban shot back, according to Mr. Angyan, startling the crowd with a blunt rebuke of a former member of his cabinet. “You have abandoned me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As a shocked silence fell over the party faithful, Mr. Orban launched into a soliloquy comparing politics to a battlefield. Those who are loyal, he said, could count on their brothers in arms for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“But those who aren’t?” the prime minister asked. “We will also fire at them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-683c1e95&quot;&gt;A Modern Feudalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2015, Mr. Orban started moving even faster. His government sold hundreds of thousands of acres of state farmland, much of it to politically connected allies. Technically, it was an auction. But many local farmers say they were told not to bother bidding because winners had been predetermined. Few could afford the large plots, anyway, and many more did not even know about the sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One pensioner, Ferenc Horvath, 63, lives in a shack in Fejer County, and belatedly discovered that the government had sold all the state-owned land surrounding his tiny plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It happened so fast,” Mr. Horvath said. “We had no idea you could buy land here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On nearly all sides, Mr. Horvath had a new neighbor, Lorinc Meszaros, a childhood friend of Mr. Orban and former pipe-fitter who is now a billionaire. Fences sprung up overnight, and the stench of pig manure fell over the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Meszaros, along with his relatives, has bought more than 3,800 acres in Fejer County alone, according to a Times analysis of land data compiled by Mr. Angyan and other sources, and confirmed by visits to the farm. Mr. Orban’s son-in-law and another friend of the prime minister’s have also bought large estates a short drive away, The Times found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The prediction made by Mr. Angyan — that Mr. Orban’s policies would make the countryside beholden to Fidesz and his allies — was being realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is a type of modern feudalism, where small farmers live in the shadows of huge, politically powerful interests — and European Union subsidies help finance it. In recent years, according to a Times analysis of Hungarian payment data, the largest private recipients of farm subsidies were companies controlled by Mr. Meszaros and Sandor Csanyi, an influential businessman in Budapest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last year alone, companies controlled by the two men received a total of $28 million in subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The two men have radically different relationships with Mr. Orban and his party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Csanyi is seen as someone Mr. Orban cannot afford to antagonize. He is chairman of OTP Bank, one of the nation’s most important financial institutions, and has a reputation for outlasting mercurial leaders. He has hired out-of-work politicians from all parties, and his farming conglomerate, led by his son, now controls two of the “Dirty Dozen” companies privatized by Mr. Orban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Meszaros’s fortune, by contrast, is tightly bound to the prime minister. He has built an empire by winning government contracts for projects largely financed by the European Union and has recently snapped up companies that once belonged to a business tycoon who had fallen out of favor with Mr. Orban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They are eligible for a range of subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, whether direct payments based on acreage, subsidies directed at livestock and dairy farming or rural development programs — all of which is distributed at the national level by the Fidesz government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m always accused, and I am very angry about it, that I got the biggest subsidies,” Mr. Csanyi said in an interview. The reason, he said, is not politics. It is pigs. “I produce about one-sixth of the Hungarian pig production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On paper, landowners should face restrictions. The Hungarian government has capped subsidy payments to the biggest farms, a seemingly progressive policy advocated by reformers. But farmers say it is easy to skirt the rule by dividing plots and registering the land to different owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Rajmund Fekete, a spokesman for Mr. Orban, said that Hungarian subsidy procedures “fully satisfy” European regulations but declined to answer specific questions about Mr. Angyan, or about land sales that benefited Mr. Orban’s relatives and allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Hungary is also fully compliant in the sale of state land, which is regulated by law,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Brussels, European officials were specifically warned about problems in Hungary even before the auctions. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/540369/IPOL_STU(2015)540369_EN.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A May 2015 report&lt;/a&gt;, commissioned by the European Parliament, investigated land grabbing and cited “dubious land deals” in Hungary. The report even cited Mr. Orban’s home of Fejer County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More broadly, the investigators found that wealthy, politically connected landowners had the power to annex land across Central and Eastern Europe. “This is particularly so when they conspire with government authorities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Bulgaria, for example, land brokers had pushed for laws allowing them to effectively annex small farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investigators pointed to the farm subsidy program as a major factor, saying it encouraged companies to acquire more and more land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The C.A.P. in this sense has clearly failed to live up to its declared objectives,” said the report, which was prepared by the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a written response, European agricultural officials denounced the findings as unreliable, and in bold letters declared that it was up to the countries’ leaders to set and enforce national land use policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That deference to national governments is a hallmark of the European Union. But it has left the bloc unable or unwilling to confront leaders who try to undermine its efforts, said Tomás García Azcárate, a longtime European agriculture official who now trains the Continent’s policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The European Union has very limited instruments for dealing with gangster member states,” he said. “It’s true on policy, on agriculture, on immigration. It’s a real problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-a7yk8a e73j0it0&quot;&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Orban and Mr. Meszaros, center-left, at the opening ceremony of a soccer stadium in 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Akos Stiller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Sandor Csanyi, an influential businessman in Budapest, is seen as someone Mr. Orban cannot afford to antagonize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Akos Stiller/Bloomberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As Mr. Orban’s government began auctioning off thousands of acres to his allies, Mr. Angyan began his own project. Out of government, he meticulously studied the land sales, compiling a record that officials could not easily purge. He interviewed farmers who had been abandoned by the government and mapped political connections among the buyers — findings now supported by the Times analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Beyond the biggest oligarchs like Mr. Meszaros, other supporters and sympathizers of Mr. Orban got blocks of public land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Csongrad County, for example, family members and associates of Janos Lazar, a Fidesz lawmaker, were among the biggest buyers, obtaining about 1,300 acres. In Bacs-Kiskun County, associates and family members of a former business partner of Mr. Meszaros bought big chunks of land. And in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok County, associates and relatives of current and former Orban government officials were among the biggest winners in the land auctions. Many have since leased the plots, with a markup, to big agricultural firms that receive European subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is what the European Union resources do, and the revenues from the land do,” said Mihaly Borbiro, a former mayor of Obarok, a tiny village in Fejer County, a short drive from Mr. Orban’s hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While political patrons get rich, many small farmers count on the subsidies to survive. That discourages them from criticizing the system too loudly, many of the farmers said, especially in the face of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ferenc Gal, who raises cows, alfalfa and a few pigs on his family farm, said he applied to lease about 320 acres because the European subsidies alone would have made it profitable before he even planted anything. Local farmers were supposed to get preference, but the land went to wealthy out-of-town investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When he complained, he quickly found himself a pariah. He said government inspectors showed up at his farm, suddenly concerned about environmental and water quality. He said local officials told him not to bother applying for future rural grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Once you’re on a black list,” Mr. Gal said, “that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1320w4z eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-43f358c7&quot;&gt;A Policy of Fear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Retribution also found Jozsef Angyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Months after he quit the cabinet, government officials retracted the lease on Kishantos, the organic farm he had helped operate for 20 years. They gave the land to political loyalists, who plowed over the fields and sprayed the cropland with chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then school officials shuttered Mr. Angyan’s department at Szent Istvan University, destroying his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Orban understands when to keep people in fear,” Mr. Angyan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In interviews in Hungary, some agricultural scientists and economists refused to discuss land ownership or asked to not be identified when discussing their research. Farmers, too, saw what happened to the man who spoke up for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If Angyan can’t do anything, what can I do?” said Mr. Teichel, the family farmer near Mr. Orban’s hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Orban’s control of the European subsidies helps prevent another rural uprising, Mr. Angyan said. As long as the government administers the grants, nobody can afford to speak up. “If you’re critical of the system,” he said, “you get nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Besides, he added, there is no real opposition in the countryside. Mr. Angyan’s small farmers’ association forged an alliance with Mr. Orban’s far-right party to get the prime minister re-elected. That relationship has outlasted Mr. Angyan, and those in charge of the farming group now hold powerful government positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Angyan has receded from public life. This year, he met twice with The Times, providing the data he had been compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the second meeting, Mr. Angyan stopped returning phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Mr. Teichel saw him recently at a funeral, he looked defeated. “He’s given up the fight,” Mr. Teichel said. As usual, Mr. Angyan asked how the farmer and his family were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I don’t matter,” Mr. Teichel replied. “I’m just a soldier. How are you doing? You are the general.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Angyan replied: “How should I continue when nobody is behind me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;Reporting was contributed by Agustin Armendariz in London, Hana de Goeij in Prague, Milan Schreuer in Brussels, Akos Stiller in Budapest and Boryana Dzhambazova in Sofia, Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Alcohol breath tests are often unreliable</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A million Americans a year are arrested for drunken driving, and most stops begin the same way: flashing blue lights in the rearview mirror, then a battery of tests that might include standing on one foot or reciting the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What matters most, though, happens next. By the side of the road or at the police station, the drivers blow into a miniature science lab that estimates the concentration of alcohol in their blood. If the level is 0.08 or higher, they are all but certain to be convicted of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But those tests — a bedrock of the criminal justice system — are often unreliable, a New York Times investigation found. The devices, found in virtually every police station in America, generate skewed results with alarming frequency, even though they are marketed as precise to the third decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Judges in Massachusetts and New Jersey have thrown out more than 30,000 breath tests in the past 12 months alone, largely because of human errors and lax governmental oversight. Across the country, thousands of other tests also have been invalidated in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The machines are sensitive scientific instruments, and in many cases they haven’t been properly calibrated, yielding results that were at times 40 percent too high. Maintaining machines is up to police departments that sometimes have shoddy standards and lack expertise. In some cities, lab officials have used stale or home-brewed chemical solutions that warped results. In Massachusetts, officers used &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/5095-rat-machine-photos-and-foia/493a6ea0dab1497bad00/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a machine with rats nesting inside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;There are more than a million drunken driving arrests in America each year, but the devices the police use to test drivers’ breath may not even work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;css-16zlh5b e1mu4ftr0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Technical experts have found serious programming mistakes in the machines’ software. States have picked devices that their own experts didn’t trust and have disabled safeguards meant to ensure the tests’ accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Times interviewed more than 100 lawyers, scientists, executives and police officers and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of court records, corporate filings, confidential emails and contracts. Together, they reveal the depth of a nationwide problem that has attracted only sporadic attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A county judge in Pennsylvania &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1933-schidlt-decision-pa/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called it “extremely questionable”&lt;/a&gt; whether any of his state’s breath tests could withstand serious scrutiny. In response, local prosecutors stopped using them. In Florida, a panel of judges described their state’s instrument as a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1935-orange-county-decision-2014-breath-tests/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“magic black box”&lt;/a&gt; with “significant and continued anomalies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even some industry veterans say the machines should not be de facto arbiters of guilt. “The tests were never meant to be used that way,” said John Fusco, who ran National Patent Analytical Systems, a maker of breath-testing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet the tests have become all but unavoidable. Every state punishes drivers who refuse to take one when ordered by a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The consequences of the legal system’s reliance on these tests are far-reaching. People are wrongfully convicted based on dubious evidence. Hundreds were never notified that their cases were built on faulty tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And when flaws are discovered, the solution has been to discard the results — letting potentially dangerous drivers off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A man backed his car into an 83-year-old woman outside a liquor store and then failed field sobriety tests. Another man was stopped after vomiting out the window and veering “all over the road.” One more driver, with a suspended license, was pulled over and blew a 0.32 — a level of drunkenness that would leave most people unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;All three were arrested and charged with driving drunk. All three had previous convictions for driving while intoxicated, according to police reports and court records. And all three were acquitted after Massachusetts was forced to throw out their breath tests — along with more than 36,000 others — in one of the largest exclusions of forensic evidence in American history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Deerfield River snakes through the woods of northwestern Massachusetts, and on a hot Sunday in July 2013 it was packed with rafters. Matthew Mottor arrived with more than a dozen friends and family members and two coolers of Blue Moon beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They spent hours tubing down the river and drinking before going ashore for a picnic. That’s when a drunk woman in the group caught the eye of a Massachusetts State Police trooper patrolling the area. The trooper, Steven Hean, told them to get their friend home. The party over, Mr. Mottor left his girlfriend and got a ride to his truck, a few miles upriver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He pulled his gray Dodge Durango onto the winding road. He made it about 200 yards. Then he saw the flashing lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Trooper Hean wrote in a report that he stopped Mr. Mottor for driving 41 miles per hour in a 25 m.p.h. zone. Detecting “a strong odor” of liquor on Mr. Mottor’s breath, the trooper asked him to perform some field sobriety tests, including walking heel-to-toe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Accidents years earlier had left Mr. Mottor with metal plates in his ankles and feet, court records show. “I explained to him that I’m not great at walking around on two feet on an everyday basis,” Mr. Mottor said. After passing two tests — reciting the alphabet and standing on one leg — he struggled to walk in a line. Trooper Hean brought out his breath tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hand-held devices, like Trooper Hean’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.intox.com/product/alco-sensor-iv/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alco-Sensor IV&lt;/a&gt;, contain fuel cells that react to the alcohol in exhaled breaths and generate an electric current — the stronger the current, the higher the alcohol level. They are inexpensive and easy to maintain, but their results can be inconsistent. Older women sometimes &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10926340&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have trouble producing enough breath&lt;/a&gt; to get the machines to work. Toothpaste, mouthwash and breath mints — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406081&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even hand sanitizer&lt;/a&gt; and burping — may throw off the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tests from those portable machines are not admissible in court in most states (California is among the exceptions). But they often trigger an arrest, which leads to a test on another machine at the police station. That result determines whether someone is charged — and, often, whether they’re convicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the side of River Road, Mr. Mottor blew a 0.13, far above the legal limit. That’s when the cuffs came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Attempts to prevent drunken driving predate the modern automobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the late 19th century, Britain had outlawed being drunk while operating a “carriage, horse, cattle or steam engine.” In 1897, a London taxi driver named George Smith crashed his electric cab. He confessed to having had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/5091-george-smith-arrest/aa5428485aae96bf930c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“two or three glasses of beer”&lt;/a&gt; and was fined 20 shillings. It is widely regarded as the first arrest for intoxicated driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Near the end of Prohibition, a biochemist invented a suitcase-sized machine with vials of chemicals and a balloon to blow into. Alcohol in the driver’s breath would trigger a reaction: the drunker the driver, the deeper the chemicals’ color. It was called the Drunkometer. But it was bulky and hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Two decades later, a police photographer and amateur chemist named Robert Borkenstein developed a similar but more portable machine. He named it the Breathalyzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/11/29/92767589.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Police departments around the country&lt;/a&gt; bought Mr. Borkenstein’s invention and versions developed by competitors. Then, in 1980, a fatal collision led to an overhaul of America’s drunken driving laws — and a sales boom for companies that made breath-testing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Carime Lightner, 13, was walking to a church carnival in Fair Oaks, Calif., when a drunken driver slammed into her so hard she was knocked out of her shoes. The man had been arrested repeatedly for intoxicated driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Carime’s mother &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://people.com/archive/a-grieving-angry-mother-charges-that-drunken-drivers-are-getting-away-with-murder-vol-15-no-25/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;started Mothers Against Drunk Driving&lt;/a&gt; and launched one of the most effective citizen lobbying campaigns in history. States set stiffer penalties, including mandatory jail time in some cases, and made it illegal to drive with a blood-alcohol level above a designated mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The crackdown worked. In 1982, the year the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began keeping records, some 21,000 people were killed in drunken-driving incidents. The number of deaths &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tumbled to around 10,500&lt;/a&gt; in the most recent annual tally, even as the number of miles driven by Americans has nearly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr&quot;&gt;From the First Drunken Driving Case to Modern Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;Read the documents The Times gathered to understand breath-testing machines, and the problems that have caused tens of thousands of tests to be thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In most of the country, the threshold for illegal drunkenness is 0.08 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. The only way to measure that directly is to draw blood, which &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/politics/warrants-required-to-test-blood-but-not-breath-supreme-court-rules.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;requires a warrant&lt;/a&gt;. Breath tests are simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Testing machines can go for $10,000 or more, and some two dozen companies sell them in the United States. The biggest contracts, with state police crime labs, are worth millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A St. Louis company, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.intox.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intoximeters&lt;/a&gt;, made the portable device used on Mr. Mottor. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Home&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dräger&lt;/a&gt;, a German company, owns the rights to the Breathalyzer name. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.alcoholtest.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CMI&lt;/a&gt;, based in Kentucky, is another industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Our top priority is the quality and safety of our products,” said Brian Shaffer, a Dräger spokesman. “Our products provide the highest level of forensic and legal integrity.” He added, “Our advanced evidential breath alcohol testing instruments exceed the requirements of national and international regulatory agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;CMI and Intoximeters did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-c166d69&quot;&gt;STARTING TO PANIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Shirtless and still in swim trunks, Mr. Mottor arrived at the police barracks in Cheshire, Mass. He didn’t think he was drunk. But he was starting to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He had left his phone in his S.U.V. and had no way to tell his girlfriend what had happened. He pictured her alone by the river, thinking he had driven into a ditch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Mottor was escorted to the station’s breath-testing machine. It was larger, more sophisticated and in theory more reliable than Trooper Hean’s portable instrument, and its results were admissible in court. Trooper Hean asked Mr. Mottor to start blowing. Hoping it would help him get back to his girlfriend faster, he complied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Alcotest 9510, manufactured by Dräger, resembles a fax machine with a small hose. As a person breathes into the device, a beam of infrared light is shot through the sample. Chemicals, including the ethanol in alcoholic drinks, absorb light to varying degrees. By analyzing how much light is absorbed, the instrument can identify the type of chemical and the amount of it present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many machines, including the Alcotest 9510, also use a fuel-cell sensor — the same type of tool that is in portable devices. Each system is supposed to operate independently; if both return similar results, the theory goes, it’s an extra assurance that the measurement is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Mottor blew for about 10 seconds, the machine beeped, and a number flashed on its screen: 0.08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was charged with operating under the influence, which leads to the automatic revocation of driving privileges in Massachusetts. Trooper Hean confiscated Mr. Mottor’s license and called a truck to tow his S.U.V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3fdb6dea&quot;&gt;SECRET SOFTWARE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Breath-testing machines need less than a minute to run their calculations. What happens during those 60 seconds, though, has been the subject of years of courtroom fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Defense lawyers have repeatedly tried to forensically examine the machines, especially their software. Inspecting the code could reveal any built-in flaws or assumptions the devices use in their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But even procuring a machine is a challenge. Manufacturers won’t sell them to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jan Semenoff, a former police officer who works with defense lawyers, was once a CMI salesman and had a machine left over from those days. When he sent it in for a repair, CMI wiped the machine’s memory chip. “They turned the damn thing into a paperweight,” Mr. Semenoff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Courts in at least six states, including New York, have rebuffed defense lawyers’ attempts to get their hands on the machines’ code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But in 2007, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted a request by defense lawyers and ordered Dräger to allow outside experts to analyze the software for the Alcotest 7110 machines in use statewide. The experts said it was littered with “thousands of programming errors,” according to their report to the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After reviewing the evidence, the court &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1989907/state-v-chun/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deemed the Alcotest 7110 “generally scientifically reliable.”&lt;/a&gt; But the state court also acknowledged the devices had “mechanical and technical shortcomings” that had the potential to produce the wrong result. Dräger said it quickly fixed the problems, but the state never rolled out the software update, court records show. Dräger &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Applications/Products/Alcohol-and-Drug-Testing/Evidential-Breath-Tester/Alcotest-7110-Evidential&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;now advertises the 7110&lt;/a&gt; as the only device on the market whose software “has been reviewed by independent third parties and approved by a Supreme Court decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;None of that made a difference in other states, which employ a variety of machines and standards. Each state decides how rigorously it will test machines, and several have used devices that were deemed unreliable elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2005, for example, Vermont’s toxicology lab scrutinized machines from four manufacturers. The lab rated CMI’s Intoxilyzer 8000 as “unsatisfactory” and found that it gave inaccurate results on “almost every test,” according to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1927-breath-alcohol-tester-evaluations-vermont-2005/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lab technician’s report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the same device was already being used in Mississippi, and it would soon be deployed by other states, including Ohio and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Florida, too, adopted the Intoxilyzer 8000, even after a test machine short-circuited and started to smoke, state records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the state began setting up its new devices, technicians found they were returning inaccurately low results, according to court testimony. A CMI engineer diagnosed a problem with airflow, and he drilled a small hole in the exhaust valve to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The fix worked. CMI started boring holes in all the devices it sent to police departments in Florida, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When defense lawyers discovered the undisclosed change, they challenged its legality. The Collier County judge who heard the case in 2012 said he was “extremely concerned” about the modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“A criminal defendant should not face conviction and possible incarceration based on secret undisclosed evidence,” &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1919-florida-carr-2012-ruling/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1919-florida-carr-2012-ruling/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in his ruling&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/crime/os-dui-test-machine-ruling-orange-county-20140926-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that case&lt;/a&gt; and others led several Florida judges to stop allowing breath tests to be used in their courtrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Defense lawyers in state courts across the country have sought to learn more about the devices being used to convict their clients. In two states, Washington and Massachusetts, they took aim at the instrument that Mr. Mottor blew into: Dräger’s Alcotest 9510.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6916797b&quot;&gt;‘THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the State of Washington decided to spend more than $1 million to replace its aging machines in 2009, the state police chose the Alcotest 9510 despite &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1928-evaluation-december-2007-new-e/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; by their own scientist that described the machines as “not yet ready for implementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before rolling out the machines, state officials debated whether to spend tens of thousands of dollars on an outside expert to evaluate the software. Fiona Couper, a state toxicologist, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/5092--throw-caution-to-the-wind/aa5428485aae96bf930c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emailed her colleagues&lt;/a&gt;: “I think we throw caution to the wind and proceed without paying up front for an independent evaluation.” (In an email to The Times, Ms. Couper said that “it was too premature to evaluate the software at that time.” Court records show no evaluation was ever done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2015, a local judge granted a request from defense lawyers to review the software underpinning the state’s Alcotest machines. That task fell to a consulting company run by two veteran programmers and security experts, Robert Walker and Falcon Momot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwa/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. Walker&lt;/a&gt; had worked at Microsoft for more than a decade and was adept with Windows CE, the obsolete operating system powering the Alcotest 9510. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/falconk/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. Momot&lt;/a&gt;, a soft-spoken hacker with spiky facial piercings and a rainbow-colored mohawk, was known for his talent in hunting down complicated computer bugs and software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dräger insisted on extraordinary security. It demanded that its software be reviewed on an isolated computer network and that the state police be able to inspect the testers’ equipment, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I worked on the most confidential things that Microsoft does, and they don’t have any procedures like this,” Mr. Walker said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After a couple weeks dissecting the Alcotest code, they wrote a nine-page draft report, “Defective Design = Reasonable Doubt.” They planned to dig further, but things went awry when they shared their report with defense lawyers at a convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dräger sent Mr. Walker a letter demanding that he and Mr. Momot ask anyone with a copy of their report to destroy it — including the lawyers who hired them — and to stay silent about the instruments’ inner workings. Facing a giant company, Mr. Walker felt he had no choice but to comply. “I am an ant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Shaffer, the Dräger spokesman, said the company was defending its intellectual property. “We really have nothing to hide, but we have something to protect,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Although Mr. Momot and Mr. Walker’s preliminary report never made it into court, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/draeger-breathalyzer-breath-test-convictions/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a few copies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/draeger-breathalyzer-breath-test-convictions/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survived&lt;/a&gt;. The Times obtained one from a defense lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The report said the Alcotest 9510 was “not a sophisticated scientific measurement instrument” and “does not adhere to even basic standards of measurement.” It described a calculation error that Mr. Walker and Mr. Momot believed could round up some results. And it found that certain safeguards had been disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among them: Washington’s machines weren’t measuring drivers’ breath temperatures. Breath samples that are above 93.2 degrees — as most are — can trigger inaccurately high results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Washington had decided against spending more on a sensor that would check breath temperature and allow the software to adjust for it, according to Mr. Shaffer. He said Washington wasn’t alone; most of Dräger’s American clients skip the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Washington State Patrol is “very confident in the accuracy and reliability of the Dräger 9510 breath test instrument,” said Sergeant Darren Wright, a spokesman. He added that the patrol did not believe that the breath temperature sensor was needed to produce accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other states have disabled different safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Minnesota, for example, officials found that the fuel-cell systems in their DataMaster devices often broke down, according to court testimony. Instead of fixing the problem, technicians &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/new-dwi-tester-is-called-flawed/158324965/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;simply turned off that portion of the machine&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. The effect was to eliminate an important quality-control check — one that had been a selling point when the machines were purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which manages the testing program, said it “remains confident in the reliability of results obtained by DataMaster devices across Minnesota.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-18e7e270&quot;&gt;INSOMNIA AND SHAME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His license revoked, Mr. Mottor relied on rides from family and friends to get to the restaurant in the Berkshire Mountains where he was a chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The consequences rippled outward. He and his girlfriend shelved plans to buy a house. He couldn’t sleep. He could no longer drive his 2-year-old daughter to play dates. He worried about going to jail and leaving his family unable to afford to heat their single-wide trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think I took 10 years off my mother’s life,” Mr. Mottor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After three months, he was able to get his license reinstated while his case progressed. Mr. Mottor hired a lawyer to fight the charges. To pay that bill, he maxed out his credit cards, raided his retirement fund and borrowed money from nearly everyone he knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His lawyer planned his defense: Mr. Mottor had been entrapped by the state trooper, his foot injury explained why he failed the field sobriety test, and a phenomenon called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1507264&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“retrograde extrapolation”&lt;/a&gt; meant that Mr. Mottor’s blood-alcohol level might have been lower when he was on the road than when he was tested at the police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It didn’t occur to either of them to question the breath-testing device itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-46766ede&quot;&gt;DISREGARDING TRUTH AND ACCURACY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Questioning the device worked for Robert Friedlander — and set off a chain reaction that destabilized Colorado’s enforcement of drunken-driving laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On the night of May 30, 2016, a Colorado State Patrol officer pulled Mr. Friedlander over after seeing his Audi sedan swerving. At the station, he blew a 0.07 — below the threshold at which a driver is considered drunk, but high enough in Colorado for him to be charged with a lesser offense, impaired driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Friedlander, however, was adamant that he was not impaired — and that he had evidence to support his claim. Years earlier, he had been convicted of impaired driving, and he had carried around a small portable breath tester ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That May night, Mr. Friedlander had been drinking at the Ameristar casino in Black Hawk. He tested himself and blew a 0.05, he said. Then, he said, he waited an hour, without drinking, before he hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As Mr. Friedlander fought the charges, his case uncovered widespread problems with how the state forensic lab had deployed its fleet of more than 160 new Intoxilyzer 9000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before Colorado got those machines in 2013, a lab technician, Michael Barnhill, had tested devices from a number of manufacturers. He &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1921-barnhill-michael-sworn-statement/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; in Mr. Friedlander’s case that his manager ordered him to destroy records from those tests, as well as the manual for the Intoxilyzers, in case defense lawyers tried to subpoena the materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Colorado lab was rushing to meet its deadline to get the machines up and running. But breath-testing devices are not operational right out of the box. Each machine needs to be calibrated using samples with known alcohol concentrations. The process can take an hour or more per machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Barnhill said lab records were faked to show that he had calibrated dozens of instruments that he had never touched. And to speed things up, the lab’s supervisor summoned assistants, including an intern, a CMI lawyer and a sales manager, to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I had taken apart equipment before, but, you know, with my father and whatnot,” the intern, Adam Lopez, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1916-adam-lopez-deposition/aa5428485aae96bf930c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a deposition&lt;/a&gt;. “But never ever have I like done it on an instrument that is on a state level where it’s responsible for, you know, somebody’s prosecution.” He added: “There probably were some errors here and there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In addition, the lab’s former science director &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1922-affidavit-of-laura-gillim-ross/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a sworn affidavit&lt;/a&gt; that her digital signature had been used without her knowledge on documents certifying that the Intoxilyzers were reliable. The lab kept using her signature after she left for another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The judge overseeing Mr. Friedlander’s case was appalled. The lab decided to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1917-colorado-order-re-Intoxilyzer-9000/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“consciously disregard truth and accuracy,”&lt;/a&gt; he wrote. The judge ruled that Mr. Friedlander’s test was inadmissible unless the lab could prove its machine was producing sound results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At that point, the prosecutor offered Mr. Friedlander a chance to plead guilty to the lesser charge of reckless driving. He took the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Defense lawyers in Colorado seized on the ruling in Mr. Friedlander’s case to challenge breath test results in dozens of other cases. Most courts followed the judge’s lead and excluded the tests, but there was no statewide resolution, according to local lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Any problems have “long since been resolved,” said Scott Bookman, the laboratory director at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “I am fully committed to transparency and accuracy, and we will operate with those chief principles at the forefront of everything we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Friedlander, however, is skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I don’t condone drunken driving in the least little bit, but I was trying to follow the law,” he said. “The machines that they’re using really materially affect people, and these lab bureaucrats, running their little fiefdoms, didn’t seem to give a damn if they were accurate or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-722f6687&quot;&gt;HOME-BREWED CHEMICALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Colorado wasn’t the only place where human mistakes caused a cascade of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Ilmar Paegle was hired to run the breath-testing program for the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., his first order of business was to test its Intoxilyzers. Mr. Paegle, a retired United States Park Police officer, was stunned: Every machine was generating results that were 20 percent to 40 percent too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That discovery, in 2010, most likely meant that years of faulty tests had convicted innocent drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Paegle’s predecessor, Kelvin King, who oversaw the program for 14 years, had routinely entered incorrect data that miscalibrated the machines, according to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1934-pages-from-paegle-documents/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an affidavit by Mr. Paegle&lt;/a&gt; and a lawsuit brought by convicted drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In addition, Mr. Paegle found, the chemicals the department was using to set up the machines were so old that they had lost their potency — and, in some cases, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1931-11-14-11-opinion-on-king-motion-to-dismiss/213c49d9b3baeabfb77c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. King had brewed his own chemical solutions&lt;/a&gt;. (Mr. King still works for the Metropolitan Police Department. A department spokeswoman said he was unavailable for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Paegle, believing the machines hadn’t been giving reliable results for at least a decade, pulled them out of service. He alerted the city’s attorney general, whose office prosecuted drunken-driving cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The city stopped using breath-test results in new prosecutions, but it only acknowledged problems in cases going back 18 months. The attorney general’s office determined that in that span, 350 people had been convicted based solely on results that were far too high. Lawyers for those drivers were notified that their clients could ask to have their cases reopened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But more than 700 other people also had been convicted after receiving inflated test results. The attorney general’s office didn’t believe those convictions hinged on the breath tests, so it decided not to notify those defendants that their results had been incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The reality, though, was that most of those 700-plus cases had ended in guilty pleas by defendants who thought, wrongly, that prosecutors had infallible scientific evidence that they were drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-21ded45f&quot;&gt;‘SERIOUS ERRORS OF JUDGMENT’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As Mr. Mottor’s case inched along in Massachusetts, a parallel legal fight was playing out: Lawyers representing hundreds of drunken-driving defendants were pelting the state’s courts with requests for more information on the Dräger Alcotest 9510. (Their cases were consolidated into a single action.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2016 — three years after Mr. Mottor was pulled over — the state’s highest court ruled that Massachusetts had to hand over two Alcotest machines. The defense lawyers would be allowed to hire experts to test them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The decision caused paralysis. Prosecutors froze thousands of cases until the review was finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The software experts and scientists who inspected the Alcotest 9510 machines found troubling mistakes, according to their reports to the court. In some circumstances — when the devices’ two testing methods produced substantially different results, for example — the machines were supposed to generate error messages and terminate the test. Instead, the devices printed a result. (Dräger blamed an error by its computer programmers, which it said has now been fixed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the machines weren’t the only problem. The Massachusetts forensic lab, which for years had been plagued by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/02/notification-begins-for-drug-defendants-whose-cases-were-dismissed-because-of-sonja-farak-scandal.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scandals over faked drug test results&lt;/a&gt; and tampered evidence, lacked a written procedure to set up and test machines, the lab’s technical director testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The justice hearing the case, Robert A. Brennan, said the lab could not prove that it had followed a “scientifically sound methodology,” and in 2017 he &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1924-2017-commonwealth-v-ananias-decision/213c49d9b3baeabfb77c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threw out all of its breath test results from 2012 through 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That was only the beginning. Lawyers soon discovered that the lab had hidden records of hundreds of failed calibrations. The discovery provoked &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1925-discovery-practices-at-the-office-of-alcohol-testing/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a state investigation&lt;/a&gt; that blasted the lab’s leadership for “serious errors of judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Brennan later &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1923-memorandum-of-decision-on-cons/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expanded his previous order&lt;/a&gt;: No tests from the lab were admissible until it was accredited by a national board that oversees forensic labs. Eight years of tests — more than 36,000, according to defense lawyers — were suddenly off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Mottor’s trial finally got underway on Jan. 10, 2018. He and his lawyer didn’t realize that his breath test was among those that had been invalidated. It remained the state’s crucial piece of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His lawyer told the court about Mr. Mottor’s shaky balance and metal-filled feet, but the arguments didn’t resonate. The only thing that seemed to matter to the jury was the breath test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The .08 comes in, and to them that’s a conviction,” Mr. Mottor said. He was found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A couple of weeks later, he learned that his breath test never should have been part of the prosecution. He asked to have his case reopened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Mr. Mottor’s request was granted, the prosecutor made him an offer: Plead guilty to a lesser offense, and the drunken-driving charge would be dropped. In February, more than five years after his arrest, Mr. Mottor took the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Even the people in the clerk’s office were high-fiving me afterward,” he said. “They were happy that it was over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since his arrest, Mr. Mottor has maintained a clean driving record. He is still paying off the roughly $30,000 he accrued in fines, court fees and legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1t3dkjq eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-24df4aeb&quot;&gt;42,000 CONVICTIONS AT RISK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nearly 29,000 of the invalidated tests in Massachusetts were already used to convict drivers, state records show. This month, the state will begin informing those defendants that they can seek a new trial, and lawyers are bracing for a flood of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So are lawyers in New Jersey, where more than 13,000 people were found guilty based on &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/nyregion/nj-dwi-convictions-court.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;breath tests from machines that hadn’t been properly set up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Between those two states, at least 42,000 convictions are at risk. Thousands of other defendants have already been acquitted in cases that prosecutors believe they would have won if they had been able to use their most powerful piece of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And recognition of the tests’ problems is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Minnesota, a judge ruled last year that the state’s machines &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/5089-minnesota-order-breath-tests/d785cd5b0e65bdc10755/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appeared to be rounding up results&lt;/a&gt;, falsely nudging some defendants over the legal limit. (A spokeswoman for the state’s testing program said the judge misunderstood the technology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Washington State, where Dräger sent its cease-and-desist letter, D.U.I. lawyers are trying to consolidate a group of cases to challenge the reliability of the state’s machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And in courts around the country — including &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/people-v-manzueta-1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one last year in Queens County, N.Y.&lt;/a&gt; — judges continue to toss out individual cases when questions arise about the tests’ accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If we are going to put people in jail and punish people, take their liberties away, take their licenses away, we have an obligation to be accurate,” said Joseph Bernard, the defense lawyer who helped Mr. Mottor get a new trial and is representing dozens of others in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But there is a cost. Throwing out tens of thousands of faulty breath tests will inevitably let some dangerous drivers back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Let’s not fool each other,” Mr. Bernard said. “I am not going to sit here and tell you that situation and that dynamic isn’t going to happen. Of course it’s going to happen. The question is, whose fault is it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting. Susan Beachy and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Life Is a Ponzi Scheme (2009)</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;__p2&quot; class=&quot;p p-first&quot;&gt;Unless you've spent the last month on a spacecraft returning from Mars, you've probably heard of Bernard Madoff, the American financier who stands accused of perpetrating what may be the greatest investment fraud in history. Estimates of the amount of money lost by investors in the investment fund managed by Madoff, a former chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Market, range up to US$50 billion. One of Madoff's biggest investors, René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, committed suicide on 23 December 2008 following the disclosure of the scheme. Villehuchet is thought to have lost as much as $1.4 billion in Madoff's fund. A number of charitable foundations, several of which provide funding for disease-related biomedical research, lost huge percentages of their endowments. Several universities have been significantly harmed as well, since either some of their own money or the savings of some of their biggest regular donors turned out to have been invested with Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p3&quot;&gt;The particular type of con game that Bernard Madoff practiced is surprisingly simple for someone whose web of deceit appears to have been so tangled. It's called a Ponzi scheme. The fraud takes its name from Charles Ponzi, who was one of the greatest swindlers in history. Born Carlo Ponzi in 1882 in Parma, Italy, he emigrated to the United States in 1903. After working at a series of low-paying jobs for several years, he moved to Montreal in 1907 and became an assistant in a bank that had been set up to serve the needs of Italian immigrants to Canada. The bank eventually failed because of bad real-estate loans - sounds familiar? - but Ponzi stayed on in Canada where eventually he was jailed for three years for check forgery. On his release in 1911 he joined a scheme to smuggle illegal aliens across the border to the United States, was caught, and served a further two years in prison, this time in Atlanta, Georgia. There he met Charles W Morse, a financier who had been convicted of violating federal banking laws. Morse became a sort of guru to Ponzi, who began to see the possibilities in white-collar crime. After his release, Ponzi made his way to Boston, Massachusetts, where he set up the investment scheme that was to make him famous - and notorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p4&quot;&gt;To call his pitch to prospective pigeons attractive would be to understate the case. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States, a form of what we currently call 'arbitrage' (the practice of taking advantage of a difference in price between two or more markets). A simple, and classic, example of arbitrage would be to collect discarded soda cans in Massachusetts, where they are sold with a deposit of $0.05 each, and truck them to Michigan, where the returned deposit is $0.10 per can. (For those of you thinking of funding your research this way, forget it: the cost of collecting and transporting the cans eliminates the profit. However, about $10 million worth of empty bottles and cans do get smuggled into Michigan from neighboring Ohio and Indiana, which do not require a deposit on beverage containers. Returning those out-of-state bottles and cans in Michigan does make a small profit. Michigan lawmakers have proposed requiring that beverage manufacturers put a code on all bottles and cans that are sold in Michigan, and that automated bottle return machines be programmed to read the code so they accept only containers originally sold in Michigan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p5&quot;&gt;Ponzi wasn't arbitraging soda cans, though. The commodity he claimed to be buying and selling was international postal reply coupons. A postal reply coupon is a piece of paper included in a message sent by someone in one country to a correspondent in another country, so the recipient can use the coupon to pay the postage for a reply - the modern equivalent, within one country, is the stamped, self-addressed envelope. What made them attractive for arbitrage is that the coupons were priced at the cost of postage in the country of purchase, but were exchanged for stamps to cover the cost of postage in the country where redeemed; if these values were different, there was a potential profit. Inflation after the First World War had reduced the cost of postage in Italy as expressed in US dollars, so an international postal reply coupon bought in Rome could, in theory, be exchanged in Boston for stamps with a much higher dollar value. As explained by Ponzi, investors would give him money; he would send that money abroad, where his agents would purchase reply coupons; the agents would send the coupons to the US, where Ponzi would redeem them for stamps of a higher value; and he would then sell the stamps. Ponzi claimed that the net profit on these perfectly legal transactions, after expenses and exchange rates, was in excess of 400%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p6&quot;&gt;In the first two months of 1920, some people invested and were paid large returns (100% profit in a few weeks). Word spread, and investment came in at an ever-increasing rate. Ponzi hired agents to drum up new business and paid them generous commissions for every dollar they brought in. At that time all investors were being paid impressive rates, which encouraged others to invest. By May 1920, Ponzi had made $420,000 (over $4.5 million in 2008 dollars). By July 1920, he had made millions. People were mortgaging their homes and investing their life savings in his company. Most did not take their profits out, but reinvested them, believing that the enormous returns would continue forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p7&quot;&gt;What none of them knew was that Charles Ponzi wasn't buying and selling postal reply coupons. In fact, he wasn't arbitraging anything. What he was actually doing was running what is called a pyramid scheme: as long as money kept flowing in at a greater rate than people were withdrawing it, existing investors (the top of the pyramid) could be paid with a portion of the money brought in from the larger horde of new investors (the pyramid bottom). By 24 July 1920, the pyramid scheme was returning for Ponzi's firm, The Securities Exchange Company, the astounding sum of $250,000 a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p8&quot;&gt;Well, my father, who was trained as an economist, always said that if something seems too good to be true, it probably isn't either good or true. Clarence Barron, the financial analyst who founded the financial magazine Barron's, started to examine Ponzi's outrageous returns. Barron first noted that Ponzi hadn't invested his own money with his own company - always a red flag. Then he calculated that, to cover the investments made with the Securities Exchange Company, about 160,000,000 postal reply coupons would have to be in circulation. However, only about 27,000 coupons were actually circulating worldwide. He checked with the US Post Office, who confirmed that postal reply coupons were not being bought or redeemed in large quantities, either at home or abroad. Finally, Barron crunched the numbers, and found the same thing for arbitraging postal reply coupons that you would find if you tried to redeem Massachusetts soda cans in Michigan: the gross profit margin in percent on each item was huge, but the actual return per item was very small, and the overhead required to handle the purchase and redemption of the necessarily huge number of items, which were sold individually, would have far exceeded the gross profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p9&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Boston Post&lt;/em&gt; published the results of Barron's investigation, and ran a headline on 2 August 1920, declaring Ponzi hopelessly insolvent. On 10 August federal agents raided the Securities Exchange Company and shut it down. Of course, they found no large stock of postal reply coupons. On 12 August 1920, Ponzi was arrested. Seventeen thousand people had invested millions, maybe tens of millions, with him over a period of less than nine months. Most lost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p10&quot;&gt;After serving years in prison on both federal and state charges, Charles Ponzi was deported to Italy in 1934. He died a pauper in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro on 18 January 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p11&quot;&gt;It now appears that Bernard Madoff was running a similar pyramid scheme, on a colossal scale. He was cleverer about it, of course, since he had Ponzi's mistakes to learn from. Rather than offer suspiciously high returns to all comers, Madoff instead offered modest, but steady returns (about 10-15% per year). Furthermore, Madoff didn't solicit business; instead, he deliberately made it difficult to invest. By catering to an exclusive clientele, one that had to be both super-rich and selected by him, he drove up the demand for his services through their scarcity. The scheme also differed from Ponzi's in that a number of other investment funds invested much or all of their holdings in Madoff's fund, which meant that many individual investors, who believed they were diversified, unknowingly had all their eggs in the Madoff basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p12&quot;&gt;There were a number of red flags that should have alerted both financial analysts and government regulators to the probably fraudulent nature of Madoff's business (to be fair, a small number, such as Boston financial specialist Harry Markopolos, did sound warnings about Madoff for years, but were ignored). For one, almost identical returns were produced in both up and down markets - an impossibility with honest trading. Another red flag is that the investment method was stated to be a proprietary secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p13&quot;&gt;The slow pace and 'insider' marketing enabled the scheme to survive for an unusually long time and also to grow far larger than would be expected of a common Ponzi scheme. What caused it to collapse? The general market downturn of 2008 caused new investments to decrease and forced a larger than usual number of existing investors to cash out their positions. That's what usually brings down a pyramid scheme: when the top of the pyramid demands more money back than the bottom is putting in ('illiquidity' in finance-speak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p14&quot;&gt;Now, the reason you're reading about this here, is that I just realized that life itself is basically a gigantic Ponzi scheme, and the pyramid is dangerously close to collapsing. In the developed world, we have evolved a society in which a relatively small number of old people have many of their needs cared for through the financial contributions of a larger number of much younger people. And that made sense, because for over 12,000 years the age distribution of the human population was, in fact, in the shape of a pyramid, with a huge base of young children rising to a smaller number of teenagers and a still smaller number of young adults, and so on up to a tiny tip of the elderly. But sometime in the 1950s, as the birthrate declined and life expectancy continued to increase, the pyramid started to be shaped more like a column. Within the next 40 years it will become one, and then it will slowly invert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p15&quot;&gt;Worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth in 1955 was just 48 years; in 1995 it was 65 years; in 2025 it will reach 73 years. By the year 2025, it is expected that no country on Earth will have a life expectancy of less than 50 years. That has never happened before in human history. Globally, the population of children under 5 will grow by just 0.25% annually between 1995-2025, while the population over 65 years will grow by 2.6%. The average number of babies per woman of child-bearing age was 5.0 in 1955, falling to 2.9 in 1995; it will reach 2.3 in 2025. While only 3 countries were below the population replacement level of 2.1 babies in 1955, there will be 102 such countries by 2025. The World Health Organization has estimated that the proportion of older people requiring support from adults of working age will increase globally from 10.5% in 1955 and 12.3% in 1995 to 17.2% in 2025. In 1955, there were 12 people aged over 65 for every 100 aged under 20. By 1995, the old/young ratio was 16/100; by 2025 it will be 31/100. By the end of the century it will approach unity. Eventually - and eventually isn't that far off - we will live in world where a smaller number of young people will be asked to support a larger number of the very old. No Ponzi scheme can survive that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p16&quot;&gt;Consider healthcare. Total healthcare costs in the United States now exceed $1 trillion, 14% of the gross domestic product. Of this total, a disproportionate share is spent on the care of elderly patients shortly before their deaths. Most elderly people have the bulk of their medical care paid for by Medicare, a state-supported program. Workers pay into it during their years of peak employment, and as retirees they then draw down from it as they age. However, the 5% of Medicare recipients 65 years of age and older who die in any one year account for around 30% of all costs of the Medicare program. Seventy-seven percent of the Medicare decedents' total healthcare expenditures occur in their last year of life, a staggering 52% in the last 2 months, and 40% in the last month. We are basically spending a fortune as a society for healthcare for very old, very sick people that does not increase the lifespan of the individual by more than 30 days, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p17&quot;&gt;We could, of course, handle this cost imbalance by draconian decisions about life and death, but that is probably a political (and maybe ethical) non-starter (although don't be surprised if it doesn't become part of the conversation if we don't find other ways to control costs). And the population pyramid would change dramatically if we had a global thermonuclear war or a planet-wide plague, but we probably won't be so lucky. And science may actually be on its way to making the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p18&quot;&gt;There are a number of genomics-driven research programs, some based on model organisms but others involving mammals right up to people, that aim to increase the human lifespan. If successful, they would spell the rapid and certain ruin of the Ponzi-like social contract between old and young, by guaranteeing a completely inverted population pyramid. I believe that it is pointless to increase the human lifespan unless the quality of life for the elderly is also increased. Specifically, this means that we must greatly improve the health of our oldest citizens unless we wish to see our economy collapse, soon, from the burden of caring for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p19&quot;&gt;That's going to be a tall order, because age is a major risk factor for just about everything bad that can happen to a human being. Incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases rises exponentially with age after 65, until people over 80 have almost one chance in two of suffering from one of them. Half of all cancer deaths occur in people over 75 years of age. The greatest risk factor for prostate cancer is age: more than 75% of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over 65. Over 80% of deaths from circulatory disease occur in people over 65. Stroke, the third leading cause of death in the United States (after heart disease and all forms of cancer), is 30 times more likely in men over 90 than it is in those aged 55-59. When you add in bone density loss, arthritis, and other age-related disorders, it's hard not to agree with the Rolling Stones' lyric from the song &lt;em&gt;Mother's Little Helper&lt;/em&gt;: &quot;What a drag it is, getting old.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p20&quot;&gt;Controlling healthcare costs and making sure that everyone can afford basic care, though essential, is not going to be enough in the long run - not with that demographic time-bomb ticking away in the background. Our only hope as a species lies with biomedical research. And that research needs to be aimed at prevention, not just treatment, because it's always more expensive to treat an illness than it is to prevent it. Oddly, we tend to be more easily alarmed by the relatively improbable prospect of epidemics such as avian flu than we are by a certain likelihood that most of us will, if we live long enough, fall prey to devastating chronic ailments. As a result, we invest much more money in planning for and warding off the former than we do in dealing with the latter. This mindset has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;__p21&quot; class=&quot;p p-last&quot;&gt;The line of succession from Charles Ponzi to Bernard Madoff is more than a chronicle of cupidity. It's a microcosm of the way we've organized our society. For thousands of years it made sense to assume that there would always be more young people to pay for the care of older ones. But Ponzi and Madoff failed because they forgot that no pyramid lasts forever. We had better remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spleeter&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deezer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; source separation library with pretrained models written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://tensorflow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-2stems-model&quot;&gt;2 stems&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocals / drums / bass / other separation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-4stems-model&quot;&gt;4 stems&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model&quot;&gt;5 stems&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 stems and 4 stems models have state of the art performances on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;musdb&lt;/a&gt; dataset. &lt;strong&gt;Spleeter&lt;/strong&gt; is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed &lt;strong&gt;Spleeter&lt;/strong&gt; so you can use it straight from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#usage&quot;&gt;command line&lt;/a&gt; as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator&quot;&gt;Python library&lt;/a&gt;. It can be installed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda&quot;&gt;Conda&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-pip&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; or be used with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to try it out ? Just clone the repository and install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda&quot;&gt;Conda&lt;/a&gt; environment to start separating audio file as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter
conda env create -f spleeter/conda/spleeter-cpu.yaml
conda activate spleeter-cpu
spleeter separate -i spleeter/audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:2stems -o output
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should get two separated audio files (&lt;code&gt;vocals.wav&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;accompaniment.wav&lt;/code&gt;) in the &lt;code&gt;output/audio_example&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed documentation, please check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki&quot;&gt;repository wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;AVID, HE OF&lt;/small&gt; the spat with Goliath, is an overused corporate analogy. But it is hard to think of a more appropriate one for Advanced Micro Devices (&lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;). On October 29th the American chipmaking tiddler reported its third-quarter results. Lisa Su, its boss, declared herself “extremely pleased”. No wonder. At $1.8bn, revenue was the highest since 2005. &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; predicted that next quarter’s figures would be equally perky, up 48% on the previous year to $2.1bn. Its share price has risen 15-fold since 2015 (see chart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; is more important to the chip business than its diminutive stature suggests. It provides the only meaningful competition to not one but two Goliaths in two important parts of the semiconductor industry. Its &lt;small&gt;CPU&lt;/small&gt;s—the general-purpose chips at the heart of modern laptops, desktops and data centres—compete with those from Intel, whose $71bn of revenue in 2018 made it the world’s second-biggest chipmaker. Its &lt;small&gt;GPU&lt;/small&gt;s—which provide 3&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; graphics for video games and, increasingly, the computational grunt for trendy machine-learning algorithms—go up against those from Nvidia, whose revenues last year of $11.7bn were nearly twice those of &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;’s purple patch comes mostly from its battles with Intel. Until recently, Intel virtually monopolised the &lt;small&gt;CPU&lt;/small&gt; market. Analysts at Mercury Research reckon that in 2015 its chips accounted for 92.4% of desktop and laptop computers, and 99.2% of the more lucrative market in server chips. Mercury’s most recent numbers put &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;’s share at 14.7% for desktops and laptops. For servers it is a more modest 3.1%—but still five times what it was two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things explain the firm’s resurgence. One is a better product. In 2012 &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; rehired Jim Keller, a well-regarded chip designer who had been at Apple. &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; had long been competing on price—its chips were slower than Intel’s but much cheaper. Mr Keller’s “Zen” chips, unveiled in 2017, are still cheap. But they are now as zippy as Intel’s, or even zippier: &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;’s top-end server chip, for instance, is faster than its Intel counterpart in many tasks, and costs half as much. Zen chips have won a string of contracts with Microsoft and Sony (for new games consoles), Google (data centres) and Cray (supercomputers), among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that, while &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; has improved, Intel has stumbled. The firm makes its own chips. Its latest and greatest manufacturing process, which should have delivered a big performance boost, is years late, leaving the firm to rehash existing designs. &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; contracts most of its manufacturing to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which has now caught up with Intel’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;’s good fortune last? Intel eventually put paid to similarly competitive spells at the turn of the century and in the mid-2000s. It is trying again. In 2018 it hired Mr Keller, this time from Tesla (he had left &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; in 2015). It plans to launch an advanced new manufacturing process in 2021. A planned move into &lt;small&gt;GPU&lt;/small&gt;s could squeeze &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; from another direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt;’s resurgence is good news for consumers, &lt;small&gt;IT&lt;/small&gt; departments, cloud-computing firms and anybody who uses software. Like any good monopolist, Intel charges a steep price for its products—unless &lt;small&gt;AMD&lt;/small&gt; is doing well. Sure enough, Intel’s newest set of desktop chips, due in November, are some of its thriftiest in years. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
