&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDITORS NOTE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27.684971098266&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet Carolina Chaney. Take a good look at &lt;a href=&quot;%20https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=108299683992750&amp;amp;set=a.108299730659412&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;her Facebook profile photo.&lt;/a&gt; Maybe she looks like your kid's math teacher or your doctor. Privacy settings block us from seeing anything about her, but we do see she is one of 11 administrators of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/887399568328028/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Trump - 2020 KAG!#&quot; Facebook group.&lt;/a&gt; Carolina started in that role on Monday, December 9, 2019, and posted two stories on her first day. Those posts suggest that Carolina does not like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebl.com/us-news/ken-starr-says-pelosi-has-arrogance-masquerading-as-patriotism-and-impeachment-is-profoundly-wrong.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebl.com/politics/if-hunter-biden-has-done-nothing-wrong-then-why-is-joe-biden-so-upset.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;former Vice President Joe Biden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't try to send Carolina a friend request. She is a person who does not exist. In fact, Carolina's profile image was created by the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Thompson, a very real person and the authenticity analyst for Lead Stories, found Carolina Chaney and hundreds of other non-existent people serving as administrators and members of dozens of Facebook groups that solely promote the content of TheBL.com, a major web publisher. Thompson's previous investigation connected TheBL.com to hundreds of fake Facebook accounts using images of real people taken from other websites, but now she's discovered a new, unreal tactic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fake profiles help the publisher distort the popularity of its content, which then makes it more likely to show up on someone's timeline. When it is political content - which most often is what TheBL.com publishes - it is especially concerning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TheBL is an undeclared offshoot of The Epoch Times and NTD media. NBC Tech News reporters Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121&quot;&gt;wrote about the connections&lt;/a&gt; between the Epoch Times and Falun Gong in August 2019. Alex Kasprak and Jordan Liles of Snopes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/10/11/pro-trump-outlet-linked-epoch-times/&quot;&gt;uncovered the links&lt;/a&gt; between The Epoch Times and TheBL. I wrote about my own investigation into TheBL network of Facebook pages, groups and profiles for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secjuice.com/author/media-literacy-advocate-exposing-deceptive-practices-in-social-media/&quot;&gt;infosec blog SecJuice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began investigating TheBL network in October 2019, many of their fake Facebook profiles used images taken from the photo-sharing website &lt;a href=&quot;http://unsplash.com&quot;&gt;UnSplash.com&lt;/a&gt;, where photographers allow publishers to use their work for free as long as they are credited. TheBL ignored the credit requirement. The images were mostly young, good looking people of many races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also used repurposed real accounts, sometimes without even changing the name in the link. The URL for the &quot;Kathy Crum&quot; profile (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thom.cuoi&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/thom.cuoi&lt;/a&gt;) retained the name of &quot;Thom Cuoi&quot; for example, indicating the repurposed account originally belonged to someone in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;kathythom.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/xkathythom.jpg.pagespeed.ic.qDS3cVIih0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;973&quot; height=&quot;1176&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-none&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy settings often hid the profile history but sometimes not. I could see that just a few weeks earlier the profile had only posted in the Vietnamese language. The fraudulent nature of these profiles is obvious, yet they've been able to game Facebook for months, using false American identities to run more than 200 political pages and groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profile picture &quot;Kathy&quot; used? An UnSplash stock photo by Allef Vinicius:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embedly-card&quot; data-card-key=&quot;44ee665819f64c0cae2451b526b9590c&quot; data-card-controls=&quot;0&quot; data-card-image=&quot;http://images.unsplash.com/photo-1545928365-5da111f1bb2d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;fm=jpg&amp;amp;crop=entropy&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;amp;w=1080&amp;amp;fit=max&quot; data-card-type=&quot;article-full&quot; readability=&quot;6.0281690140845&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2019 I noticed a change in how TheBL network created new fake profiles. No more UnSplash images. The new faces were headshots which I recognized as having been AI generated, sourced from ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com. Production of new profiles also seems to be speeding up. Most of the 336 synthetic face profiles I found (of which 34 have already been deleted) were created since November 19th. Forty three of them were made on one Saturday - December 7, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Carolina Chaney&quot; was created on Monday morning, December 10, 2019 for example. Just hours later, she was amplifying a link to TheBL.com in one of the network's many groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/e18021f3a62b39651de1d2100af02ff3be08b4ca-3061904.html&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:void(&amp;quot;mce-mt-event-placeholer&amp;quot;);return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/xe18021f3a62b39651de1d2100af02ff3be08b4ca-thumb-900xauto-3061904.jpg.pagespeed.ic.MBsWy_fgYh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Carolinagroupscreen.JPG&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;824&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2019 Twitter was buzzing about the new website from Philip Wang, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&quot;&gt;ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com&lt;/a&gt;. Visitors to the site are greeted by a random face on the screen. There's no article or introduction, just a human face. Refresh the page and a new face appears. You can do this all day and never see the same face twice. If you'd rather see cats, there is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://thiscatdoesnotexist.com&quot;&gt;ThisCatDoesNotExist.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embedly-card&quot; data-card-key=&quot;44ee665819f64c0cae2451b526b9590c&quot; data-card-controls=&quot;0&quot; data-card-type=&quot;article-full&quot; readability=&quot;9.2518337408313&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/15/18226005/ai-generated-fake-people-portraits-thispersondoesnotexist-stylegan&quot;&gt;ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com uses AI to generate endless fake faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of AI to generate fake visuals is not yet mainstream knowledge, but a new website - ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com - offers a quick and persuasive education. The site is the creation of Philip Wang, a software engineer at Uber, and uses research released last year by chip designer Nvidia to create an endless stream of fake portraits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this so compelling is that these people aren't real. The faces were created by an algorithm named StyleGAN developed by NVIDIA. GAN stands for &quot;generative adversarial network.&quot; The adversarial part has to do with two computer systems working together in a competitive way to learn to get better at generating something. In this case, it's making a digital representation of a human face that looks like a photograph. The super-realistic synthetic faces are a high-resolution 1024x1024 pixel square and are copyright free. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf&quot; title=&quot;US Copyright Law&quot;&gt;US Copyright law&lt;/a&gt; says that in order to have a copyright, the image must be made by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be decisive, because if you want to save a picture from ThisPersonDoesNotExist, there's no going back. The face disappears when you refresh the page - replaced by a new image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions of the real people on Twitter when this came out were wide-ranging, from delight to dread. Many people wondered if they might randomly encounter a computer-generated doppelganger. Others predicted that this would be used by scammers and con artists. Actual artists dreamed of creative things that could be done with such realistic copyright free pictures. Some wondered how long it would take before this delightful innovation was used for some dastardly scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, Adam Ghahramani wrote an alarmist piece in &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/03/why-thispersondoesnotexist-and-its-copycats-need-to-be-restricted/&quot;&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; about why this technology should be restricted. I wasn't ready to make up my mind. I wanted to know more. The availability of these faces might broaden a criminal's available choices, but there wasn't anything specific a synthetic face offered that wasn't already available with lower-tech options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More alarm bells rang in June when &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/bc2f19097a4c4fffaa00de6770b8a60d&quot;&gt;Raphael Satter's story&lt;/a&gt; titled &quot;Experts: Spy used AI-generated face to connect with targets&quot; went out on the Associated Press. Some well-connected people in Washington fell for a LinkedIn profile photo of a beautiful woman with auburn hair and a captivating gaze. She was not real, but a real spy was using the GAN image to lure targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Detect A GAN Image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training myself, part one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could learn to spot fake faces generated using the website so that first week I trained with my kids. It felt like playing, but I was studying. We carefully analyzed each image. In this exercise we had a given that 100-percent of the time we knew this was a fake photo. It was our job to pick out quirky clues that confirmed it. Learning the patterns in the hair and the stubble, counting teeth, incisors, canines. We called those iridescent blotches that would appear in some images &quot;beetles.&quot; We laughed at the funny hats that were sized to fit the entire hairstyle and not just the head. There were some men who seemed to be wearing a needle-felted toupee, and none of the women had a matching pair of earrings. (Kyle McDonald wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kcimc/how-to-recognize-fake-ai-generated-images-4d1f6f9a2842&quot;&gt;an excellent guide&lt;/a&gt; on these telltale signs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training myself, part two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West of Calling Bullshit with their practice tool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whichfaceisreal.com/&quot;&gt;WhichFaceIsReal.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was just what I was hoping for: a game that presented a real and a fake face next to each other. Now we had a different challenge, we know one of the photos is fake, but which one? Test-taking strategies can come in to play now. Just guessing randomly could give us a score of 50-percent, but now we had the advantage of being able to rule out the synthetic one if we could identify something real in the other photo. With this tool we learned a new set of things that only real people can have in their photos that the computer-generated face pictures don't. Things like logos, zippers, printed patterns, hands, watches, identifiable things in the background... and friends. We kept score. Then I tried for speed, I tried to learn to trust my instincts. I wanted it to become second nature. It wasn't easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting for synthetic faces in the wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already formulating some ideas about geometry when I came across an image from Conspirator0 and Dr ZQ that provided the key I needed. They shared this haunting ethereal visage on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;8.2554517133956&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Roughly a week ago, an AI for generating synthetic faces was made publicly available at thispersondoesnotexist(dot)com. We used it to generate 5000 sample faces. Pictured below is the result of blending all 5000 images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cc: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/F2qTqKPSMu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/F2qTqKPSMu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
-- Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1096877542521344002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 16, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the comments on this thread misinterpreted what they were seeing. They thought this blur was some sort of an average face. It's not. What this otherwise blurry image is depicting are eyes as anchor points. That no matter which way the faces were looking, left, right or center, the eyes were all rendered in the same position in the square. What an important revelation! The sample set of real human faces that were fed into the StyleGAN program had all been positioned, sized and cropped so that their eyes were a constant given position within the 1024x1024 pixel square. The resulting output reflects that underlying data structure. This geometric &quot;rule&quot; is then carried by the synthetic faces in the bounds of that perfect square -- into the bounds of a circular profile photo on Facebook, automatically snapping into place the way circles in squares do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows eight synthetic profiles which were made by TheBL in November and all have names beginning with S: Smith, Smith, Smith, Shane, Scott, Susan, Sue and Sammy. Notice how the look of the image changes when it is cropped as a circle, but that at the widest and tallest dimensions -- none of the image has been lost. The large central image was made by layering all eight profiles on top of each other. Not the same process and Conspirador0 and Dr ZQ used -- but enough layers to get the idea across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/BlendedCollage-3061909.html&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:void(&amp;quot;mce-mt-event-placeholer&amp;quot;);return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/xBlendedCollage-thumb-900xauto-3061909.jpg.pagespeed.ic.TcZDLsZguQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BlendedCollage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;749&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this geometry could be defeated by someone who cared to mix it up. There is another &lt;a href=&quot;https://generated.photos/&quot;&gt;website offering stock photo synthetic faces&lt;/a&gt; with a neutral background that can easily be made rectangular, unlike the random assortment offered up by ThisPersonDoesNotExist, their website format allows you to browse through a collection. Whoever is churning out the fake profiles for TheBL (it could be automated) is not even matching the fake names to the apparent gender of the synthetic faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of four of those, Andy, Kim, Pamela and William.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/gridonsquares-3061912.html&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:void(&amp;quot;mce-mt-event-placeholer&amp;quot;);return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/xgridonsquares-thumb-900xauto-3061912.jpg.pagespeed.ic.WuN0V5opro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gridonsquares.jpg&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at them as they appear cropped into a Facebook profile. (Note: Garwood Pamela's rectangular profile box has a slightly different dimension because that picture got one like on Facebook.) In the middle row I put the square of the 5,000 face blend behind a slightly transparent layer of the profiles, and in the bottom row we can compare them side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadstories.com/profileswithblended.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;profileswithblended.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/xprofileswithblended-thumb-900xauto-3061915.jpg.pagespeed.ic.rsSuMy9Utr.jpg&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What does it look like when TheBL installs an entire Facebook group administration team consisting of fake profiles made with synthetic faces?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/AllignedAdmins-3061917.html&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:void(&amp;quot;mce-mt-event-placeholer&amp;quot;);return false&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://leadstories.com/assets_c/2019/12/xAllignedAdmins-thumb-autox1757-3061917.jpg.pagespeed.ic.B-fvq0U3yS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AllignedAdmins.jpg&quot; class=&quot;mt-image-center&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1757&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These synthetic face profiles are just as fake as any of the other BL profiles made with the photos from Unsplash. Inauthentic behavior is inauthentic behavior, no matter how it's dressed up. Some fake profiles never offer a face at all. It could be a bald eagle, a puppy, an American flag, or a bouquet of flowers (they are also doing lots of flowers now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead Stories has reported all fake profiles we found to Facebook just before publication of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come back next week as we'll take a closer look at what kind of content these fake people are putting out, and we'll also be examining some of the tools their &quot;operators&quot; seem to be using. Also expect some more information on what could be behind those flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of physics, nothing gets the blood flowing like the thought that a new particle has been discovered. For decades now, physicists have been hunting for evidence that modern physics isn’t right. But, the smoking gun has remained elusive. In November, people started polishing a Nobel prize for a group of physicists who seemed to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459&quot;&gt;found new boson&lt;/a&gt;. And, a new boson means a new force, which is even more exciting. Is that gun smoking yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sometimes the gun just smolders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result has been cooking for quite some time. The first experimental results date back to 2015, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.042501&quot;&gt;publication in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, the scientists took some lithium and shot protons at it. By choosing the energy of the protons correctly, Beryllium in a particular excited state is produced, which quickly decays back to lithium by emitting an electron and a positron. Now, in these experiments, energy and momentum must be conserved. The lithium nucleus is quite a complicated beast and can rattle around in all sorts of ways, meaning that the electron and positron have a certain amount of freedom in the direction in which they are emitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the researchers observed that some electrons and positrons seem to be correlated in their emission direction. Computer modeling confirmed that this was not due to their equipment and could not be explained by the nuclear physics of beryllium, lithium, or any known background process. The correlation could, however, be explained by a new boson that decayed by emitting a positron and an electron. As long as the production was reasonably inefficient, and the mass was about 17MeV (million electron volts), then the data was beautifully explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper really got the juices flowing. Theorists jumped on the result so fast they inadvertently broke special relativity. Experimental physicists went back through old data searching for confirmation. Operating experiments were tweaked to look for the new particle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimentally, it all seemed a wash. Old data revealed nothing, but, at the same time, those experiments weren’t exactly set up to look for the right particle. New experiments were still too fresh to be conclusive (even if they had started taking data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Look, if we just tweak the Universe…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory situation is even more of a mess. It is always possible to extend our models of the Universe to include new particles, including new bosons and new forces. But, it isn’t good enough to match a single experimental result. You have to match all of them. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.071803&quot;&gt;end results&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07198&quot;&gt;particles that&lt;/a&gt; look a bit like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/11/25/has-a-new-force-of-nature-been-discovered/&quot;&gt;backyard panel-beating job&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, the paint matches, but you can still see the wavy patches where the filler hasn’t been sanded flat. The problems arise from the mass—17MeV is at the low end of well-explored territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why did this story flare back up again? A new paper, by the same scientists that published the beryllium results. This time, they measured electron-positron emissions from excited helium. Same experiment, different atom, but the same 17MeV boson was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459&quot;&gt;new result&lt;/a&gt; is pretty strong evidence. If the experiment has some kind of systematic error in it, then we would expect that the “new” particle would change mass between helium and beryllium. It doesn’t, though; the results are very consistent between experiments. That means that if it is an error, it is an unfortunately flukey one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think more scientists would be happier to accept the result if it fit their expectations. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion&quot;&gt;axion&lt;/a&gt; with a mass as small as a few MeV? Sure thing. A giant WIMP with a mass of many GeV? Ok. But, a boson that is lighter than a proton and kind of middle of the road? Why haven’t we seen that before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be, I think, a certain amount of unconscious snobbery in the background. The experimental results haven’t come from any of the big labs. And now the big labs are going to be putting planned experiments on hold to see if a result that they won’t get credit for stands up. If they find the boson, then, great, they’ve won plaudits for someone else. But, if that gun doesn’t smoke, there will be a long and painful search for what makes the original experiment different from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ArXiv.org&quot;&gt;ArXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;, 2019, ID: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459&quot;&gt;1910.10459&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Guide to Software Defined Radio</title>
<link>https://luaradio.io/new-to-sdr.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://luaradio.io/new-to-sdr.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software-defined radio is a radio implemented with reconfigurable software, which processes the raw samples of a digitized radio signal. This differs from conventional hardware radios, which employ RF circuits and digital signal processors to implement this processing in a way that is hardwired and hardcoded to their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software-defined radios offer the allure of instant reconfigurability in every dimension: frequency, modulation, and protocol. In theory, you would simply run a different program to implement an entirely different radio — whether it’s a FM broadcast receiver, a UMTS handset, or a Bluetooth device. While there are still real-world limitations to this dream, particularly in antennas and in host processing power, software-defined radio today is a powerful technology for building flexible communication systems, exploring the radio frequency spectrum, and for protocol research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software-defined radio still requires some hardware, but this hardware is relegated to just receiving and transmitting radio signals. In total, a software-defined radio system consists of an antenna, a transmitter and/or receiver, and a host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/figure-sdr-receiver.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When receiving, the antenna converts electromagnetic waves into a voltage signal, which is then amplified, translated down from the tuning frequency, and sampled by an SDR receiver. The digital samples are streamed to the host for processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/figure-sdr-transmitter.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When transmitting, the host streams digital samples to an SDR transmitter, which converts them into a voltage signal and translates it to the tuning frequency. The voltage signal may then be further amplified by an external amplifier and filtered by a transmit filter, before it is radiated by the antenna as electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional hardware radios today increasingly resemble software-defined radios internally, as more of their processing is pushed into the digital domain, and more complex protocols demand integrated CPUs. However, they are still tightly integrated black boxes that are designed to operate on a specific frequency band, whereas software-defined radios provide a raw sample interface and tend to have a wide tuning range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-state&quot;&gt;Current State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software-defined radio has become increasingly accessible over the past years with the commoditization of high performance CPUs, and the availability of low cost, high rate analog to digital converters (ADCs) and digital to analog converters (DACs) that are responsible for sampling and synthesizing the radio signal. The inexpensive $20 RTL-SDR dongle — described in more detail below — has also played a role in exposing the technology to many engineers and hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the software of software-defined radio has yet to catch up to the hardware. Much of it is scattered across esoteric one-off decoding programs, trapped in frameworks bloated with boilerplate and dependencies, or confined to proprietary Windows software. There has been little consolidation of common code by the way of libraries, and even less effort on good documentation. Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning. Lightweight signal processing libraries are gaining traction, modern open source SDR applications are cropping up, and the developer communities surrounding SDR are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this guide covers the details of getting started with SDR receivers, including hardware, software, a tour of the frequency bands, next steps, and additional resources. Most of this introduction focuses on SDR receivers, but SDR transmitters are touched on briefly in the next steps section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-specifications&quot;&gt;Basic Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software-defined radio receiver is defined by three basic specifications: bandwidth, resolution, and tuning range. The receiver is further characterized by many important figures of merit that reflect performance in noise, selectivity, and frequency stability, but these specifications are deferred to more advanced discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandwidth is the instantaneous width of frequency content that the SDR receiver can receive. It can be thought of as the width of the SDR’s window into the RF spectrum. This is usually in the range of 1 to 10 MHz for entry-level SDR receivers, and in the 20 to 60 MHz range for the more advanced SDR transceivers. Bandwidth is different from tuning frequency; rather, more bandwidth means that the SDR receiver can capture a wider window of signals simultaneously when tuned to a particular frequency. In some cases, more bandwidth is required to capture a very wide signal, like a 6 MHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T&quot;&gt;DVB-T&lt;/a&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample rate of an SDR receiver is the rate the radio signal is sampled by the receiver and streamed to the host. Sample rate is directly related to the bandwidth, and while bandwidth is ultimately the specification of interest, SDRs are typically described by their sample rate, as it is the underlying design parameter. An SDR’s effective bandwidth is usually slightly less than its sample rate. Sample rate also dictates the computational burden on the host: the wider the receive bandwidth, the more samples per second are required to represent it, and consequently, the more bus throughput is required to stream it to the host, and the more host computational power is required to process it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution is the bit resolution of the analog to digital converter that samples the radio signal. This represents the quantization range of each sample. For example, an 8-bit ADC will have 256 levels of quantization, whereas as 12-bit ADC will have 4096 levels. All things equal, more bit resolution means less quantization noise — the “noise” resulting from the error in mapping an analog level onto a discrete level, and more dynamic range — the ability to capture both strong and weak signals simultaneously. In practice, the usable resolution is highly dependent on the signal conditioning by the frontend RF circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning range is the frequency range that the SDR receiver can tune to. This range typically starts in the tens of megahertz and goes up to a few gigahertz. However, SDR receivers can receive signals outside of this range with the help of an RF upconverter or downconverter, an inline device that translates signals by a fixed frequency offset, so that they fall into the tuning range of the SDR. For example, an SDR receiver with a tuning range of 24 MHz to 1766 MHz can be paired with a 125 MHz RF upconverter, so that it can pick up 0 to 30 MHz at the offset frequencies of 125 to 155 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bandwidth, resolution, and tuning range are the basic specifications of an SDR receiver, other figures of merit and design considerations can dramatically affect an SDR receiver’s fidelity and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rtl-sdr-dongle&quot;&gt;RTL-SDR dongle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inexpensive way to get started with SDR is the RTL-SDR dongle. The original incarnation of this dongle and its chipset was marketed as a digital television and audio broadcast receiver, particularly for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T&quot;&gt;DVB-T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting&quot;&gt;DAB/DAB+&lt;/a&gt; protocols, which are used in parts of Europe and Asia. Eventually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr#history_and_discovery_of_rtlsdr&quot;&gt;a few developers discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the demodulating and decoding for the DAB+ and FM receiver modes of this device was actually implemented in the closed-source software itself, and in those modes, the underlying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;amp;PFid=35&amp;amp;Level=4&amp;amp;Conn=3&amp;amp;ProdID=257&quot;&gt;Realtek RTL2832U&lt;/a&gt; chip streamed raw samples over USB. In other words, the dongle was a software-defined radio receiver in those modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the RTL2832U enjoys the economy of scale of mass-produced consumer silicon, it makes it possible to build an inexpensive SDR receiver hardware stack based on the chip for sampling, and an accompanying tuner chip for the RF frontend and tuning. Soon, third-parties started manufacturing dongles based on the RTL2832U with improved tuners, noise performance, frequency stability, and more convenient RF connectors, marketed specifically for software-defined radio use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTL-SDR dongles can deliver a bandwidth of up to approximately 2.5 MHz reliably, have 8-bit resolution, and a tuning range of 24 MHz to 1766 MHz (with the currently popular R820T2 tuner). However, not all RTL-SDR dongles are made equal. The generic ones found for under $10 on eBay may have inferior noise performance and frequency stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two popular dongles that have been vetted by the community are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/&quot;&gt;RTL-SDR Blog silver dongle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-mini-2-plus.html&quot;&gt;NooElec blue dongle&lt;/a&gt;. Both run about $20, and you can’t go wrong with either one. See this &lt;a href=&quot;http://rtlsdr4everyone.blogspot.com/p/review.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed testing on a variety of dongles, including these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/rtlsdr-blog-silver-dongle-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; RTL-SDR Blog Silver Dongle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-mini-2-plus.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/nooelec-blue-dongle-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NooElec Blue Dongle&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;antennas&quot;&gt;Antennas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most “software-undefined” component of software-defined radio is the antenna. It is also one of most important. Good reception on a particular frequency band primarily depends on the antenna configuration. Antennas vary in design frequency, bandwidth, directionality, and polarization, and different applications demand different requirements in these properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antenna’s physical size is typically proportional to the wavelengths it is designed to receive. For example, antennas designed for reception at 15 MHz tend to be much larger than those designed for 100 MHz, and especially larger than a WiFi antenna designed for 2.4 GHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/rtlsdr-stock-antenna-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt; Stock antenna, included&lt;br/&gt;with some RTL-SDR dongles

&lt;p&gt;For example, the small stock monopole antenna that comes with some RTL-SDR dongles (often the generic ones) is limited in performance and frequency response to higher UHF frequencies. Users may be disappointed when they are not able to pick up much aside from some UHF signals and very strong FM stations. But this is entirely to be expected for an antenna of its design and size, especially when used indoors and at a low elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wideband antennas, or antennas that can receive a broad range of frequencies, are popular with SDRs, as they can accommodate the wide tuning range of the SDR. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna&quot;&gt;discone&lt;/a&gt; is a common wideband antenna design. However, to get the most performance out of any dedicated antenna, it should be placed outdoors and at high elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/rtlsdr-blog-dongle-antenna-kit-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; RTL-SDR Blog&lt;br/&gt;Dongle+Antenna Kit
&lt;p&gt;For getting started with SDR, without initially investing too much time, money, or real estate for an antenna, the RTL-SDR Blog’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/1SLPS6F&quot;&gt;RTL-SDR dongle and antenna package&lt;/a&gt; is probably the all-around best entry level kit. The included tall 1.5m telescopic antenna performs decently for VHF signals, even when used indoors, and the shorter 20cm telescopic antenna covers much of the UHF band, so these two antennas can adjusted to most of the operating range of the RTL-SDR. All of the VHF LuaRadio examples (WBFM, NBFM, AX.25, POCSAG, RDS) can be run with the tall 1.5m telescopic antenna indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the earliest SDR software has its origins in the late 90s, with dial-up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem&quot;&gt;software modems&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. the U.S. Robotics “WinModem”) that implemented the majority of the modem in software, allowing for more inexpensive hardware. Other early SDR software was software support for amateur radio digital modes (FSK, PSK31, PACTOR, AX.25, etc.) that were modulated in the audio band. Amateur radio operators could interface the audio of their radio transceivers to their PC’s sound card, and use software to receive or transmit these digital modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound card operated digital modes are still popular in the amateur radio community today, and there is an abundance of older decoding software from this era in use or under maintenance. Some of this software has been retrofitted to support modern I/Q sampling SDR receivers like the RTL-SDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, SDR software seems to broadly fall under five categories: waterfall receivers, standalone decoders, frameworks, libraries, and web interfaces. Below is a Linux-biased sampling of active SDR software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waterfall-receivers&quot;&gt;Waterfall Receivers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfall receivers are characterized by a real-time vertical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram&quot;&gt;spectrogram&lt;/a&gt;, showing the frequency spectrum of the SDR receiver’s passband over time. Waterfall receivers also simulate many functions of a wideband hardware RF receiver, like tuning, demodulation modes, filters, and listening to demodulated audio. Waterfall receivers are useful for exploring the RF spectrum and selectively demodulating parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;standalone-decoders&quot;&gt;Standalone Decoders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standalone decoders are applications written to specifically decode one or more digital modulations and protocols, like aircraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast&quot;&gt;ADS-B&lt;/a&gt; transmissions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POCSAG&quot;&gt;POCSAG&lt;/a&gt; pager messages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;libraries&quot;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libraries provide digital signal processing routines, without imposing a particular paradigm on their integration. They are a lightweight alternative to frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;frameworks&quot;&gt;Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks offer a suite of operations and an API to flexibly define custom receivers, transmitters, or signal processing in general. These are useful for rapidly prototyping SDR projects, but may also be integrated into standalone applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-interfaces&quot;&gt;Web Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web interfaces provide a browser frontend to an SDR, often with server-side processing for demodulation and decoding, and a client-side waterfall and audio. They are like a waterfall receiver accessible through a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;radio-bands&quot;&gt;Radio Bands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/figure-itu-bands.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radio spectrum is split up contiguously into named regions called bands. Each band refers to a range of frequencies. Several international standards have demarcated and named the radio spectrum bands, but in this introduction we’ll stick to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum#ITU&quot;&gt;ITU designations&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. HF, VHF, UHF, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio spectrum bands are not a pure commodity; a slice of the HF band is not equivalent to a slice of the VHF band. This is because electromagnetic waves of different radio frequencies have different interactions with the atmosphere and earth, and this affects their propagation. Propagation on certain bands may be sensitive to time of day, space weather, and solar weather. Propagation on other radio bands may depend mostly on line of sight, and may only be sensitive to terrestrial weather. The atmosphere may also present more or less opacity for different frequencies to outer space, depending on the radio band. In effect, the various radio bands offer varying locality, which enables different kinds of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bandwidth for each ITU band is not divided equally, but rather logarithmically. Each subsequent band has approximately ten times the bandwidth of the previous. This turns out to be a useful assignment, because the frequencies within many of these bands have roughly similar propagation characteristics. However, this also means that each frequency band — characterized by a mode of propagation — offers different amounts of spectrum compared to other frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, 802.11b WiFi operates around 2.4 GHz in the UHF band (300 MHz to 3 GHz). A single 802.11b WiFi channel is 22 MHz wide, which amounts to only 0.8% of the UHF band, but on the HF band (3 to 30 MHz), that single channel would require more than 80% of the entire band — not to mention the propagation related reasons that this would be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of spectrum available in a band dictates the bandwidth of signals you can fit in the band, especially if the band is shared among multiple users. For digital signals, this also dictates the maximum achievable data rate (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity&quot;&gt;channel capacity&lt;/a&gt;). This is one reason that high data rate wireless technologies today occupy spectrum in bands up in the gigahertz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a tour of the more common ITU frequency bands, including their primary mode of propagation and what kind of signals can be found on them. These descriptions are by no means complete; spectrum allocation is complicated and region dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lf&quot;&gt;LF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-lf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for LF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency&quot;&gt;low frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (LF) spans from 30 kHz to 300 kHz. Signals on LF primary propagate by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_wave#Ground_wave&quot;&gt;ground wave&lt;/a&gt; propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to limited spectrum in this band, LF is home mainly to low data rate digital signals. In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_clock#Longwave_and_shortwave_transmissions&quot;&gt;time stations&lt;/a&gt; which “atomic” clocks synchronize their time to (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB&quot;&gt;WWVB&lt;/a&gt; at 60 kHz), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon&quot;&gt;non-directional beacons&lt;/a&gt; used for navigation. In the past, the upper half of the band carried ~9 kHz wide amplitude modulated audio broadcasting in some regions, and a few stations are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longwave#List_of_long-wave_broadcasting_transmitters&quot;&gt;still operating&lt;/a&gt;, but this has largely been phased out over the years and replaced with broadcasting on MF or VHF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some region-dependent amateur radio allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;MF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-mf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for MF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_frequency&quot;&gt;medium frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (MF) spans from 300 kHz to 3000 kHz. Signals on MF propagate by both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_wave#Ground_wave&quot;&gt;ground wave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave&quot;&gt;skywave&lt;/a&gt; propagation, but the lower two-thirds of the band typically only propagate well by skywave at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower portion of the band, up to 500 kHz, is used for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon&quot;&gt;non-directional beacons&lt;/a&gt;, like in LF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the band, from ~520 kHz to ~1600 kHz, is dedicated to ~9 kHz wide amplitude modulated audio broadcasting, commonly called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_radio&quot;&gt;AM radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above AM radio, there is an international amateur radio allocation from 1800 kHz to 2000 kHz, named the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/160-meter_band&quot;&gt;160 meter band&lt;/a&gt;. This band is the start of amateur radio privileges in many countries. Amateur radio is discussed in more detail in the Amateur Radio section under Next Steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasting begins again at 3000 kHz and up. However, the aforementioned 160 meter amateur radio band and this broadcasting band are colloquially lumped into HF, in part because their propagation mode is inclined to skywave propagation, and frequencies from 1600 kHz to 30 MHz were historically called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio&quot;&gt;shortwave&lt;/a&gt;. These allocations will be covered in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, MF carries assorted region-dependent emergency communications in some of the open patches between 1600 kHz to 3000 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since AM radio station signals in the MF band are capable of propagating by skywave under the right conditions, there is a hobby called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW_DX&quot;&gt;medium wave DXing&lt;/a&gt; for the long distance reception (“DXing”) of AM radio stations across state or nation boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hf&quot;&gt;HF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-hf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for HF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency&quot;&gt;high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (HF) spans from 3 MHz (3000 kHz) to 30 MHz. Signals on HF propagate primarily by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave&quot;&gt;skywave&lt;/a&gt; propagation, in which signals skip between the Earth and the ionosphere, enabling them to travel international and transoceanic distances. However, this propagation is sensitive to space and solar weather conditions, as those phenomena affect the ionosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the radio spectrum is an ocean, then the HF band is its coral reefs. Crowded and full of diverse international life, the HF band — commonly called shortwave — is a global meeting point on the radio spectrum. With radio, this electromagnetic conduit and natural wonder forms an infrastructure that enables worldwide communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortwave is well known for its international radio broadcasts, whose allocations are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio#Frequency_allocations&quot;&gt;scattered throughout&lt;/a&gt; the HF band. Shortwave radio stations typically broadcast 10 kHz wide amplitude modulated audio. Many stations are government-run, providing news, culture, and propaganda to domestic and international audiences. These stations often broadcast in several languages, and may use directional antennas to target their transmissions towards particular regions, e.g. the Voice of America Africa service. Some government-run stations are public service stations, like the time stations &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHU_(radio_station)&quot;&gt;CHU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)&quot;&gt;WWV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVH&quot;&gt;WWVH&lt;/a&gt;, which broadcast continuously with voice announcements of the time, or digital marine weather and news stations, which may use protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioteletype&quot;&gt;RTTY&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofax&quot;&gt;Weatherfax&lt;/a&gt; to carry text and images, modulated in the audioband of ~3 kHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation&quot;&gt;single-sideband&lt;/a&gt; modulated transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although shortwave broadcasting is dominated by government-sponsored stations, private shortwave broadcasting exists too. In the US, much of it is religious, with a few stations that carry music and talk programs. For a complete schedule of shortwave radio stations, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://short-wave.info/&quot;&gt; https://short-wave.info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HF band is home to many international &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#High_frequency&quot;&gt;amateur radio allocations&lt;/a&gt;, where amateurs can carry out morse, voice, or digital communication with one another. Voice modes are usually ~3 kHz wide single-sideband modulated audio. Digital modes are typically modulated in the audioband within these single-sideband audio transmissions. Morse code uses a modulation method called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave&quot;&gt;continuous wave&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-off_keying&quot;&gt;on-off keyed&lt;/a&gt; carrier. HF amateur radio operators often participate in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting&quot;&gt;contests&lt;/a&gt; to make the most contacts in a limited period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military has a presence on HF as well, often for air force and navy related communications. Some governments have run &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station&quot;&gt;numbers stations&lt;/a&gt; at some point in time to deliver instructions to the military or agents operating on foreign soil. Several numbers stations continue to operate to this day. Many number stations use ordinary amplitude modulated broadcasts that can be received by any shortwave radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HF is also used as backup commercial aviation and maritime communication. Aircraft on trans-oceanic flights are required to be equipped with an HF transceiver. The international maritime distress and calling frequency is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2182_kHz&quot;&gt;2182 kHz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable allocation towards the upper end of the HF band at 27 MHz is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio&quot;&gt;Citizen Band radio&lt;/a&gt;. This allocation provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service&quot;&gt;personal radio service&lt;/a&gt;, allowing local unlicensed communication for individuals. CB radio uses ~10 kHz wide narrowband frequency modulated audio, rather than the amplitude modulation that is common throughout the HF band. Despite its upstanding name, CB radio has a reputation for offensive trucker banter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While shortwave broadcasting as a medium for news and culture has largely been superseded by the internet, it still continues to serve rural communities, and is slowly undergoing a modernization push towards digital, with protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Radio_Mondiale&quot;&gt;Digital Radio Mondiale&lt;/a&gt;, or Voice of America’s pilot &lt;a href=&quot;https://voaradiogram.net/&quot;&gt;Radiogram&lt;/a&gt; project, which carries news text and images over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_MFSK&quot;&gt;Olivia MFSK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that while the internet is decentralized in protocol and spirit, its infrastructure is inherently centralized physically, built with fiber optic, coaxial, and twisted pair cables, and the occasional satellite link. The HF band, although drastically limited in bandwidth compared to the internet, is nature’s “fiber optic cable” that will continue to carry transmissions worldwide from a lantern battery &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation&quot;&gt;or less&lt;/a&gt;, even when all of the grid lights are out. In this sense, HF is a curiosity as a truly decentralized communication medium, in both the network and physical layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vhf&quot;&gt;VHF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-vhf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for VHF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency&quot;&gt;very high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (VHF) spans from 30 MHz to 300 MHz. Signals on VHF propagate primarily by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation&quot;&gt;line of sight propagation&lt;/a&gt;, similar to light. However, VHF radio waves experience a slightly farther horizon than visible light, called the radio horizon, due to refraction in the atmosphere for these frequencies. VHF radio waves can penetrate non-metallic objects like drywalls, although with attenuation, and can reflect off of large metallic objects like buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately a quarter of the VHF band is dedicated to audio and television broadcasting. The common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting&quot;&gt;FM radio&lt;/a&gt; broadcasting sits at ~87 to ~108 MHz, carrying ~200 kHz wide frequency modulated audio. Television broadcasting allocations vary from region to region, but typically are comprised of two contiguous bands in the 40 MHz to 80 MHz range, and one large band in the 170 to 216 MHz range. Most television broadcasting has switched to digital, using the ~5 to 8 MHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T&quot;&gt;DVB-T&lt;/a&gt; protocol in much of the world, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television&quot;&gt;ASTC&lt;/a&gt; protocol in North America. Some regions have reallocated 174 to 230 MHz from television to digital audio broadcasting, with the ~1500 kHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting&quot;&gt;DAB&lt;/a&gt; protocol, in an effort to eventually upgrade from analog FM radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VHF has aviation and marine navigation and emergency communication allocations. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range&quot;&gt;VHF Omnidirectional Range&lt;/a&gt; (VOR) navigation beacons sit directly above FM radio broadcasting, at 108 to 118 MHz. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airband&quot;&gt;airband&lt;/a&gt; spans from 118 to 137 MHz for air traffic control communication, and uses ~10 kHz wide amplitude modulation audio (in contrast to most frequency modulated audio signals on VHF). &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_VHF_radio&quot;&gt;Marine VHF&lt;/a&gt; uses ~16 kHz wide frequency modulated audio in the 156 to 162 MHz range. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System&quot;&gt;Automatic Identification System&lt;/a&gt; (AIS) is a position reporting system used by ships, located at the end of the Marine VHF band. AIS uses a ~10 kHz wide digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-shift_keying#Gaussian_minimum-shift_keying&quot;&gt;GMSK&lt;/a&gt; modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur radio typically has two main allocations on VHF, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-meter_band&quot;&gt;6 meter band&lt;/a&gt; from 50 to 54 MHz and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band&quot;&gt;2 meter band&lt;/a&gt; from 144 to 148 MHz. The 6 meter is a somewhat experimental band, exhibiting long distance skywave and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_E_propagation&quot;&gt;sporadic E&lt;/a&gt; propagation under certain seasonal and meteorological conditions. The 2 meter band is a very popular amateur radio band for voice communications, often supported by local &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater&quot;&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt; that receive and rebroadcast transmissions from a high elevation for extended reception, and used for amateur satellite &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band#Satellite_communications&quot;&gt;uplink&lt;/a&gt;. Amateur radio operation on VHF is typically ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated audio, carrying voice or a digital protocol like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AX.25&quot;&gt;AX.25&lt;/a&gt; for packet radio, but can also be ~3 kHz wide single-sideband modulated audio, or even continuous wave for morse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VHF band has numerous allocations for licensed business and public service two-way radio communication. Many of these still use analog frequency modulated audio, but some carry digital protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio&quot;&gt;DMR&lt;/a&gt; and may even be multiplexed with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunked_radio_system&quot;&gt;trunked radio system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, unlicensed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service&quot;&gt;personal radio service&lt;/a&gt; is also provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Use_Radio_Service&quot;&gt;MURS&lt;/a&gt; allocation from ~151 to ~154 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;uhf&quot;&gt;UHF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-uhf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for UHF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency&quot;&gt;ultra high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (UHF) spans from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. Signals on UHF propagate primarily by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation&quot;&gt;line of sight propagation&lt;/a&gt;, like in VHF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UHF is by far the most diverse band with respect to devices and digital modulations. Its short wavelengths allow for efficient, compact antennas, which can be easily integrated into portable electronics and small appliances, like mobile phones or WiFi routers. UHF is the primary spectral medium for cellular and wireless technologies today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like VHF, UHF has some allocations for audio and television broadcasting. Television broadcasting spans from approximately 470 to 800 MHz, using the digital ~5 to 8 MHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T&quot;&gt;DVB-T&lt;/a&gt; protocol in much of the world, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC_standards&quot;&gt;ASTC&lt;/a&gt; protocol in North America. Audio broadcasting is also available in some regions in the 1452 to 1492 MHz band, with the ~1500 kHz wide digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting&quot;&gt;DAB&lt;/a&gt; protocol. DAB/DAB+ is the leading standard in replacing analog FM broadcast radio in most of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 20% of the UHF band is allocated for cellular technologies. The allocations vary by region, and depending on the carrier that owns the band, may carry different protocols, e.g. GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), or LTE (4G). Allocations tend to exist near 800 to 900 MHz and near 1700 to 2200 MHz bands. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies&quot;&gt;cellular frequencies&lt;/a&gt; page on Wikipedia for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important set of international allocations are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&quot;&gt;Industrial, Scientific and Medical&lt;/a&gt; (ISM) bands. Despite their catch-all name, the vast majority of low power local wireless technologies, from garage door openers and weather sensors, to WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and NFC, all use these bands. The ISM bands were originally intended to isolate noisy electromagnetic devices, like microwaves at 2.45 GHz or some medical devices, from clean spectrum reserved for communications. In effect, the ISM bands were unlicensed wild west zones in the spectrum and any devices designed for it needed to be robust to incidental interference. Over time, low power local wireless technologies have proliferated on these bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UHF band has two major ISM allocations. The lower frequency one ranges from ~433 to ~435 MHz in ITU region 1 (e.g. Europe, Africa, Middle East), or from 902 to 928 MHz in ITU region 2 (e.g. Americas, Greenland). These bands are often called 433 MHz or 915 MHz, respectively, and are frequently used for low data rate signaling devices, like key fobs or home alarm systems. These devices typically use a simple digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying&quot;&gt;amplitude shift keying&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying&quot;&gt;frequency shift keying&lt;/a&gt; modulation. The higher frequency ISM allocation is from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, which spans 100 MHz and is available worldwide. This allocation is frequently used by high data rate systems, like WiFi or Bluetooth, with more sophisticated digital modulations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying&quot;&gt;8PSK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&quot;&gt;OFDM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum&quot;&gt;direct-sequence spread spectrum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur radio has several allocations on the UHF band, the most common of which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70-centimeter_band&quot;&gt;70 centimeter band&lt;/a&gt; from ~420 to ~450 MHz. Like the 2 meter band on VHF, the 70 centimeter band is also commonly used for voice communications, supported by local &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater&quot;&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt; that receive and rebroadcast transmissions from a high elevation for extended reception, and used for amateur satellite uplink. The UHF band also includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-centimeter_band&quot;&gt;23 centimeter band&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13-centimeter_band&quot;&gt;13 centimeter band&lt;/a&gt; allocations for amateur radio, which might be used for experimental purposes or for amateur radio satellite uplinks. Amateur radio operation on UHF is typically ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated audio, but can also be ~3 kHz wide single-sideband modulated audio, or even continuous wave for morse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UHF band has several &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service&quot;&gt;personal radio service&lt;/a&gt; allocations for unlicensed two-way communications by individuals and businesses. For example, certain regions have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_CB&quot;&gt;UHF Citizen Band&lt;/a&gt; allocation from ~476 to ~478 MHz, similar to the HF Citizen Band. Much of the EU has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMR446&quot;&gt;PMR446&lt;/a&gt; allocation from ~446.0 to ~446.2 MHz, with channels set aside for analog ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated audio, as well as the digital ~6.25 kHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_private_mobile_radio&quot;&gt;dPMR446&lt;/a&gt; and ~12.5 kHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio#DMR_Tier_I&quot;&gt;DMR&lt;/a&gt; protocols. The US and some other countries in the Americas, have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service&quot;&gt;Family Radio Service&lt;/a&gt; (FRS) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mobile_Radio_Service&quot;&gt;General Mobile Radio Service&lt;/a&gt; (GMRS) in the ~462 to ~467 MHz range. GMRS requires a license to operate in the United States. FRS and GMRS use analog ~10 kHz wide frequency modulated audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aircraft use a position reporting system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast&quot;&gt;ADS-B&lt;/a&gt; which is centered at 1090 MHz (for “Mode-S” transmissions) in the UHF band. The 1090 MHz Mode-S transmissions use a 50 kHz wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-position_modulation&quot;&gt;pulse position modulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable allocations in the UHF band include those for satellite communications. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS&quot;&gt;GLONASS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)&quot;&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt; all use allocations inside of the 1 to 2 GHz range for their downlink, at carrier frequencies around 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6 GHz. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_Communications&quot;&gt;Iridium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmarsat&quot;&gt;Inmarsat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalstar&quot;&gt;Globalstar&lt;/a&gt; satellite telecommunication services operate uplink and downlink in several bands allocated across the 1.5 to 1.7 GHz range. Satellite radio services, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Holdings&quot;&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/a&gt;, have a 2310 to 2360 MHz allocation for downlink in North America. These systems all use digital modulations and custom protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;shf-and-beyond&quot;&gt;SHF and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-shf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for SHF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_high_frequency&quot;&gt;super high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (SHF) spans from 3 GHz to 30 GHz. Signals on SHF propagate by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation&quot;&gt;line of sight propagation&lt;/a&gt;, like in UHF and VHF, but due to their small wavelengths, SHF radio waves may also be focused by reasonably sized highly directional antennas, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna&quot;&gt;parabolic antennas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHF has two &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&quot;&gt;Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band&lt;/a&gt; allocations from 5.725 to 5.875 GHz and 24 to 24.25 GHz. The 5.8 GHz is commonly known for its use in the Wi-Fi 802.11a, 802.11n, and 802.11ac protocols. These protocols either use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing&quot;&gt;OFDM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO-OFDM&quot;&gt;MIMO-OFDM&lt;/a&gt; digital modulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amateur radio has several allocations on the SHF band, including the 9, 5, 3, and 1.2 centimeter bands. These bands are well suited for amateur radio satellite communication, as well as experimental point-to-point communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the achievable high directivity and large spectral bandwidth available, SHF is commonly used in point-to-point links for terrestrial and space communications. For terrestrial communications, these are often used in telecommunications backhaul, linking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station&quot;&gt;base stations&lt;/a&gt; to their network. For satellite communications, the SHF band subsumes the more common IEEE band names &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_band&quot;&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band&quot;&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_band&quot;&gt;Ku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_band&quot;&gt;K&lt;/a&gt;, and half of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka_band&quot;&gt;Ka&lt;/a&gt;, many of which have allocations dedicated to satellite communication and satellite television broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/us-ntia-spectrum-ehf-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Snapshot of U.S. Spectrum Allocation for EHF&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency&quot;&gt;extremely high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (EHF) spans from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Signals on EHF propagate by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation&quot;&gt;line of sight propagation&lt;/a&gt; as well, but the higher frequencies have limited range due to atmospheric absorbance by water and oxygen molecules. EHF signals are sensitive to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_fade&quot;&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EHF band is used for high data rate, short terrestrial point-to-point links, as well as some satellite communications up to about 50 GHz. The atmosphere absorbs most EHF frequencies above this, rendering it unusable for satellite communication — see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_window&quot;&gt;radio window&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance&quot;&gt;802.11ad&lt;/a&gt; protocol is designed to operate around 60 GHz for local high data rate wireless communication. Otherwise, much of the EHF band is undeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high data rate, and consequently wide bandwidth, signals on SHF and EHF are not easy to receive, process, or transmit with off-the-shelf SDR transceivers, as their bandwidth is limited to up to about 60 MHz. In general, SDR technology lags behind that of conventional hardware with respect to bandwidth, due to limited efficiency of analog to digital conversion technology at very high sample rates, and the computational burden very high sample rates impose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation&quot;&gt;tremendously high frequency band&lt;/a&gt; (THF) spans from 300 GHz to 3 THz. Signals on THF propagate by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_high_frequency&quot;&gt;line of sight propagation&lt;/a&gt;. Technology to radiate and modulate THF radio waves is still in the research phase, but this band will probably be limited in application to close range high bandwidth point-to-point links (at least on Earth), like much of the EHF band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;amateur-radio&quot;&gt;Amateur Radio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to further develop radio fundamentals is to become an amateur radio operator. Amateur radio is the hobby of making radio contacts, experimenting with radio hardware and antennas, and for some, providing backup communications in case of an emergency that compromises local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portions throughout the RF spectrum have been set aside by international agreements expressly for amateur radio use. An amateur radio license grants the privilege to transmit on these spectrum allocations, often with unrestricted choice of modulation and protocol, and at high power (e.g. up to 1.5 kilowatts on many bands in the United States). Without an amateur radio license, legal radio transmissions with unlicensed hardware are limited to relatively low power on the crowded &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band&quot;&gt;ISM bands&lt;/a&gt;. A map of the US amateur radio allocations is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum dedicated to amateur radio would be worth billions if it were sold for private ownership, so it’s a delicate blessing that politics have favored this culture in telecommunications history. As it stands today, transmitting with a radio is not protected under a right like free speech, but is a licensed privilege regulated by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating amateur radio helps to develop an intuition for real world signals, like the bandwidth of various analog and digital modulations, the propagation of different radio frequency bands, and the logistics of operating a legal transmitter. It also revisits some recurring themes in technology, like the trade-offs between analog vs. digital systems, proprietary vs. open standards, and centralized (VHF/UHF repeaters) vs. decentralized (HF) networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-a-license&quot;&gt;Getting a License&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, amateur radio licenses come in three levels: Technician Class, General Class, and Amateur Extra Class. The Technician license grants transmit privileges on all amateur radio bands above 30 MHz, whereas the higher license levels grant transmit privileges on progressively more spectrum in the lower frequency HF band. The Technician license can be obtained by scoring 75% or better on a 35 question multiple choice exam, and costs about $15 to take. These tests are not difficult to pass, as the question and answer pools for each level are published in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying for the amateur radio license is a great way to learn basic concepts about modulations, propagation, antennas, and international spectrum laws. This is the six-step plan I followed to getting a license and on the air in about 1.5 weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a local exam session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arrl.org/find-an-amateur-radio-license-exam-session&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Track-Technician-Class-Radio-License/dp/1720317992/&quot;&gt;The Fast Track To Your Technician Class Ham Radio License&lt;/a&gt; book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice flash cards on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hamstudy.org/&quot;&gt;HamStudy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hamexam.org/&quot;&gt;HamExam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take and pass the exam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until your call sign appears in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp&quot;&gt;FCC database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your first contact on a local VHF or UHF repeater with a Baofeng &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A/&quot;&gt;UV-5R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amateur radio culture in the United States is a peculiar mix of radio geeks, electronics tinkerers, and preppers. Some enjoy it simply for casual conversation with like-minded radio enthusiasts on their commute to or from work. Others are in it purely for the decentralized, self-sufficient means of communications it enables, perhaps for survival preparedness or for volunteering for emergency communications. And many hams tinker with antennas, low power transceivers, installing repeaters, or even building dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_shack&quot;&gt;ham shacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hams were some of the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture&quot;&gt;“makers”&lt;/a&gt; of their time, and though on bad days may share their hand-wavy engineering, they also have a history of publishing academic-esque articles on subjects like propagation, circuits, and antenna design. Amateur radio is also increasingly intersecting with the modern “hacker” culture, leading to more amateur radio related presentations, hosted license exam sessions, or the establishment of a regular &lt;a href=&quot;https://conham.org/&quot;&gt;contact frequency on VHF&lt;/a&gt; at security conferences like &lt;a href=&quot;https://defcon.org/&quot;&gt;DEF CON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The privileges granted by amateur radio also raises some interesting political questions, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the FCC’s authority justified by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should there be more diverse unlicensed “public parks” on the radio spectrum, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio&quot;&gt;Citizens Band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service&quot;&gt;Family Radio Service&lt;/a&gt;, but for audio broadcasting or for digital transmissions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does radio contrast to other communication methods that are protected by free speech?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;antennas-1&quot;&gt;Antennas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as antennas go, the sky is the limit. This is true in all respects: design, price, size, and elevation. Optimized antennas exist for just about every radio frequency band and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great starting point for exploring SDR is a pair of wideband antennas: one that covers the lower frequency LF, MF, and HF bands, and one that covers the lower bulk of the higher frequency VHF and UHF bands. An easy way to achieve this combination is with a long-wire antenna for the lower bands, and a discone antenna for the higher bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_wire_antenna&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/long-wire-antenna-thumb.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Long-wire antenna

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_wire_antenna&quot;&gt;long-wire antenna&lt;/a&gt; is what it sounds like — a long wire, strung up at high elevation. These antennas are effective basic antennas for receiving and transmitting across the HF band. They are better when paired with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vk6ysf.com/unun_9-1.htm&quot;&gt;9:1 unun&lt;/a&gt; impedance transformer, to help match the relatively large &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)#Impedance_matching&quot;&gt;antenna impedance&lt;/a&gt; to the lower 75 ohm impedance of the RTL-SDR, or to the 50 ohm impedance of most other receivers and transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/discone-antenna-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Discone antenna

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discone_antenna&quot;&gt;discone antenna&lt;/a&gt; is an omnidirectional antenna that looks like a disc on a cone. It has approximately 10:1 bandwidth, relative to the center frequency. which makes it a good choice for the VHF and UHF bands as a receiving antenna. A discone antenna with a center frequency of 50, 75 or 100 MHz is reasonably sized, and can be constructed with materials from your local hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For receiving and transmitting on the 2m and 70cm amateur radio bands on VHF or UHF, an inexpensive option is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.n9tax.com/slim%20jim%20info.html&quot;&gt;roll-up J-pole&lt;/a&gt;, which can be bought assembled for about $25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some applications require specific antennas for effective reception or transmission, because of properties like long wave length, polarization, or directionality. For example, receiving a VLF time station benefits from a resonant magnetic loop antenna, which is substantially smaller in size than its equivalently performing dipole or monopole electric field antenna. Receiving circularly polarized radio waves from satellites, e.g. a weather satellite, benefit from a circularly polarized antenna, like a quadrifilar helix antenna. Receiving the ISS, as it orbits the Earth at a certain elevation, is a lot easier with a directional Yagi antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain situations, like electrically noisy apartment buildings or the lack of outdoor access, may also call for alternate antennas designs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna&quot;&gt;magnetic loop antennas&lt;/a&gt;, which can produce better results indoors than an electric field antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rf-upconverter&quot;&gt;RF Upconverter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to receive the lower frequency LF, MF, and HF bands on the RTL-SDR, they must be translated into the tuning range of the RTL-SDR. This can be done with the help of an inline RF device called an upconverter, which translate a range of frequencies up by a constant frequency offset. For example, a 125 MHz upconverter designed for the lower frequency bands will translate signals from 0 to 30 MHz to 125 to 155 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two popular upconverters that can be used with the RTL-SDR and other SDR receivers for the LF, MF, and HF bands are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nooelec.com/store/ham-it-up.html&quot;&gt;NooElec Ham It Up&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://airspy.com/spyverter-r2/&quot;&gt;Airspy Spyverter&lt;/a&gt;. They are available for around $50 to $60 (with a shielded case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nooelec.com/store/ham-it-up.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/nooelec-ham-it-up-thumb.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NooElec Ham It Up &lt;a href=&quot;https://airspy.com/spyverter-r2/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://luaradio.io/images/airspy-spyverter-thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Airspy Spyverter&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appropriate low frequency antenna (e.g. long-wire antenna) and one of these upconverters enable an SDR receiver with a higher tuning range to receive the lower frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hardware-1&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several SDR receivers on the market with better performance and higher sample rates than the RTL-SDR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://airspy.com/airspy-mini/&quot;&gt;Airspy Mini&lt;/a&gt; — 3, 6, or 10 MSPS sample rate, 24 to 1700 MHz tuning range, 12-bit ADC, $99 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/&quot;&gt;Airspy HF+ Discovery&lt;/a&gt; — up to 36 MSPS sample rate, 0.5 kHz to 31 MHz, 60 MHz to 260 MHz tuning range, 18-bit ADC, $169 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1a/&quot;&gt;SDRplay RSP1A&lt;/a&gt; — 2 to 10.66 MSPS sample rate, 1 kHZ to 2000 MHz tuning range, 14-bit ADC, $109 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also many SDR transceivers on the market. Note that transmitting with an SDR with the intent of high power radiation (i.e. not testing locally or with a loopback) requires some additional external hardware, like an RF power amplifier and a transmit bandpass filter. Transmissions should only be made on authorized frequencies, and with a setup that ensures transmit harmonics are thoroughly suppressed, so that they are not unintentionally radiated, otherwise they may interfere with other transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of SDR transceivers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;signal-processing&quot;&gt;Signal Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building software radios or modulation/demodulation utilities out of digital signal processing primitives requires some background in signals and systems, as well as communications, which is beyond the scope of this introduction. Below is a short list of some resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signals and Systems
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communications Systems
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I/Q sampling
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-and-communities&quot;&gt;Resources and Communities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://websdr.org/&quot;&gt;WebSDR&lt;/a&gt; serves a listing of web-hosted SDR receivers. This is a neat way to explore the RF spectrum at other locations, though it is currently limited to audio demodulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtl-sdr.com/&quot;&gt;RTL-SDR blog&lt;/a&gt; actively aggregates SDR news and RTL-SDR projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/&quot;&gt;Hackaday&lt;/a&gt; often features amateur radio and SDR related projects and articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sigidwiki.com/&quot;&gt;Signal Identification Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is a wiki for crowdsourced radio signal identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit hosts several active radio and SDR related communities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net/&quot;&gt;freenode&lt;/a&gt; IRC network has the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;##rtlsdr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;##hamradio&lt;/code&gt; channels, as well as dedicated channels for various SDR hardware (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#airspy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#bladerf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#hackrf&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The sad state of personal data and infrastructure</title>
<link>https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want all these inconveniences somehow solved, but I live in real world and that's not gonna magically happen. So let me be more specific: I argue that one &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; reason these tools and integration I want don't exist is that people don't have easy uniform access to their data in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Easy&quot; is used here in two senses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy for humans&lt;/strong&gt; to look at and browse through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bit is hard in practice as (typically) the more something machine friendly the less it's human friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy for programmers&lt;/strong&gt; to manipulate, analyze and interact with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's concentrate on this part for now. If this is solved, it automatically enables programmers to develop human-friendly tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how would 'easy access to data' look in ideal world? Let me present you my speculations on it, and I would be happy to hear your opinions on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want &lt;strong&gt;an API&lt;/strong&gt; that I can query and get any of my personal data. In ideal world it wouldn't really matter where the data is and it could be a web API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, realistically, as of today, easiest way to quickly access your data and more importantly, play with it, is when it's &lt;strong&gt;already on your filesystem&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;before-aside&quot;&gt;Whether it's plaintext, sqlite or some sort of binary data – doesn't matter, already having it locally saves you from the whole class of problems (which I'm about to pinpoint in the following section).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;even better if it's already in your RAM and interpreter, but that's a bit too much to wish at this point.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably noticed, it's almost never the case that you have your personal data locally at hand. You need to spend extra effort to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Officially Announces Bug Bounty Program Covering All of Its Software</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/20/apple-launches-public-bug-bounty-program/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/20/apple-launches-public-bug-bounty-program/</guid>
<description>Apple today officially opened its bug bounty program to all security researchers, after the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/08/apple-bug-bounty-program-improvements/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the expansion plan at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas earlier this year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/apple-bug-bounty-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1077&quot; height=&quot;485&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-722873&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to now, Apple's bug bounty program was invitation-based and non-iOS devices were not included. As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-opens-public-bug-bounty-program-publishes-official-rules/&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, from today any security researcher who locates bugs in iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/icloud/&quot;&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt; will be eligible to receive a cash payout for disclosing the vulnerability to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has also increased the maximum size of the bounty from $200,000 per exploit to $1 million depending on the nature of the security flaw. A zero-click kernel code execution with persistence will earn the maximum amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple says it will add a 50 percent bonus on top of the standard payout for bugs found in beta software, which allows the company to nix the issue before the OS version goes public. It is also offering the same bonus for so-called &quot;regression bugs&quot; – these are bugs that Apple has patched in the past but which have been accidentally reintroduced in a later version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/&quot;&gt;published more information on its website&lt;/a&gt; detailing the bug bounty program's rules, as well as a full breakdown of the rewards being offered to researchers based on the exploits they uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When submitting reports, researchers must include a detailed description of the issue, an explanation of the state of the system when the exploit works, and enough information for Apple to reliably reproduce the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, Apple plans to provide vetted and trusted security researchers and hackers with &quot;dev&quot; iPhones, or special iPhones that provide deeper access to the underlying software and operating system that will make it easier for vulnerabilities to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These iPhones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/06/apple-special-iphones-bug-testing/&quot;&gt;being provided&lt;/a&gt; as part of Apple's forthcoming iOS Security Research Device Program, which aims to encourage additional security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities, ultimately leading to more secure devices for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In April 1997&lt;/b&gt;, Wired magazine published &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/1997/04/netizen-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a feature&lt;/a&gt; with the grand and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/02/08/383279630/100-years-later-whats-the-legacy-of-birth-of-a-nation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regrettable&lt;/a&gt; title “Birth of a Digital Nation.” It was a good time to make sweeping, sunny pronouncements about the future of the United States and technology. The US stood alone astride the globe. Its stock market was booming. Microsoft was about to become the world’s most valuable company, a first for a tech firm. A computer built by IBM was about to beat the world chess champion at his own game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, the journalist Jon Katz argued, the country was on the verge of something even greater than prosperity and progress — something that would change the course of world history. Led by the Digital Nation, “a new social class” of “young, educated, affluent” urbanites whose “business, social and cultural lives increasingly revolve around” the internet, a revolution was at hand, which would produce unprecedented levels of civic engagement and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools of this revolution were facts, with which the Digital Nation was obsessed, and with which they would destroy — or at least neuter — partisan politics, which were boring and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw … the formation of a new postpolitical philosophy,” Katz wrote. “This nascent ideology, fuzzy and difficult to define, suggests a blend of some of the best values rescued from the tired old dogmas — the humanism of liberalism, the economic opportunity of conservatism, plus a strong sense of personal responsibility and a passion for freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the coming changes to the Enlightenment, Katz lauded an “interactivity” that “could bring a new kind of community, new ways of holding political conversations” — “a media and political culture in which people could amass factual material, voice their perspectives, confront other points of view, and discuss issues in a rational way.” Such a sensible, iterative American public life contained, Katz wrote, “the … tantalizing … possibility that technology could fuse with politics to create a more civil society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such arguments, that a rational tech vanguard would spark an emancipatory cycle of national participation, were common at the time. (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/californian-ideology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Though they were not unchallenged&lt;/a&gt;.) Katz’s is notable for its relative restraint. “The Long Boom,” an infamous piece published in Wired just three months later, predicted the spread of digital networks “to every corner of the planet” leading to “the great cross-fertilization of ideas, the ongoing, never-ending planetary conversation” that would culminate, by 2020, in “a civilization of civilizations” that would set foot on Mars in species-wide harmony. (Instead, we got Baby Yoda.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evangelism had a profound influence on the next 20 years of laissez-faire policy toward and positive public opinion about the digitization of American life. A deeply felt, mostly unexamined, sense that tech would lead to a freer and more convenient existence was the midwife of our digital present. It allowed the creator of a website to rate the attractiveness of Harvard’s women students to build an advertising platform with $55 billion in annual revenue. It allowed an online shop created to sell books to build a $25.7 billion cloud computing network. It allowed a company that started as a way for rich people to summon private drivers to turn itself into $47 billion, well, whatever the hell Uber is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though challenged at the edges, this sense lingered. As late as 2012, even as the vast platforms that now control the internet had assumed their current shapes, the bestselling author Steven Johnson argued the glass was half full in his book &lt;i&gt;Future&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perfect&lt;/i&gt; — that “peer progressives,” enlightened digital natives, would end entrenched social and political problems through crowdsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back from the shaky edge of a new decade, it’s clear that the past 10 years saw many Americans snap out of this dream, shaken awake by a brutal series of shocks and dislocations from the very changes that were supposed to &quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;.” When they opened their eyes, they did indeed see that the Digital Nation had been born. Only it hadn’t set them free. They were being ruled by it. It hadn’t tamed politics. It sent them berserk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it hadn’t brought people closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had alienated them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The longest-running&lt;/b&gt; measure of alienation in American life is the Harris Poll’s Alienation Index, which has been calculated annually for more than 50 years. It’s a simple survey that asks whether respondents agree with these five statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What you think doesn’t count very much anymore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most people with power try to take advantage of people like yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The people running the country don’t really care what happens to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’re left out of things going on around you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris then averages the rates of agreement to reach an index, which is a rough proxy for how included Americans feel in their country and their communities. In 1998, a year after the “Birth of a Digital Nation,” was published, the score was 56%. In 2008, as the platforms became dominant, it was 58%. Last year, it was 69%, the highest it’s ever been. (The lowest level, 29%, came in the Alienation Index’s first year, 1966, the same year HP began selling the 2116A — its first computer.) It’s easy to speculate about the reasons for this increase: a financial crisis that awakened Americans to the widening gaps between rich and poor; an opioid epidemic caused by corporate greed; entrenched racism and sexism; bitterly divided partisan politics; and, of course, technological change — the prism through which Americans view all of these things, and the vector that brings Americans’ feelings about all of these things together into the same few spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent six years reporting on deeply alienated people on the internet, during which time I’ve come to see conditions of disconnection and frustration everywhere the Digital Nation touches: on social media, in search algorithms, in the digital economy. In myself. The feelings of powerlessness, estrangement, loneliness, and anger created or exacerbated by the information age are so general it can be easy to think they are just a state of nature, like an ache that persists until you forget it’s there. But then sometimes it suddenly gets much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much worse: The Americans who marked this decade most visibly with their anger and impotence are, of course, young white men. In the summer of 2014, I first reported on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/the-man-who-sparked-gamergate-regrets-the-harassment-but-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the jilted 24-year-old&lt;/a&gt; who started an unlikely social movement with a seething blog post about the behavior of his ex-girlfriend, an obscure game developer. Gamergate! It was so stupid and about nothing and quickly became so scary and about everything. An &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/in-2015-the-dark-forces-of-the-internet-became-a-countercult&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entire culture of alienated posters and clever scammers&lt;/a&gt; cohered around it, around the impulse that something needed to be protected and some people needed to be attacked. &lt;i&gt;What you think doesn’t count very much anymore.&lt;/i&gt; Some of these young men were trolls, others neo-Nazis. Some got &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/adult-swim-cancels-alt-right-show-million-dollar-extreme&quot;&gt;TV shows&lt;/a&gt;. Some got &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/leaked-documents-suggest-secretive-billionaire-trump-donors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paid out by billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made it to the White House&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/lane-davis-ralph-retort-seattle4truth-alt-right&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wanted media careers&lt;/a&gt;. A few stewed for so long in their own resentment and the deeply sad world they created that they &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/does-hateful-speech-lead-to-violence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;broke with reality&lt;/a&gt;. Several killed. One committed &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahryan/this-is-one-of-new-zealands-darkest-days-jacinda-ardern-has&quot;&gt;one of the most horrifying crimes&lt;/a&gt; of the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many more made threats, one of the defining features of life online in the 2010s. All things considered, we barely heard from the people who received them — a failure I was a part of. Try to imagine every woman and every nonwhite, non-Christian and LGBTQ human who has been threatened with death, torture, rape, or worse, on a major social platform. Add up all of those feelings of anger and powerlessness, against the backdrop of a $24 billion company that &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/a-honeypot-for-assholes-inside-twitters-10-year-failure-to-s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wouldn’t take it seriously for the longest time&lt;/a&gt;. There is no legal recourse — only participation in a public system that abuses its users. &lt;i&gt;What you think doesn’t count very much anymore.&lt;/i&gt; People say: “Ignore it. No one dies from internet harassment.” Or else: “I’m so sorry for what you’re going through,” like it’s a divorce or a death in the family. Both are alienating, and I write from experience. Sometimes, for reporting, I received messages over Twitter and Facebook containing images of my father, who is dead, superimposed in a gas chamber. The joke is that he was Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is we don’t have the right language yet to talk about an entirely new constellation of alarming and negative interactions, from threats to dogpiles to friend requests that go unanswered for a bit too long to yes, sorry, cancellations. They’re both more and less serious than we can manage to express with words, and the gap between that and what they feel like is an alienation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts might call the pictures of my father pollution in my information ecosystem. This is the best metaphor available as of 2019 for media that is bad for us. What, then, is a pristine information ecosystem? What is an information Superfund site? How do you do toxic information cleanup on, say, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/baraboo-nazi-prom-photo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a town that has been poisoned by the internet&lt;/a&gt;? For that matter, how do we even agree on what’s toxic? Every attempt to name the problem with bad information on the internet runs into the “fake news” dilemma: Anyone can use this metaphor at scale, including and especially people who have a vested interest in keeping things extremely toxic. The sense that shared language is impossible: an alienation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when we get “good” information online, we can’t always be sure where it’s coming from and why we’re seeing it when we’re seeing it. A profit-driven information apparatus uses &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/06/social-media-networks-fake-accounts-report-076939&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a huge and growing&lt;/a&gt; fake user base to juice the statistics it shows to advertisers. The incentive is not to show you true things, but to be able to claim as many people as possible are seeing something, anything. To be no different to the men with the money than a bot, that’s an alienation. To not know where the things you read and see come from, nor that they’re real, that’s an alienation. To labor to pick out true from false, and know that many Americans don’t bother to do the same, that’s an alienation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people who thrive in this world, of course: certain kinds of strivers, grifters, presidents. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/andy-ngo-portland-antifa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;People who are very tendentious and very persistent&lt;/a&gt;. I reported a story this year about two young scammers who’d spent their whole lives online, honing their skills. They &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/tomi-masters-down-the-rabbit-hole-i-go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fabricated an entire world&lt;/a&gt; on social media with nothing more than time and used it to lead a young woman to her death. Were they the exception or the example? I couldn’t tell. Seeing people like this get their way over, and over, and over: That’s an alienation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big social media platforms are trying very hard to address the problem of toxic information, they tell us. But the algorithms that they tweak — I personally always imagine an old Swiss watchmaker squinting through a loupe — are top secret stuff. Secret corporate formulas encourage conspiratorial thinking. &lt;i&gt;You’re left out of things going on around you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creators, who depend on these algorithms for money, are thus alienated, as are the people who consume their creations, which are frequently conspiratorial. And the creators are the (relatively) privileged ones! Each major social network is a brutal hierarchy. The people who ascend tend to be teeth-grindingly obsessed with what works and what doesn’t. The people who don’t suspect the risen have achieved their status through a series of inauthentic poses. Or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/05/youth-unhappiness-uk-doubles-in-past-10-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they feel grossly inadequate&lt;/a&gt;. Either response is alienating. &lt;i&gt;What you think doesn’t count very much anymore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics play out in a desperate theater of social media optimization that my colleague Anne Helen Peterson &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so memorably described&lt;/a&gt; in her viral story about millennial burnout. It’s almost always unpaid work, the product of which doesn’t belong to the person who makes it. To be alienated from one’s labor — &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/subject/alienation/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that rings a bell&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the new economy of freelancers and gig workers, precarious, unprotected, and connected. Hourly workers &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fry their brains with images no one should ever see&lt;/a&gt; — information detoxification — working to meet &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebook-moderators-are-set-up-to-fail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bizarre and inconsistent standards&lt;/a&gt; handed down from a distant authority, and then melt down in filthy bathrooms. Harried subcontracted delivery drivers feel so desperate to meet overnight shipping deadlines they &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-next-day-delivery-deaths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;get in deadly crashes&lt;/a&gt;. Uber drivers, some of whom &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/07/the-uber-drivers-forced-to-sleep-in-parking-lots-to-make-a-decent-living&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sleep in parking lots&lt;/a&gt;, have &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/05/uber-office-bathrooms-segregated/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;separate bathrooms&lt;/a&gt; than Uber corporate staff. These people, it stands to reason, might be alienated. &lt;i&gt;The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the median home price is San Francisco is $1.4 million. This is where the Digital Nation mostly lives, in the most beautiful place in the country, profiting directly or indirectly off our participation in the alienating world they’ve built. Many of these people &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/sunday-review/human-contact-luxury-screens.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;don’t want their children&lt;/a&gt; using the products and networks they build and sell. &lt;i&gt;The people running the country don’t really care what happens to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, they’ll &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-12-11/silicon-valley-got-millions-to-let-siri-and-alexa-listen-in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listen to you&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjw9e8/inside-rings-quest-to-become-law-enforcements-best-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spy on you for law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll use that data, which they may or may not protect, to get richer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Near the end&lt;/b&gt; of “Birth of a Digital Nation,” Jon Katz acknowledged that the new digital elite would have one natural division from the country they were bound to inherit: class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The digital world is often disconnected from many of the world's problems by virtue of its members' affluence and social standing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membership in the digital nation as it exists today is a kind of class identity, of course. As Katz rightly predicted, its members’ “business, social and cultural lives increasingly revolve around” the internet. The luckiest of this group, high on meritocratic myths, have founded or found lucrative jobs with a handful of tech firms. The rest of us enrich them by using their platforms and their services. This is surely not the kind of participation Katz had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his credit, Katz understood the harms that lead to alienation. “Alienation online — and perhaps offline as well — is not ingrained,” he wrote. “It comes from a reflexive assumption that powerful political and media institutions don't care, won't listen, and will not respond.” He just couldn’t conceive of a digital world that made them worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the most alienating fact about the Digital Nation we live in: It incentivizes forms of engagement that make Americans feel less empowered and more alone than ever, to the benefit of very few. It seizes some of the best, noblest human instincts — to share, to know, to connect, to belong — and harnesses them to a degrading system of profit. Anesthetization to these conditions is dangerous. Cynicism and powerlessness are the hallmarks of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/us-china-internet-soft-power-social-setworks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another form of digital life&lt;/a&gt;, an authoritarian one Americans should badly want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder, as the US stumbles into a new decade, what kind of groups and communities we’ll form to deal with these feelings of alienation. Alienated people are especially vulnerable to the destructive forms of belonging promised by nationalism and racism. We know where those lead. Among those who can afford it, people may simply &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-premium.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pay their way&lt;/a&gt; into less alienating online experiences. One thing that gives me a small amount of hope is the recent wave of tech worker organizing. Whatever becomes of it, it’s heartening to witness a group of people who are part of this alienating system attempt to build a movement around solidarity and direct action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe we’ll relearn, as the writer and artist Jenny Odell suggests, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/books/review/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to do nothing&lt;/a&gt;, its own form of action. That’s an American tradition, too. ●&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Xor Filters: Faster and Smaller Than Bloom Filters</title>
<link>https://lemire.me/blog/2019/12/19/xor-filters-faster-and-smaller-than-bloom-filters/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lemire.me/blog/2019/12/19/xor-filters-faster-and-smaller-than-bloom-filters/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In software, you frequently need to check whether some objects is in a set. For example, you might have a list of forbidden Web addresses. As someone enters a new Web address, you may want to check whether it is part of your black list. Or maybe you have a large list of already used passwords and you want to check whether the proposed new password is part of this list of compromised passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard way to solve this problem is to create some key-value data structure. If you have enough memory, you might create a hash table. Or you might use a good old database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such approaches might use too much memory or be too slow. So you want to use a small data structure that can quickly filter the requests. For example, what if you had a tiny data structure that could reliably tell you that either your password is not in the list of compromised password for sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to implement such a filter would be to compute a hash value of all your objects. A hash value is a random-looking number that you generate from your object, in such a way that the same object always generate the same random-looking number, but such that other objects are likely to generate other numbers. So the password “Toronto” might map to the hash value 32. You can then store these small numbers into a key-value store, like a hash table. Hence, you do not need to store all of the objects. For example, you might store 32-bit numbers for each possible password. If you give me a potential password, I check whether its corresponding 32-bit value is in the list and if it is not, then I tell you that it is safe. So if you give me “Toronto”, I check whether 32 is in my table. Otherwise, I send your request to a larger database, for a full lookup. The probability that I send you in vain for a full lookup is called the “false positive probability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this hash table approach might be practical, you could end up using 4 bytes per value. Maybe this is too much? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter&quot;&gt;Bloom filters&lt;/a&gt; come to the rescue. A Bloom filter works similarly, except that you compute several hash values from your object. You use these hash values as indexes inside an array of bits. When adding an object to the set, you set all bits corresponding to the objects to one. When you receive a new object and you want to check whether it belongs to the set, you can just check whether all of the bits have been set. In practice, you will use far fewer than 4 bytes per value (say 12 bits) and still be able to achieve a false positive rate of less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Bloom filter is a textbook algorithm, it has some significant downsides. A major one is that it needs many data accesses and many hash values to check that an object is part of the set. In short, it is not optimally fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you do better? Yes. Among other alternatives, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter&quot;&gt;Fan et al. introduced Cuckoo filters which use less space and are faster than Bloom filters&lt;/a&gt;. While implementing a Bloom filter is a relatively simple exercise, Cuckoo filters require a bit more engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we do even better while limiting the code to something you can hold in your head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you can with xor filters. We just published a paper called &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08258&quot;&gt;Xor Filters: Faster and Smaller Than Bloom and Cuckoo Filters&lt;/a&gt; that will appear in the Journal of Experimental Algorithmics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following figure gives the number of bits per entry versus the false positive probability. Xor filters offer better accuracy for a given memory budget. With only 9 bits per entry, you can get a false positive probability much less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-18114&quot; src=&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1442&quot; height=&quot;1282&quot; srcset=&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison.png 1442w, https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison-300x267.png 300w, https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison-1024x910.png 1024w, https://lemire.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/comparison-768x683.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1442px) 100vw, 1442px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FastFilter/xorfilter/blob/master/xorfilter.go&quot;&gt;The complete implementation in Go fits in less than 300 lines&lt;/a&gt; and I did not even try to be short. In fact, any semi-competent Go coder can make it fit within 200 lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FastFilter/xor_singleheader&quot;&gt;We also have an optimized C version that can be easily integrated into your projects since it is a single-header&lt;/a&gt;. It is larger than 300 lines, but contains different alternatives including an approach with slightly faster construction. I wrote a small demonstration in C with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FastFilter/FilterPassword&quot;&gt;a compromised password detection problem&lt;/a&gt;. The xor filters takes a bit longer to build, but once built, it uses less memory and is about 25% faster in some demonstration test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FastFilter/fastfilter_java&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FastFilter/fastfilter_cpp&quot;&gt;C++ implementations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be relatively easy to start from the Go version and produce a Rust version, but I had to stop somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An xor filter is meant to be immutable. You build it once, and simply rebuild it when needed. Though you can update a Bloom filter, by adding keys to it, it means either overallocating the initial filter, or sacrificing accuracy. These filters are typically not meant to be used as dynamic data structure (unlike a hash table) since they have a fixed capacity, but they are frequently used in a concurrent setting, with multiple threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deletions are generally unsafe with these filters even in principle because they track hash values and cannot deal with collisions without access to the object data: if you have two objects mapping to the same hash value, and you have a filter on hash values, it is going to be difficult to delete one without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of the xor filter requires several bytes of temporary memory per entry, but this memory can be released immediately after construction and a compact data structure remains, using just a few bits per entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit&lt;/strong&gt;: This is joint work with Thomas Mueller Graf. Xor filters are basically an efficient implementation and specialization of a theoretical construction, the Bloomier filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This Page is Designed to Last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeffhuang.com&quot;&gt;Jeff Huang&lt;/a&gt; on 2019-12-19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a professor, the end of the year is an opportunity to clean up and reset for the upcoming new semester. I found myself clearing out old bookmarks—yes, bookmarks: that formerly beloved browser feature that seems to have lost the battle to 'address bar autocomplete'. But this nostalgic act of tidying led me to despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmark after bookmark led to dead link after dead link. Vanished are amazing pieces of writing on kuro5hin about tech culture, and a collection of mathematical puzzles and their associated discussion by academics that my father introduced me to; gone are Woodman's Reverse Engineering tutorials from my high school years, where I first tasted the feeling of dominance over software; even my most recent bookmark, a series of posts on Google+ exposing usb-c chargers' non-compliance with the specification, disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than just link rot, it's the increasing complexity of keeping alive indie content on the web, leading to a reliance on platforms and time-sorted publication formats (blogs, feeds, tweets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I have also contributed to the problem. A paper I published 7 years ago has an abstract that includes a demo link, which has been taken over by a spammy page with a pumpkin picture on it. Part of that lapse was laziness to avoid having to renew and keep a functioning web application up year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recommended my students to push websites to Heroku, and publish portfolios on Wix. Yet every platform with irreplaceable content dies off some day. Geocities, LiveJournal, what.cd, now Yahoo Groups. One day, Medium, Twitter, and even hosting services like GitHub Pages will be plundered then discarded when they can no longer grow or cannot find a working business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is multi-faceted. First, content takes effort to maintain. The content may need updating to remain relevant, and will eventually have to be rehosted. A lot of content, what used to be the vast majority of content, was put up by individuals. But individuals (maybe you?) lose interest, so one day maybe you just don't want to deal with migrating a website to a new hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a growing set of libraries and frameworks are making the web more sophisticated but also more complex. First came jquery, then bootstrap, npm, angular, grunt, webpack, and more. If you are a web developer who is keeping up with the latest, then that's not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if not, maybe you are an embedded systems programmer or startup CTO or enterprise Java developer or chemistry PhD student, sure you could probably figure out how to set up some web server and toolchain, but will you keep this up year after year, decade after decade? Probably not, and when the next year when you encounter a package dependency problem or figure out how to regenerate your html files, you might just throw your hands up and zip up the files to deal with &quot;later&quot;. Even simple technology stacks like static site generators (e.g., Jekyll) require a workflow and will stop working at some point. You fall into npm dependency hell, and forget the command to package a release. And having a website with multiple html pages is complex; how would you know how each page links to each other? index.html.old, Copy of about.html, index.html (1), nav.html?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and this has been touted by others already (and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://gomakethings.com/the-web-is-not-dying/&quot;&gt;rebutted&lt;/a&gt;), the disappearance of the public web in favor of mobile and web apps, walled gardens (Facebook pages), just-in-time WebSockets loading, and AMP decreases the proportion of the web on the world wide web, which now seems more like a continental web than a &quot;world wide web&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for these problems, what can we do about it? It's not such a simple problem that can be solved in this one article. The Wayback Machine and archive.org helps keep some content around for longer. And sometimes an altruistic individual rehosts the content elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the solution needs to be multi-faceted. How do we make web content that can last and be maintained for at least 10 years? As someone studying human-computer interaction, I naturally think of the stakeholders we aren't supporting. Right now putting up web content is optimized for either the professional web developer (who use the latest frameworks and workflows) or the non-tech savvy user (who use a platform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think we should consider both 1) the casual web content &quot;maintainer&quot;, someone who doesn't constantly stay up to date with the latest web technologies, which means the website needs to have low maintenance needs; 2) and the crawlers who preserve the content and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archivebox.io/&quot;&gt;personal archivers&lt;/a&gt;, the &quot;archiver&quot;, which means the website should be easy to save and interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my proposal is seven unconventional guidelines in how we handle websites designed to be informative, to make them easy to maintain and preserve. The guiding intention is that the maintainer will try to keep the website up for at least 10 years, maybe even 20 or 30 years. These are not controversial views necessarily, but are aspirations that are not mainstream—a manifesto for a long-lasting website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return to vanilla HTML/CSS&lt;/strong&gt; – I think we've reached the point where html/css is more powerful, and nicer to use than ever before. Instead of starting with a giant template filled with .js includes, it's now okay to just write plain HTML from scratch again. CSS Flexbox and Grid, canvas, Selectors, box-shadow, the video element, filter, etc. eliminate a lot of the need for JavaScript libraries. We can avoid jquery and bootstrap, as they are becoming less relevant anyways. The more libraries incorporated into the website, the more fragile it becomes. Skip the polyfills and CSS prefixes, and stick with the CSS attributes that work across all browsers. And frequently validate your HTML; it could save you a headache in the future when you encounter a bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't minimize that HTML&lt;/strong&gt; – minimizing (compressing) your HTML and associated CSS/JS seems like it saves precious bandwidth and all the big companies are doing it. But why not? Well, you don't save much because your web pages should be gzipped before being sent over the network, so preemptively shrinking your content probably doesn't do much to save bandwidth if anything at all. But even if it did save a few bytes (it's just text in the end), you now need to have a build process and to add this to your workflow, so updating a website just became more complex. And it's unfriendly to your users; so many people got their start with HTML by smashing that View Source button, and minimizing your HTML completely prevents this amazing ideal of seeing something cool and learning by seeing what they did. Minimizing HTML does not preserve its educational quality, and what gets archived is only the resulting codejunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefer one page over several&lt;/strong&gt; – several pages are hard to maintain. You can lose track of which pages link to what, and it also leads to some system of page templates to reduce redundancy. How many pages can one person really maintain? Having one file, probably just an index.html, is simple and unforgettable. Make use of that infinite vertical scroll. You never have to dig around your files or grep to see where some content lies. And how should your version control that file? Should you use git? Shove them in an 'old/' folder? Well I like the simple approach of naming old files with the date they are retired, like index.20191213.html. Using the ISO format of the date makes it so that it sorts easily, and there's no confusion between American and European date formats. If I have multiple versions in one day, I would use a style similar to that which is customary in log files, of index.20191213.1.html. A nice side effect is then you can access an older version of the file if you remember the date, without logging into the web host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End all forms of hotlinking&lt;/strong&gt; – this cautionary word seems to have disappeared from internet vocabulary, but it's one of the reasons I've seen a perfectly good website fall apart for no reason. Stop directly including images from other websites, stop &quot;borrowing&quot; stylesheets by just linking to them, and especially stop linking to JavaScript files, even the ones hosted by the original developers. Hotlinking is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/25315/hotlinking-what-is-it-and-why-shouldnt-people-do-it&quot;&gt;usually considered rude&lt;/a&gt; since your visitors use someone else's bandwidth, it makes the user experience slower, you let another website track your users, and worse of all if the location you're linking to changes their folder structure or just goes offline, then the failure cascades to your website as well. Google Analytics is unnecessary; store your own server logs and set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://goaccess.io/&quot;&gt;GoAccess&lt;/a&gt; or cut them up however you like, giving you more detailed statistics. Don't give away your logs to Google for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick with the 13 web safe fonts +2&lt;/strong&gt; – we're focusing on content first, so decorative and unusual typefaces are completely unnecessary. Stick with a small palette and the 13 web-safe fonts. Okay, so maybe you really need a neo-grotesque typeface that's not Arial/Helvetica, or you need a geometric typeface. Then go with what's minimally necessary, like Roboto (for neo-grotesque) and Open Sans (for geometric); they're the two most popular typefaces on Google Fonts so most likely to already be cached on your users' computer. Besides those +2 fonts, your focus should be about delivering the content to the user effectively and making the choice of font to be invisible, rather than stroking your design ego. Even if you use Google Fonts, they don't need to be hotlinked. Download the subset you need and locally serve them from your own folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsessively compress your images&lt;/strong&gt; – faster for your users, less space to archive, and easier to maintain when you don't have to back up a humongous folder. Your images can have the same high quality, but be smaller. &lt;a href=&quot;https://victorzhou.com/blog/minify-svgs/&quot;&gt;Minify your SVGs&lt;/a&gt;, losslessly compress your PNGs, generate JPEGs to exactly fit the width of the image. It's worth spending some time figuring out the most optimal way to compress and &lt;a href=&quot;https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/images-done-right-web-graphics-good-to-the-last-byte-optimization-techniques&quot;&gt;reduce the size of your images&lt;/a&gt; without losing quality. And once &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp&quot;&gt;WebP gains support on Safari&lt;/a&gt;, switch over to that format. Ruthlessly minimize the total size of your website and keep it as small as possible. Every MB can cost someone real money, and in fact, my mobile carrier (Google Fi) charges a cent per MB, so a 25 MB website which is fairly common nowadays, costs a quarter itself, about as much as a newspaper when I was a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate the broken URL risk&lt;/strong&gt; – there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://uptimerobot.com&quot;&gt;monitoring services&lt;/a&gt; that will tell you when your URL is down, preventing you from realizing one day that your homepage hasn't been loading for a month and the search engines have deindexed it. Because 10 years is longer than most hard drives or operating systems are meant to last. But to eliminate the risk of a URL breaking completely, set up a second monitoring service. Because if the first one stops for any reason (they move to a pay model, they shut down, you forget to renew something, etc.) you will still get one notification when your URL is down, then realize the other monitoring service is down because you didn't get the second notification. Remember that we're trying to keep something up for over 10 years (ideally way longer, even 30 years), so a lot of services will shut down during this period, so two monitoring services is the safer way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After doing these things, go ahead and place a bit of text in the footer, &quot;The page was designed to last&quot;, linking to this page explaining what that means. The words promise that the maintainer will do their best to follow the ideas in this manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you protest, this is obviously not for web applications. If you are making an application, then make your web or mobile app with the workflow you need. I don't even know any web applications that have remained similarly functioning over 10 years (except Philip Guo's python tutor, due to his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgbovine.net/python-tutor-ten-years.htm&quot;&gt;minimalist strategy for maintaining it&lt;/a&gt;) so it seems like a lost cause anyway. It's also not for websites maintained by an organization like Wikipedia or Twitter. You do your thing, and the salary for an IT team is probably enough to keep something alive for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's not even that important you strictly follow the 7 &quot;rules&quot;, as they're more of a provocation than strict rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's say some small part of the web starts designing websites to last for content that is meant to last. What happens then? Well, people may prefer to link to them since they have a promise of working in the future. People more generally may be more mindful of making their pages more permanent. And users and archivers both save bandwidth when visiting and storing these pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects are long term, but the achievements are incremental and can be implemented by website owners without being dependent on anyone else or waiting for a network effect. You can do this now for your website, and that already would be a positive outcome. Like using a recycled shopping bag instead of a taking a plastic one, it's a small individual action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is meant to provoke and lead to individual action, not propose a complete solution to the decaying web. It's a small simple step for a complex sociotechnical system. So I'd love to see this happen. I intend to keep this page up for at least 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my Ph.D. students Shaun Wallace, Nediyana Daskalova, Talie Massachi, Alexandra Papoutsaki, my colleagues James Tompkin, Stephen Bach, my teaching assistant Kathleen Chai, and my research assistant Yusuf Karim for feedback on earlier drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
