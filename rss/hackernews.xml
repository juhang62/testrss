&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Uber set &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2019/Uber-Reports-Second-Quarter-2019-Results/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two dubious quarterly records&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday as it reported its results: its largest-ever loss, exceeding $5 billion, and its slowest-ever revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The double whammy immediately renewed questions about the prospects for the company, the world’s biggest ride-hailing business. Uber has been dogged by concerns about sluggish sales and whether it can make money, worries that were compounded by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/uber-ipo-price.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a disappointing initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the second quarter, Uber said it lost $5.2 billion, the largest loss since it began disclosing limited financial data in 2017. A majority of that — about $3.9 billion — was caused by stock-based compensation that Uber paid its employees after its I.P.O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Excluding that one-time expense, Uber lost $1.3 billion, or nearly twice the $878 million that it lost a year earlier. On that same basis and excluding other costs, the company said it expected to lose $3 billion to $3.2 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Revenue grew to $3.1 billion, up 14 percent from a year ago, the slowest quarterly growth rate Uber has ever disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We think that 2019 will be our peak investment year,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said in an interview, noting that he anticipated losses would decline over the next two years. “We want to make sure that the kind of growth we have is healthy growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He said there were positives. Uber’s bookings — the money it gets from rides and deliveries before paying commissions to drivers — rose 31 percent from a year ago. The company also added customers, totaling more than 100 million monthly active riders for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The results continued to cast a shadow over Uber, sending its stock falling in after-hours trading. The company, whose growth once rose like a rocket ship as it upended traditional transportation and barreled into markets around the world, was expected to be valued at about $120 billion at its I.P.O. this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Uber dropped below its $45 offering price on its first day of trading and has only briefly risen above that share price since. Mr. Khosrowshahi has been criticized for the way Uber went public and has faced questions about how he intends to revive growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“What we’re looking for is evidence that the company can reaccelerate revenue growth after the last few quarters,” said Tom White, a senior vice president at the financial firm D.A. Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ride-hailing industry has faced scrutiny in recent months for the way its businesses burn money with no imminent likelihood of profits. Companies must constantly spend freely for incentives to attract passengers and drivers and to fend off competition. Both Uber and its rival Lyft were questioned by investors this year about their business models as they prepared to list on the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lyft has also reported a series of deep losses. This week, it said it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/technology/lyft-earnings-revenue.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;lost $644.2 million&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter, though it added that it expected that amount to abate. Several months earlier, Lyft had also posted a particularly steep loss related to stock-based compensation payouts to its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like many technology start-ups, Uber and Lyft recruited employees with stock options that they said could make the workers wealthy when the companies went public. The costs of that practice have now materialized. Uber said it projected spending $450 million to $500 million on stock-based compensation in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Khosrowshahi has been working to cut costs and shift management. In June, he ousted two top executives: the chief operating officer and the chief marketing officer. Last month, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/technology/uber-job-cuts.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;he laid off a third&lt;/a&gt; of the marketing staff, or about 400 people, which he said during an earnings call was necessary to speed up the team’s decision-making. Three board members have also stepped down since Uber’s I.P.O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The board changes have been led by the company’s chairman, Ron Sugar, Mr. Khosrowshahi said on Thursday. He added that they were part of a natural shift after a public offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is a different Uber,” he said in the interview. Since the I.P.O., “I get to spend more time internally with our employees. What I’m insisting on is excellent execution.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Khosrowshahi said Uber, which had been competing with Lyft by offering heavily discounted rides to lure riders, has seen that price war subside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The competitive environment, which got worse in the second half of last year, is progressively improving now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Although Uber has relaxed its discounts for rides, the food delivery business is still highly competitive and the company plans to invest more aggressively in that area, he said. Uber’s food delivery business, Uber Eats, more than doubled its number of monthly customers in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Uber, which aspires to become an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/technology/uber-amazon-roadshow-ipo.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon-like store&lt;/a&gt; for all forms of transportation, is also investing in the development of autonomous cars, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/technology/uber-train-bus-public-transit.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public transit deals&lt;/a&gt;, the expansion of its bicycle and scooter business, and in its freight delivery platform. The company plans to roll out more options for shared rides, such as its car-pooling and public transit features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The employment status of ride-hailing drivers remains an issue for Uber, which classifies them as independent contractors, saying the work is flexible. The categorization also means that Uber does not need to provide drivers with full-time benefits. Yet regulators in New York have set a minimum wage for ride-hailing drivers and California legislators are considering a bill that could reclassify drivers as employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Khosrowshahi characterized the changes in New York as “malarkey” and said that increased driver wages were passed on to riders, which makes the service unaffordable for lower-income passengers. In California, Uber is negotiating with lawmakers over the proposed legislation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We do believe there can be a win-win scenario here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Description&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disclosure relates generally to sharing content within a social networking system and particularly to moderating content in an online forum within the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networking systems often allow users to provide a comment or some user input to content displayed with the social networking system. For example, users can provide a comment on a photo, a wall posts, a profile post, etc. Additionally, social networking systems typically also permit users to generate pages or forums where users may view content posted on the forum page and provide additional comments. The forums may be about a topic, idea, business, product, etc or may be space for users to communicate with each other. Some forums however may be about sensitive topics or may be geared for particular users, and a page creator or moderator may want to block certain types of comments. For example, a moderator of a content page geared towards adolescents may want to block profane words from appearing on the page. In such an instance, the moderator may have to manually delete comments that include profanity. Additionally, a viewing user may have already been exposed to the profane comments before the moderator is able to delete the comments. Therefore, manually deleting certain comments may not provide an effective solution to moderating content in an online forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some instances, a moderator may limit users who may post comments in an online forum. For example, the moderator may provide that only users belonging to certain social networks within the social networking system may comment on a forum. In such an instance, the moderator may be able to enforce content requirements with respect to comments by hoping that the permitted users will not violate the content requirements or by holding the user accountable outside the social networking system. Similarly, the moderator may also block offending users from commenting on the forum in the future. However, in such scenarios, the forum users may already have been exposed to banned content. Additionally, limiting the number or type of users may limit or inhibit different viewpoints in some forums that may benefit from diverse viewpoints. Therefore, a moderator often must choose between diversity of ideas or inappropriate comments from certain users when creating an online forum for users of a social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described embodiments enable a social networking system to block certain comments made by users in an online forum. An online forum may be characterized as a page on one or more topics wherein users may view content and provide comments. A forum creator or moderator may provide a request to block certain content from being displayed to forum users. Block requests may include, for example, a request to filter profane words, extremely negative, racist or derogatory comments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, the social networking system blocks banned comments by analyzing the text of the comments. For example, if a comment includes a profane word, as provided in list of banned words, the social networking system will not display the comment to other users of the social networking system. Additionally, in one embodiment the social networking system also performs a sentiment analysis to identify whether a comment includes sentiment that is banned by the moderator. Banned sentiments may include for example, racist, derogatory or negative comments. Additionally, the social networking system may train a machine learning classifier to block comments based on moderator actions of manually deleting comments or unblocking comments in the online forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, the blocked comments are not displayed to the forum users. However, the blocked comment may be displayed to the commenting user and his or her friends within the social networking system. As such, the offending user may not be aware that his or her comment is not displayed to other users of the forum. In other instances, should a user be deemed a repeat offender, the forum display may not include the comment input text box to prevent the user from trying to spam the forum. As such, the social networking system may provide an online forum experience that is deemed appropriate by the forum creator or moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 1 illustrates a system for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 2 is a network diagram including a social networking system for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a social networking system for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a process for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DETAILED DESCRIPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A social networking system includes users connected to each other and non-user entities such as businesses, products, bands, songs, games, etc. Users of the social networking system typically have profile pages wherein users may post comments, photos and otherwise communicate with each other. Similarly, the non-user entities may have a page that users can like and post comments, pictures/videos associated with the non-user entity. Users can also create pages for an organization, a concept, an event etc., wherein users can communicate with each other by posting comments and such on the page. These pages provide an online forum for one or more topics associated with the page. Embodiments of the invention permit forum moderators to provide words or sentiments that should not be displayed to users viewing the forum because they may be inappropriate in light of the topic or in light of the intended audience. As such, the social networking system does not display the banned content to users viewing the forum page within the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure (FIG.) 1 illustrates a system for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the system includes a commenting user 102, a content page 104 including social content 106 and an input text box 108, a content moderating engine 110, a viewing user's content page 112 including social content 114 and an input text box 116 and a commenting user's social networking system display 118 includes social content 120, user comment 122 and an input text box 124.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, a content page 104 is provided to a commenting user 102 responsive to a request by the commenting user 102. The content page 104 may be created by a user of the social networking system to highlight or discuss a non-user entity within the social networking system. A non-user entity may be an idea, an activity, a community, an organization, a business, a product etc. The content page includes social content 106 comprising comments, photos or videos or other media shared within the content page 104 by entities within the social networking system. In one embodiment, the content page 104 also includes an input text box 108 that receives a user input. A user may provide a comment to add to the content displayed within the content page 104.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, a commenting user 102 inputs his or her comments in the input text box 108 of the content page to share the comment with users viewing the content page 104. The comment is received by the social networking system and displayed on the content page if the content moderating engine 110 deems that the comment meets requirements provided by the page moderator. A content moderator may provide that use of certain words, such as profanity is prohibited on a content page 104. Additionally, the moderator may provide that use of certain sentiments such as aggressive negativity is also prohibited on the content page 104. The content moderating engine 110 reviews comments to determine if the commenting user's comment includes any of the prohibited words or sentiments. If prohibited content is present in the user's comments, the comment may be blocked by the content moderating engine 110, such that it is not displayed to other users viewing the content page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the content of a user comment is prohibited, a viewing user's content page 112 excludes the comment. Thus, a prohibited content is not displayed to the user. In one embodiment, the social networking system may provide a message notifying a user that a comment was removed because it was deemed inappropriate for the content page 104. With the exception of the removed comment, the user's content page 112 may include other content associated with the content page 104, including social content 114 and an input text box 116. Alternatively, the prohibited content may be displayed on the commenting user's content page 118 along with other social content 120 and an input text box 124. Therefore, the commenting user 102 is not made aware that his or her comment was not displayed to other users viewing the content page 104. If a user does not know that his or her comment was blocked, the user may be less likely to repeatedly post or repost--that is, spam--the content page 104 or attempt to circumvent the content moderating engine's 110 filtering capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System Architecture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a system environment suitable for operation of a social networking system 100. The system environment comprises one or more client devices 210, one or more third-party websites 240, a social networking system 100 comprising a content moderating engine 110 and a network 220. In alternative configurations, different and/or additional modules can be included in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client devices 210 comprise one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via the network 220. For example, the client devices 210 may be desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers (pads), smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities. The client devices 220 are configured to communicate via network 220, which may comprise any combination of local area and/or wide area networks, using both wired and wireless communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a social networking system for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The social networking system 100 includes a web server 302, a social networking data store 304, a prohibited content data store 306, a machine learning classifier 308, a content moderating engine 110 and a publishing engine 310. In other embodiments, the social networking system 100 may include additional, fewer, or different modules for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web server 302 links the social networking system 100 via the network 220 to one or more client devices 210, as well as to one or more third party websites 140. The web server 302 may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system 100 and the client devices 210 or third party websites 140. The messages can be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique. Additionally, the web server 302 links the social networking system 100 to client devices 210 wherein the client devices can be used to log into the social networking system by using an application executing on the mobile device 210 or by using a web browser executing on the mobile device 210.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social networking data store 302 includes social networking system information that is tracked and maintained by a social networking system. In one embodiment, the social networking system data is stored as a social graph within the social networking system data store 302. The social graph includes a plurality of nodes that are interconnected by a plurality of edges (representing interactions, connections, communications or other measures of relatedness between nodes). A social graph node may represent a social networking system object that can act on and/or be acted upon by another node. An edge between nodes in a social graph represents any kind of connection or interaction between the two nodes, which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. In this description, reference to an edge connecting two objects in a social graph is intended to refer to an edge connecting the nodes representing each of the two objects. In one embodiment, the social graph is used by the collection engine and the analysis engine to display tips to a viewing user within the social networking system. In one embodiment, a non-user entity page may be stored as a node within the social graph. As described in the specification, a non-user entity page may be a page about a business, a product, a band, a song, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prohibited content data store 306 stores words or phrases to ban on a page within the social networking system. The prohibited content data store 306, for example, may include profane or offensive words in languages supported by the social networking system. Additionally, the prohibited content data store 306 may classify the words or phrases as being, for example, sexual in nature, violent in nature, etc. In one embodiment, a content moderator provides a listing of words that are prohibited within a page on the social networking system. In other embodiments, the content moderator provides categories of words and phrases that are prohibited or express certain sentiments such as extreme negativity or anger, etc. In one embodiment, the proscribed words are stored in a trie data structure wherein keys are strings and form a proscribed word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content moderating engine 110 moderates content proscribed by the content moderator by identifying proscribed content and blocking the proscribed content from being displayed to users of the social networking system. In one embodiment, the content moderating engine 110 identifies proscribed text by matching the text in a user comment to the text stored in the prohibited content data store 306. Any number of matching techniques may be used to identify whether text in a user comment is proscribed by a page moderator. In an embodiment wherein the proscribed words are stored in a trie data structure, the content moderating engine 110 searches each word or search starting at each character in a string of proscribed words in the trie data structure. Therefore, the content moderating engine 110 efficiently searches for proscribed content on a page within the social networking system. In other embodiments, the content moderating engine 110 also performs sentiment analysis to identify tone or sentiment that may be proscribed by a content moderator. For example, the content moderating engine 110 may identify proscribed sentiment or phrase by searching for the words in the prohibited content data store 306 wherein words may form a string in a trie database. As such, the content moderating engine 110 may identify proscribed words, sentiment or tones in comments posted by users on a page within the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, the content moderating engine 110 does not display comments containing proscribed content on the page to other users of the social networking system. For example, if a user posts a comment containing proscribed content, the content moderating engine 110 reduces the distribution of the comment to other users of the social networking system by not displaying the comment to other the other users. In one embodiment, the content moderating engine 110 does not provide any text notifying a user that a comment was deleted because of its content. Thus, other users would not know that a comment containing proscribed content was posted on the social networking system page. However, the content moderating engine 110 may display the post to the commenting user and his or her friends. As such, the commenting user and his or her friends may not know that his or her comment is blocked and not displayed to other users of the social networking system. This method of distributing comments provided by users permits a social networking system to distribute comments to users as deemed appropriate based on content that is already available in a forum. In addition, this method does not discourage users from posting content within the social networking system. Instead, it may encourage users to create another forum wherein the comment is distributed more widely based on the content of the new forum. As such, the social networking system is enabled to encourage users to create new forums to share their views rather than commenting in a forum wherein certain comments may be deemed inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, all comments made on a page may be visible to the page moderator. As such, the page moderator may unblock comments that the moderator finds inoffensive or improperly blocked. In one instance, the social networking system compiles a list of content blocked for a particular page. The list, including the blocked content may be sent to the page moderator, wherein the page moderator may review the comments. The list may also include user interface elements allowing the moderator to unblock or make comments visible to other users. Additionally, the moderator may block or reduce the distribution of comments that were allowed by the content moderating engine 110. Similarly, others users of the social networking system may flag comments as being offensive or inappropriate. The machine learning classifier 308 may use the make-visible and flag data to generate a machine learning algorithm to better block or make visible user comments based on parameters providing content that is proscribed. For example, comments that are subsequently blocked or made visible may be used a training data for the classifier. In such an instance the machine learning classifier 308 uses the training data to generate an algorithm providing a likelihood that a comment may comprise proscribed content. The generated algorithm may be used by the content moderating engine 110 to identify comments that contain proscribed content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method of Moderating Comments in an Online Forum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a process for moderating comments in an online forum, in accordance with one embodiment. The social networking system receives 402 a user comment. The received 402 comment may be posted by the user on a page or on an image/video on a page within the social networking system. The content of the comment 402 is stored within the social networking system for display to a viewing user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social networking system matches 404 the content of the user comment to determine if the words or phrases provided in the comment are proscribed. In one embodiment, proscribed words or phrases are stored in a block list. Therefore, the social networking system may match each word or phrase in the comment to the words or phrases provided in the block list. One or more matching techniques may be used to perform such a match. For example, if the block list provides proscribed words or phrases in tie data structure, the social networking system may attempt to match 404 each word in a comment, each character in a word or each word in a phrase in order to match comment content with the block list content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the comment's content matches the block list content 406, the social networking system blocks 412 the comment and notifies the page moderator about the blocked comment. For example, the social networking system may block the comment by making the comment invisible or reducing the distribution of the comment to other users of the social networking system such that the other users do not know that a comment was blocked. If however, the comment's content does not match the block list content 406, the social networking system applies 408 sentiment analysis to the content to determine if the content expresses a proscribed sentiment or a tone. A proscribed sentiment or tone may be identified by matching phrases in the comment with phrases provided in the block list database as described above with reference to proscribed words or phrases. If the comment expresses a proscribed sentiment or tone, it is blocked and the page moderator is notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, the social networking system generates a machine-learned algorithm to calculate a probability that a comment contains proscribed words or phrases based on actions of users on the social networking system. In one embodiment, users may flag a comment as inappropriate or insensitive. For example, the social networking system provides user interface elements that allow users to block each comment displayed on a page. The user interface elements may be provided in reference to each comment. In such an instance, the user input may be used as historic data to build a machine learning classifier. Additionally, a page moderator may provide feedback when a comment is improperly blocked. In such an instance, the moderator actions are used as historic data for the classifier. The machine-learned algorithm is applied 410 by the social networking system to identify a probability that a comment is likely to contain content proscribed by a page administrator. If the probability is higher than a predetermined threshold, the comment is blocked 412 by the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one embodiment, the social networking system blocks 412 a comment by not displaying the comment to other users of the social networking system. For example, the proscribed comment may not be distributed to some of the other users of the social networking system such that they are unable to view the comment. Additionally, the proscribed comment may be displayed to the commenting user such that the commenting user is not made aware that the proscribed comment is not distributed to some of the other users of the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.

<title>GitHub Actions now supports CI/CD, free for public repositories</title>
<link>https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way. With GitHub Actions, workflows and steps are just code in a repository, so you can create, share, reuse, and fork your software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we introduced GitHub Actions last year, the response has been phenomenal, and developers have created thousands of inspired workflows. But we’ve also heard clear feedback from almost everyone: you want CI/CD! And that’s what we’re announcing today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll try out the beta before GitHub Actions is generally available on November 13. We can’t wait to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up for the beta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fast-ci-cd-for-any-os-any-language-and-any-cloud&quot;&gt;Fast CI/CD for any OS, any language, and any cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions now makes it easier to automate how you build, test, and deploy your projects on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Run your workflows in a container or in a virtual machine. Actions also supports more languages and frameworks than ever, including Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, C/C++, .NET, Android, and iOS. Testing multi-container apps? You can now test your web service and its database together by simply adding some &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; to your workflow file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;matrix-builds&quot;&gt;Matrix builds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix builds let you easily test multiple versions of your project in parallel. Add a few lines to the Actions YAML file, and let GitHub take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: [8, 10, 12]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}
    
    - name: npm install, build and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present
        npm test&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;live-logs-show-you-real-time-feedback&quot;&gt;Live logs show you real-time feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live logs provide rich feedback into the progress of your builds as they run. GitHub streams your logs to the Actions console to show your status in real time. Logs are formatted for easy reading, including emojis. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can deep-link to any line in any log file with a clean and simple permalink, making it easy for you to discuss a build failure or test result with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-49923&quot; src=&quot;https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/streaming.gif?w=918&amp;amp;resize=918%2C802&quot; alt=&quot;Live logs stream your workflow as it happens.&quot; width=&quot;918&quot; height=&quot;802&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-and-reuse-actions-and-workflows-like-code&quot;&gt;Write and reuse actions and workflows like code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions are code—so you can edit, reuse, share, and fork them like code. When you fork a repository, you fork the actions along with the source code, giving you a seamless way to test and build projects using the same Actions as the original project. We think this is a great way to learn from the community, by reproducing every step of your favorite projects, then forking them to suit your own requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions uses a clean new syntax for expressing workflows based on YAML. You can reuse actions and workflows by referring to them as simple repository references, making it easy to stitch them together into powerful workflows. Write them in JavaScript or create a container Action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also reuse a rich ecosystem of Actions from our partners, such as LaunchDarkly, mabl, Code Climate, GitKraken, or even trigger builds on other CI providers, like CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;automate-workflows-on-any-event-even-your-own&quot;&gt;Automate workflows on any event—even your own&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions helps you build, test, and deploy applications, but you can also use it to automate other tasks common to your developer workflows: triaging and managing issues, automating releases, collaborating with your user base, and more. Actions workflows can be triggered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; from across the developer life cycle on GitHub. Any GitHub App can now add its own custom events, so developers and partners can customize GitHub to meet the needs of any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-on-an-integrated-package-and-container-registry&quot;&gt;Build on an integrated package and container registry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing packages and containers are a key part of any CI/CD workflow, such as open source libraries or deploying a large web service. GitHub Actions makes it easy to publish and consume packages from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/package-registry&quot;&gt;GitHub Package Registry&lt;/a&gt; or any other registry. As developers gain access to Actions, they’ll also have access to GitHub Package Registry before general availability to automate entire workflows across issues and code, from build to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;suggested-workflows-make-it-easy-to-get-started&quot;&gt;Suggested workflows make it easy to get started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make it as easy as possible for you to get started with CI/CD. Now when you enable Actions for your repository, GitHub will suggest Actions workflows that are appropriate for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-49924&quot; src=&quot;https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=1024&amp;amp;resize=1024%2C254&quot; alt=&quot;Suggested workflows help you get started with CI/CD and GitHub Actions by drawing from projects like yours.&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; srcset=&quot;https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=2152 2152w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=1024&amp;amp;resize=1024%2C254 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png?w=2000 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;simple-pay-as-you-go-pricing&quot;&gt;Simple, pay-as-you-go pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want every open source project to be productive and use best practices, so Actions is free for the 40 million developers on GitHub to use with public repositories. For private repositories, Actions offers simple, pay-as-you-go pricing. If you want to run on your own hardware or another cloud, our self-hosted runners are free to use. And during the beta, Actions is free for everyone. For full details, see the pricing section on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions&quot;&gt;sign up page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next-for-actions&quot;&gt;What’s next for Actions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to be excited about in this update to Actions, and there’s lots more to come. Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-hosted runners&lt;/strong&gt;. If you already have your own VMs within your data centers or as instances you manage in the cloud, you can use Actions to automate your workflows with the same simplicity and speed. Install the Actions runner on your VM and register them with Actions. Workloads that execute on self-hosted runners are free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions for GitHub Enterprise Server&lt;/strong&gt;. Next year, we’ll make Actions available to our GitHub Enterprise Server customers, including a hybrid option for on-premises deployments that keeps your code and packages in your data center while GitHub orchestrates your workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;sign-up-for-the-beta&quot;&gt;Sign up for the beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to make this new version of Actions available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions&quot;&gt;Learn more and sign up for the beta&lt;/a&gt;, which is free now until we make Actions generally available at GitHub Universe on November 13.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Death of Social Reciprocity in the Era of Digital Distraction</title>
<link>https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-death-of-social-reciprocity-in-the-era-of-digital-distraction/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-death-of-social-reciprocity-in-the-era-of-digital-distraction/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re walking along the street, and bump into a friend. After a quick hello, this friend compliments you. What do you do in response? Most likely, offer a compliment in return. Or, at the least, say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few steps further down the street, you see someone drop a wallet. You pick it up and hand it to them. They say thank you. Your response: “You’re welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, interactions throughout each day are filled with social reciprocity. It’s instantaneous and second nature. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/gratitude-uniquely-human-or-shared-with-animals/&quot;&gt;chimps&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to engage in it. It can be a very good thing. But in recent years, digital distraction has turned it into a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explain in my book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifescaling.me/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lifescale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; many creators of digital platforms have studied psychology. Their goal has been to eat up more and more of our days. Through persuasive design, they’ve worked to manipulate human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the attention economy is wildly lucrative. Our attention is the currency; it’s what we pay to use these platforms for free. It’s also finite, so there’s limited supply and great demand. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; his company’s number one competitor was sleep. “And, we’re winning!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.briansolis.com/&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; in Silicon Valley as a digital futurist and adviser to many social media companies, I’ve seen the myriad ways the purveyors of these technologies work to get users addicted. They’ve been so successful that there’s even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-study-nomophobia-mdash-fear-of-being-without-a-mobile-phone/&quot;&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; for fear of being without your cell phone, “nomophobia.” One trick that gets too little attention (pun intended) is the psychological hijack of social reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital world, interactions take place at an unprecedented pace. People like or share your posts and tag you in theirs. They send you connection requests or follow you, and often expect you to do the same in return. Notifications show people when you have read their messages, so they might find it rude if you don’t respond relatively soon. After you respond, you see those wavering dots of someone composing a reply to you, so you know the conversation is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this makes you feel anticipation and pressure to stay engaged, respond, check back and interact. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5jkb/the-secret-ways-social-media-is-built-for-addiction&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 that Snapchat’s elongating red lines displaying “the number of days of since two users interacted” even reportedly led some teens to ask friends “to babysit their streaks”—that is, to interact on their behalf—while they were on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the new norm. We’ve been fooled into believing we’re more connected, informed, productive, creative and happy. But in reality, this kind of social reciprocity eats away at our norms and values, and rebuilds them in harmful ways. As a former Facebook executive &lt;a href=&quot;http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know from experience what a toll this can take. Several years ago, I found myself struggling. I couldn’t concentrate on work, and often wasn’t fully present with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was totally distracted, being drawn to notification after notification. I’d tell myself not to reach for my phone. But within minutes (or seconds), I’d nevertheless be checking out a picture that a friend just posted on Instagram, and composing a response to let him know that I’d seen and enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year went by before I realized I had to press pause on all of it. I wasn’t just losing productivity, but also my creative spark and even my ability to feel happiness. Worst of all, my relationships were suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle the part of your mind that feels—instinctively—that you owe it to people to reciprocate, I recommend two key steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Honor your right to disconnect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, France officially gave workers the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/02/technology/france-office-email-workers-law/index.html&quot;&gt;right to disconnect&lt;/a&gt;” from e-mail after work hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we take that idea and broaden it out? We all have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to disconnect from the bombardment of notifications. And that means we have a right to not reciprocate instantly to online interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of it this way, as a right, can be psychologically empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Focus on strengthening real relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other step is to focus on strengthening your relationships with those closest to you by carving out time for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Lifescale,&lt;/em&gt; I explain the steps I took to overcome my tech addiction. One was to list the values most important to me and the actions I would take to honor them. As part of this, I vowed in writing to carve out uninterrupted time for family and help those relationships grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping in mind that interaction online took time away from work or family, I learned to ease off the pressure of digital social reciprocity. I took back control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, some people don’t hear back from me as quickly as they used to. I hear all the time from people who are genuinely upset with me about that. But my personal life and career have never been better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>AMD lands Google, Twitter as customers with newest server chip</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amd-alphabet/amd-lands-google-twitter-as-customers-with-newest-server-chip-idUSKCN1UX2KL</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amd-alphabet/amd-lands-google-twitter-as-customers-with-newest-server-chip-idUSKCN1UX2KL</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AMD.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AMD.O&quot;&gt;AMD.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) on Wednesday released the second generation of its processor chip for data centers and said that it had landed Alphabet Inc’ (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_GOOGL.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Google and Twitter Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_TWTR.N_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=TWTR.N&quot;&gt;TWTR.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) as customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD competes against Intel Corp (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_INTC.O_3”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=INTC.O&quot;&gt;INTC.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) to supply chips for data centers that power internet-based services. Both firms have come to rely on data center chips for growth because personal computer sales have stagnated as users shifted to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD’s newest generation of server chip, called EPYC, uses a new chip-making technology from its contract manufacturers that helps the chips have better performance while consuming less power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, which makes chips in its own factories instead of relying on contractors, is behind schedule delivering chips made with its own newer manufacturing process. It plans to release them next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD has tried to take advantage of that by courting some of Intel’s biggest customers, such as Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD said on Thursday that Google is using its second-generation EPYC server chip in Google’s internal data centers and that Google will offer it to external developers as part of its cloud computing offerings later this year. It is the first time Google has publicly acknowledged using AMD’s EPYC chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel shares were down 0.6% to $46.42 in after-hours trading after AMD’s customer announcements. AMD shares were up 0.3% to $29.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, which said that both Google and Twitter remain customers, is the dominant supplier of data center chips, with more than 90% of the market under its control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AMD has been making inroads with its most recent chips. Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights &amp;amp; Strategy, said he estimates that AMD took “low single-digit” market share from Intel with the first generation of EPYC server chips and that he expects that share to expand with the second generation announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance, Moorhead said the new AMD chips are better than Intel’s chips at some kinds of computing work but may lag on others. He said that new Intel chip features for machine learning tasks and new Intel memory technology being with customers such as German software firm SAP SE (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_SAPG.DE_4”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=SAPG.DE&quot;&gt;SAPG.DE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) could give Intel an advantage in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moorhead said in a research note that most every large business he talks to “wants more competition in the space to accelerate innovation and lower costs. With that said, none of these customers would adopt AMD if it didn’t have some advantages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-plan offices offer few pleasures; one of them is snooping on other people’s browsing habits. When, years ago, I began working for tech companies in San Francisco, I noticed that my co-workers were always scrolling through a beige, text-only Web site that resembled a nineteen-nineties Internet forum. They were reading Hacker News—a link aggregator and message board that is something of a Silicon Valley institution. Technologists in Silicon Valley assume familiarity with Hacker News, just as New Yorkers do with the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; and the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. For some, it’s the first Web site they pull up in the morning; it captures the mix of technical obsession, business ambition, and aspirational curiosity that’s typical of the Valley. On any given day, its top links might include a Medium post about &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/brief-thoughts-on-getting-hired-as-a-senior-coder-94f38998bb08&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technical hiring&lt;/a&gt;; a 1997 article from &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; magazine about &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/2152131/freezing-death?page=all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freezing to death&lt;/a&gt;; an open-source &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20571739&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual private network&lt;/a&gt; hosted on GitHub; an &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt;, from 2006, about compiler construction; an &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20297446&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook’s corporate communications team; a personal blog post about Linux kernels, and another about &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selling Vidalia onions&lt;/a&gt; on the Internet. Nearly all the software engineers I know check it religiously. Not one of them has a neutral opinion about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many of the software products that have shaped the Valley, Hacker News began as a side project. In 2007, the venture capitalist Paul Graham, who was then the president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator—an early investor in Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Twitch, and other companies—built the site as a way to experiment with Arc, a new programming language that he was co-authoring. Originally, Graham named the site Startup News. He hoped that it would serve as a new home for the startup founders and “would-be founders” who had once gathered on Reddit, before that site grew too popular to feel like a community. Among other benefits, he imagined that Startup News might help him find worthy entrepreneurs. (“There are a number of Reddit users that I know only by their usernames, but I know must be smart from the things they’ve written,” he explained, in his launch announcement. “We’re counting on the same phenomenon to help us decide who to fund.”) Within a few months, though, Graham found that startup-centric conversation had its limits. He renamed the site Hacker News, and expanded its focus to include “anything that good hackers would find interesting . . . anything that gratifies one’s intellectual curiosity.” (Hacker News is still owned by Y Combinator.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was intentionally simple. It offered a dynamic list of links, submitted by users, each of which could be expanded into its own unique comment thread. Readers could upvote or downvote links and comments, and the top thirty links would be featured on the front page. The guidelines specified that most non-tech-related news—political news, in particular—was off topic. Users discussed the merits of relational databases, the complexities of co-founder relationships, and the pros and cons of dropping out of college. They exchanged screenshots of their work environments and compared their results on a “nerd quiz” that asked them to name a programming language for every letter of the alphabet. They commented on Graham’s essays about programming and entrepreneurship—“Like chess or painting or writing novels,” he &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811433&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “making money is a very specialized skill”—and shared advice on how to get into Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the site attracted about sixteen hundred daily visitors, and Graham moderated and maintained it himself. Today, around five million people read Hacker News each month, and it’s grown more difficult to moderate. The technical discussions remain varied and can be insightful. But social, cultural, and political conversations, which, despite the guidelines, have proliferated, tend to devolve. A recent comment thread about &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/business/youtube-remove-extremist-videos.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, “YouTube to Remove Thousands of Videos Pushing Extreme Views,” yielded a response likening journalism and propaganda; a muddled juxtaposition of pornography and Holocaust denial; a vague side conversation about the average I.Q. of Hacker News commenters; and confused analogies between white supremacists and Black Lives Matter activists. In April, when &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47891902&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a story&lt;/a&gt; about Katie Bouman, an M.I.T. researcher who helped develop a technology that captured the first photo of a black hole, rose to the front page, users combed through her code on GitHub in an effort to undermine the weight of her contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site’s now characteristic tone of performative erudition—hyperrational, dispassionate, contrarian, authoritative—often masks a deeper recklessness. Ill-advised citations proliferate; thought experiments abound; humane arguments are dismissed as emotional or irrational. Logic, applied narrowly, is used to justify broad moral positions. The most admired arguments are made with data, but the origins, veracity, and malleability of those data tend to be ancillary concerns. The message-board intellectualism that might once have impressed V.C. observers like Graham has developed into an intellectual style all its own. Hacker News readers who visit the site to learn how engineers and entrepreneurs talk, and what they talk about, can find themselves immersed in conversations that resemble the output of duelling Markov bots trained on libertarian economics blogs, “The Tim Ferriss Show,” and the work of Yuval Noah Harari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been trying to outsmart one another on Internet forums for as long as there have been Internet forums. Still, Hacker News has an unusually wide influence. Landing a blog post or personal project on the front page is a badge of honor for many technologists, and the site has become a regional export: ninety per cent of its traffic comes from outside the Bay Area, and a third of its users are in Europe. The site is now a portal to tech culture for millions of people. At the same time, it has become a punch line and a punching bag for tech workers and engineers who see it as a locus of hubris, myopia, and exclusivity. A word that comes up frequently among its critics is “toxic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;157.67902197023&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picturing the moderators responsible for steering conversation on Hacker News, I imagined a team of men who proudly self-identify as neoliberals and are active in the effective-altruism movement. (I assumed they’d be white men; it never occurred to me that women, or people of color, could be behind the site.) Meeting them, I feared, would be like participating in a live-action comment thread about the merits of Amazon Web Services or whether women should be referred to as “females.” “Debate us!” I imagined them saying, in unison, from their Aeron chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site’s real-life moderators are Daniel Gackle and Scott Bell, two wildly polite old friends. On Facebook and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-fight-for-the-future-of-youtube&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, moderation is often done reactively and anonymously, by teams of overworked contractors; on &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/reddit-and-the-struggle-to-detoxify-the-internet&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, teams of employees purge whole user communities like surgeons removing tumors. Gackle and Bell, by contrast, practice a personal, focussed, and slow approach to moderation, which they see as a conversational act. They treat their community like an encounter group or Esalen workshop; often, they correspond with individual Hacker News readers over e-mail, coaching and encouraging them in long, heartfelt exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle and Bell met in Calgary, in the early two-thousands, at a local user group for the rarefied programming language Lisp. (Arc, the language in which Hacker News is written, is a descendant of it.) Gackle, whose name is pronounced “Gack-lee” and who declined to share his age, is a muscular, bald, and loquacious father of two and a devoted fan of the Canadian sketch-comedy show “The Kids in the Hall.” Bell, who is thirty-four, is willowy and soft-spoken, with closely buzzed hair and tattoos that peek out from beneath his cardigans. The two often finish each other’s sentences; they sometimes dress, accidentally, in matching outfits. (Bell attributes this to office-wide “sartorial mimetics.”) Online and in person, Gackle is chatty, Bell reserved. They are reluctant, protective spokespeople. Pressed to describe Hacker News, they do so by means of extravagant, sometimes tender metaphors: the site is a “social ecosystem,” a “hall of mirrors,” a “public park or garden,” a “fractal tree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hacker News is quite a counterintuitive thing,” Gackle said, in a conference room in Y Combinator’s San Francisco office. “At least how we see it, from our perspective, it’s often pretty different from how it appears from the outside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t grab you right away, just on the surface,” Bell said, his hands cradling a mug of tea. “It takes a little bit to get a feel for what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Hacker News front page is a product of a certain tension,” Gackle said. “There’s multiple tug-of-wars going on over the types of stories people would like to see. The one consensus is that it’s not as good as it used to be. I feel bad when people say that, but I also realize that, in a way, it indicates a certain attachment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are some people who don’t realize Hacker News is moderated at all,” Bell continued. “There are some people with whom we’ve been e-mailing for four or five years. My guess is that the distribution is somewhat mostly in the middle. But I don’t know.” He turned to Gackle, looking grave. “I don’t have a strong sense of that. Do you, Dan?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think I can answer it,” Gackle said, intently. “One of the things I’ve learned is that almost all of the generalizations are wrong. And I’ve learned this because people love to post generalizations about Hacker News to Hacker News.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an Emacs file, Gackle collects a list of contradictory statements that people have used to describe Hacker News. (“SJW cesspool”; “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14205262&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a haven&lt;/a&gt; for alt-right and libertarian people”; “If you don’t support neoliberal fantasies, your comments &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14529468&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;probably aren’t welcome here&lt;/a&gt;”; “The only thing is left is to change Hacker News icon &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18189135&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to Che Guevara emblem&lt;/a&gt;.”) He and Bell assert their own opinions in subtle ways. Recently, they made some small changes to the Hacker News guidelines, which have always hewed closely to those that Graham drafted in 2007. To one about throwaway accounts—acceptable for sensitive information but discouraged as a regular practice—they added the reminder “HN is a community.” In another—“Comments should get more civil and substantive, not less, as a topic becomes more divisive”—they changed the phrase “civil and substantive” to “thoughtful and substantive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, an essay in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; titled “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Do Elephants Have Souls?&lt;/a&gt;,” from 2013, hit the front page. The piece generated immediate resistance. Commenters responded literally to the question posed in the title and bickered about the word “soul.” Conversation spiralled, with users making arguments about Cartesian metaphysics and quoting Socrates. “Why is such an unscientific question so high on HN?” one commenter asked. “Or to rephrase, if we don’t know what a soul is, how can we hope to answer it WRT elephants? So how and why should a reasoning person rate an article like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The article itself is just this wonderful exploration into the literature around elephants,” Gackle told me. “I don’t know how anybody could read that article and not just go, like, ‘Wow’—I mean, at least if you’re interested in elephants in any way.” Posting under his Hacker News username, dang, he staged a moderate intervention. “All: This article is not about souls,” he wrote. “It’s about elephants, humans, how we relate to elephants, how they relate to us, how humans relate to non-humans.” He continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is erudite and beautiful. It uses the astonishing literature about elephants to ask about ourselves, them, and the world. “Soul” here is a trope for aspects of humanness that we may or may not have in common. Usually, we just edit titles that are triggering people. If I were to do that here, I might rename it “Elephants and Anthropomorphism.” But when an article is this rich, moving, even profound, taking away its title would maim it. It bears a much better discussion than the thread has given it so far, so please let’s talk about what’s interesting and stay off the metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader, with the username solipsism, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19836914&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;objected to Gackle’s claims&lt;/a&gt; about what was and wasn’t interesting. “Most would agree there’s a point at which moderation goes too far,” solipsism wrote. “I can’t tell if you’re making an appeal as a person, or making a decree as a moderator. I read the article, and it’s absolutely full of metaphysics. . . . These metaphysical topics interest me, and apparently they interested the writer, even if they don’t interest you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle conceded that his dismissal was unfair. He removed the reference to metaphysics from his comment. “The point is simply that the article deserves a better discussion,” he wrote, with breezy, cheerful weariness. “I’m making an appeal as a moderator person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell and Gackle didn’t set out to become forum moderators. At Stanford, Gackle wrote a master’s thesis on Pyotr Vyazemsky and Nikolay Karamzin, two nineteenth-century Russian poets; Bell studied network engineering, at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, after a stint performing in punk, hardcore, and metalcore bands. When they met, in the Lisp user group, they both were working as coders and unfulfilled by their office jobs. Gackle later told me that he sees frustration at work as part of the DNA of Hacker News. “The instinct that there simply has to be a better way to build systems, and the yearning to connect with it,” he said. “If you can’t do that at your job, and few can, then you can at least dream and read and argue about it on the Internet. Hacker News is the inverse image of many people’s jobs, overlaid on top of each other—an escape valve for frustrated idealists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell had discovered Lisp while staving off boredom in a college computer-science course (he read technical documentation to pass the time); Gackle learned about it as a child, in &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/em&gt; magazine. “When I program in other languages, even ones I know well,” he said, “I feel like I’ve flown to Jupiter. Gravity is so strong that every step is a struggle. In Lisp, you can dance.” In the user group, they found they had overlapping intellectual interests and complementary programming skills. Gackle worked at what he calls “a sort of product factory” where he built “little Potemkin products that would mostly get killed.” He had come to feel that he was helping to build software for users who didn’t need it; what they needed, he believed, was a customizable spreadsheet that improved on Microsoft Excel. (“Excel was these users’ Garden of Eden, where they could make their own spreadsheets and play with them in endless bliss, but they were cast out of Eden because their problems were too complex,” he told me.) In 2008, he and Bell formed a startup, Skysheet, with the mission of building a Web-based spreadsheet. A few months later, they were accepted into Y Combinator, which they’d learned about through Graham’s essays. They moved to Silicon Valley at the height of the recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skysheet’s Y Combinator “class” of sixteen companies included Heyzap, a mobile-ad network that was acquired in 2015, for forty-five million dollars, and a struggling travel startup that would go on to become Airbnb. At the end of the program, the other founders in the group voted Skysheet the third most likely to succeed. But, after Y Combinator, Bell and Gackle found it difficult to fund-raise. It was the spring of 2009, and the market was bottoming out. “We learned that fund-raising means presenting yourself as impressive, desirable, and just about to be huge, even if the person you’re talking to is so mistaken as not to invest,” Gackle recalled. (Hearing this, I thought of the rhetorical style so widely deployed on Hacker News.) “Perhaps it’s partly the Canadianness, but this does not come naturally to either Scott or me.” Eventually, they raised a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and moved back to Canada to build the software. Some of the technical challenges were more complex than they’d anticipated; there was no existing literature to guide them. As delays mounted, Gackle had panic attacks nightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2012, Skysheet had yet to launch a public product and had run out of money. Bell made the painful decision to leave the company, taking a job with a software consultancy. Gackle forged ahead. “My feeling was I would rather fail at this than succeed at anything else,” he told me. Later that year, Graham reached out with an invitation to work on Hacker News, which, at that point, had nearly two million users. “I said no, because I knew it would mean no longer being able to think about spreadsheet software all day,” Gackle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That August, Gackle went for a hike in the Rockies. He slipped and fell on a mountainside, tumbling downhill, bouncing off the rocks. Somehow, he rolled to a stop against a boulder. Shaken, he hiked home. “It jolted me deeply, and after that I admitted to myself that I also was out of money and needed a job,” Gackle recalled. He reached out to Graham: “I told him yes, but with a feeling of unfinished business about this technical problem, which I still carry.” He became a behind-the-scenes moderator of Hacker News. A couple of years later, he hired Bell. In a way, they were perfectly prepared. Having briefly lived the dream and failed, they would now immerse themselves in a culture in which winning—an argument, a market—is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle and Bell are the only Y Combinator employees working on the site. In addition to moderating it, they maintain its technical infrastructure. (When I mentioned, at a party, that I was writing about Hacker News, an entrepreneur blurted, “It’s the fastest Web site I use!”) They post in comment threads, defending commenters who encounter combative or aggressive behavior and content that’s been downvoted, flagged, or misunderstood; they sometimes spend hours a day e-mailing with individual users, helping them use Hacker News more conscientiously and effectively. (“Present this not primarily as a moral appeal . . . but as an intellectual one,” Gackle wrote, over e-mail, to a user who was soliciting help for a man who had recently been exonerated after eleven years in prison for a crime he did not commit. “You should frame it as a puzzle or an engineering problem. That will engage the community’s curiosity, which is your only hope for getting a real discussion going.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way to learn it is to get it wrong, and, when you get it wrong, you get flamed,” Gackle said, in the conference room. “And you get flamed so hard that it’s like being stung by a swarm of bees. It’s sort of like operant conditioning. If you put yourself in that position, where you’re getting stung on a daily basis, you’re soon going to start learning what makes the bees less likely. . . .” he paused. “Or, actually, I like bees. I would say ‘wasps’—what makes the wasps less likely to bite you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other way to learn is to let someone else get stung first,” Bell said, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;217.64590132463&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, 2016—about a month after Donald Trump’s election—&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/30/researchers-may-have-found-many-of-chinas-30-million-missing-girls/?utm_term=.6a8ddb01a670&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; from the Washington &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; hit Hacker News’ front page. The article covered a study of China’s “one child” policy, conducted by researchers at the University of Kansas and Shaanxi Normal University, that claimed that female children who were long believed to have been aborted or killed in infancy were simply not registered with the government at birth. The ensuing conversation rapidly devolved into arguments over whether or not institutional barriers exist; whether it was acceptable for users to correct the grammar of commenters whose first language was not English; whether sublimated testosterone was responsible for jihad and sexual assaults in Germany; the merits of Jill Stein; and voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every single time poll restrictions have been proposed, it’s been for racist causes,” one user wrote, in response to a commenter with the username rokosbasilisk, who was advocating for a voter-identification system. “You yourself may not be a hooded member of the KKK, but you are pushing for the same things, and that’s all that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“so india wanted to voter id to prevent black people from voting?” rokosbasilisk responded. “seriously the race stuff just doesnt matter if we follow the indian model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have more faith in black people than you i guess, and think they are perfectly capable of getting an id,” a third user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This has taken us into sociopolitical hell,” Bell posted, “and Hacker News isn’t that kind of site.” He “detached” some of the more inflammatory conversations from the main thread, hiding them from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That discussion, and also several others that emerged in the weeks after the election, prompted Gackle and Bell to experiment with and idea they called Political Detox Week. For seven days, political stories and threads would be considered off-topic and flagged by the moderators. The experiment was met with both relief and derision. “Political discourse is antithetical to rational, intelligent discussion,” one user wrote, in a comment that was upvoted to the top of the thread about the detox week. “Technological topics are always interesting to me . . . I love that there’s this corner of the Internet where I can participate in a reasoned, interesting technical community. Please don’t ruin it with politics, especially the polarizing American variant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the page, another user expressed disdain for the experiment. “The idea that we can carve out a space that exists outside of politics and ideology is delusional,” the user wrote. “Squelching political discussion won’t cause us all to transcend ideology, it’ll just make it impossible to discuss or critique a dominant ideology whenever one shows up in someone’s unstated assumptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course it’s delusional,” Gackle replied. “And still we have to moderate this site.” Three days later, he &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13131251&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Political Detox Week would be coming to an end. They’d learned, among other things, that “it’s impossible to define ‘politics’ with any consensus because that question is itself highly political.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most ideologically motivated or extreme posts and comments on Hacker News—an interview piece from Quillette titled “Understanding Victimhood Culture”; a link to a video of &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-silicon-valleys-workplace-culture-produced-james-damores-google-memo&quot;&gt;James Damore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity&quot;&gt;Jordan Peterson&lt;/a&gt; in conversation; one user telling another that all Jewish people should &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13056816&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relocate&lt;/a&gt; to Israel—tend to get flagged by the community or the site’s anti-abuse systems, many of which Bell and Gackle have written themselves. (Flagged posts are removed from view, though they remain searchable by URL; flagged comments are rendered in pale gray text, and only visible to logged-in users who have chosen to see “dead” comments.) Still, as an occasional reader, I have noticed certain trends. When stories that focus on structural barriers faced by women in the workplace, or on diversity in tech, or on race or masculinity—stories, admittedly, that are more intriguing to me, a person interested in the humanities, than stories on technical topics—hit the front page, users often flag them, presumably for being off topic, so fast that hardly any comments accrue. When I shared these impressions with Gackle and Bell, they looked distressed. I asked if these were problems that they felt they could, or should, be controlling or trying to change on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From our perspective, the big surprise is how little control we actually have. We have to play our cards very carefully and very wisely, or even that control will sort of evaporate,” Gackle said. “There’s often a strong wish to solve these contentious problems by changing the software, and, to the extent that we’ve tried things like that, we haven’t found it to work. What does seem to work better is personal interaction, over and over and over again, with individual users. That, case by case by case, seems to move the needle. But it’s very slow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to change something deep, the ingredient is time,” Bell said. “Patience allows us to be ambitious—to imagine people being more kind to each other, for example. It sounds kind of crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gackle and Bell, moderating Hacker News has presented an opportunity for self-work. Together, they have read up on nonviolent communication, sociology, and psychotherapy. (Bell found Carl Rogers’s “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/039575531X/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On Becoming a Person&lt;/a&gt;”—a 1961 book about personal growth that became a bible of the humanistic-psychology movement—particularly valuable.) Gackle is drawn to healing workshops; Bell, to Indian philosophy. They seem, at times, to be applying old, humanist techniques to a culture obsessed with the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Something that’s deeply interesting, I think, to both of us,” Gackle said, “is the way in which one can arrive at a nonviolent reaction to somebody by having greater awareness of the—” He paused. “I’ll say violence in oneself. By which I mean the kind of agitation and activation that is causing people, including ourselves, to react in a kind of fight-or-flight way that leads to misunderstanding, conflict, and, ultimately, Internet flame wars. This seemingly trivial stuff, about people getting mad at other people on the Internet, is actually tied to this much deeper and more fascinating process of what goes on between people and what goes on in oneself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s another opportunity for us to influence the system, by exemplifying the kind of patterns of discussion that we would like to see,” Bell said. “We just want to constantly set an example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; ran &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/lens/sarah-lewis-racial-bias-photography.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; by Sarah Lewis, a Harvard professor, titled “The Racial Bias Built Into Photography.” The essay was a historical inquiry, inspecting lens development and film-emulsion technology, and was written in the first person. When it landed on Hacker News, users immediately rushed to flag it as off topic. Gackle changed the title to “Photography and racial bias,” and turned off flagging, which restored the essay to its original position on the front page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take issue with this article simply because photography isn’t a technology at all,” one user commented. “It is an art that uses technology. There are millions of pictures of people of all races that look perfectly fine. I take issue with stirring up people for no reason. If a maker of paints in the 1800s owned slaves does that mean that painting (then, now, in the future) is racist? How ridiculous can we get?” Another user &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19755097&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the opening lines of Rudyard Kipling’s poem “The White Man’s Burden.” A third wrote, “The people who invented the tech (US/Europe/Japan) optimised it for consumers around them. Why hate on inventors who create something cool just because it doesn’t quite work as well for all groups of people? Surely this also left a gap in the market—someone could have optimized film for darker skin tones and made a lot of money?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ ‘Hating’ is much too strong a word to describe the article, so much so that invoking it in a thread like this is a big upping of the flamewar ante,” Gackle replied, in the thread. He pointed the user to the site guidelines, encouraging more constructive input. He acknowledged that it was “hard to resist” inflammatory language “when a topic stirs up powerful emotions”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a need for relief, and venting that energy in the form of extreme words is one way to get relief. Unfortunately, it doesn’t relieve anything at a community level. It just tosses the hot potato around in a way that only makes the potato hotter and more painful to the one who catches it next. What provides relief at a community level is when people find ability in themselves to acknowledge truth in what the other is saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Gackle and Bell have come to recognize their own triggers—patterns of online discourse that enrage them, depress them, or make them want to walk away. “In terms of the psychological experience of doing this job, all of your buttons are being pushed on a regular basis,” Gackle said. He now knows that it will be hard for him to keep his composure when he is being falsely accused or completely misread. (“That’s pretty much what some of the users do all day—accuse the moderators of doing something that they didn’t,” he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell, for his part, becomes soul-weary when exposed to the unceasing spectacle of “people treating other people poorly.” “My reaction for things that get me is depressive,” Bell said. “Rather than respond outwardly, I have that internal depressive response. The issue for me is that this thing I’m very sensitive to is present in nearly everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle looked on as Bell spoke, then turned to me. “The sheer quantity of it is so overwhelming that one does have a depressive reaction, a hopeless reaction to it, at times,” he said. “I realized at some point that my feelings about it were like the feelings of a child trying to keep the family together. When the family is five million people, that’s a pretty tall order. It isn’t something that’s achievable. One has to learn to let go of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry, dang is not adding anything to the conversation,” a user wrote, in the thread about race and photography. “He just enjoys virtue signaling. Hard!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;162&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hacker News has grown, it has become the subject of both scrutiny and parody. A Twitter account, @shit_hn_says, highlights standout quotes from the comments section. (“If you want to do business with Iran, why don’t you just use Bitcoin?”) A hashtag, #HNwatch, collects screenshots of racist, sexist, xenophobic, and otherwise offensive or bizarre Hacker News comments. (“As a white man, I have concerns that my ethnic/gender group is being persecuted.” “In a way, the brains of startup founders and those below poverty lines work in the same way.”) Detractors refer to it as “the orange Web site,” a way of demonstrating both insider familiarity and exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-gate, a satirical Web site with the slogan “We can’t both be right” (a NAND gate is a kind of logic gate that only outputs “false” if all of its inputs read “true”), offers a weekly summary of Hacker News discussions, dubbed “webshit weekly.” The N-gate entry about a Hacker News discussion of a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article on the crashes of two Boeing 737 airliners, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, is typical. “Discussing a pair of crashes that killed almost three hundred and fifty people,” it reads, “Hacker News can’t decide whether the failure was one of user experience or branding. Other Hackernews”—as it calls commenters—“think that this plane would have worked better if it were designed by programmers with a tendency to work late for free. A majority of the comments are Hackernews incorrecting one another about FAA regulations, avionics, and lift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietor of N-gate is an engineer who grew up in Palo Alto and now lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he works in high-performance computing. He agreed to exchange e-mails on condition of anonymity. “Almost every post deals with the same topics: these are people who spend their lives trying to identify all the ways they can extract money from others without quite going to jail,” he wrote. “They’re people who are convinced that they are too special for rules, and too smart for education. They don’t regard themselves as inhabiting the world the way other people do; they’re secret royalty, detached from society’s expectations and unfailingly outraged when faced with normal consequences for bad decisions. Society, and especially economics, is a logic puzzle where you just have to find the right set of loopholes to win the game. Rules are made to be slipped past, never stopping to consider why someone might have made those rules to start with. Silicon Valley has an ethics problem, and ‘Hacker’ ‘News’ is where it’s easiest to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, the phrase “Eternal September” has been used to describe the tipping point for a message board or online community—the inclusion, or invasion, of new users who dramatically change the existing subculture. (The term originated in September, 1993, after America Online made Usenet, a decades-old message-board system, accessible to many of its members, who were new to the Internet.) The creation of Startup News was a response to Reddit’s Eternal September; some of the problems with which Gackle and Bell are grappling can be traced to a similar phenomenon at Hacker News. The question they face now is whether the site’s original culture can be responsibly scaled up, or adapted, to make space for a more inclusive, wider-ranging vision of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle and Bell continue to believe in the value of “intellectual curiosity” as a goal. They speak of it more as a relative state than a fixed condition, using terms like “freshness” and “excitement” and “surprise and delight.” They are hopeful that, as Hacker News continues to grow, it will become, simultaneously, more diverse, more interesting, and more humane, while remaining in some fundamental sense a single community with a common goal. “The much larger sites, like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, all scaled by sharding,” Gackle told me, over e-mail. “HN has no shards. We have no social graph either. Everybody is in it together whether they like it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intellectual curiosity is everywhere, and it’s present in all demographics,” Bell said, in the conference room. “We want Hacker News to grow in all demographics, because there’s just intellectually interesting contributions from all of those communities—a greater diversity of content, of conversations, of topics, et cetera.” (He and Gackle have discussed diversifying their team, and adding a third moderator who is non-white, non-male, and, Bell joked, “non-balding.” Gackle clarified: “We've talked to each other about that. But we wouldn't make it a requirement.”) And yet the influx of outsiders doesn’t just change a community; it exposes its assumptions. The tech industry as a whole is having its own Eternal September. The world, with all its experiences and opinions, has come flooding in, and technologists are now reassessing the consequences of the systems and structures they have built or inherited. Some of these systems are social, and include the general modes of thought and expression that Hacker News embodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the conference room, it was early evening. Through the frosted glass, we could see the shapes of Y Combinator’s employees shrugging on their backpacks and depositing their mugs in the kitchen sink. “It might seem like ‘intellectual curiosity’ isn’t primarily an ethical concern,” Gackle said. “But it actually turns out that those things are deeply related. There’s something about the way that curiosity works: it needs a kind of gentleness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after meeting with Gackle and Bell, I checked Hacker News to see what commenters were saying about a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story on the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’s antitrust work with the Federal Trade Commission. Users speculated about Hughes’s personal motivations and asked whether he had the knowledge necessary to help the government break up Facebook. Elsewhere on the site, people discussed California’s housing crisis (“The whole problem could be solved if we gave people the choice of voting where they work rather than where they live”) and a new scripting language, ChaiScript (“There’s no inherent reason a header-only library should significantly impact compile times, aside from the fact that the authors usually don’t have the foresight to make it efficient”). Skipping from thread to thread felt a bit like arriving at a party where half the room was sipping non-alcoholic shrubs and the other half had spent the afternoon tailgating in a stadium parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments for a research paper, on ScienceDaily, about the evolutionary factors that may have been responsible for making humans the only mammals prone to heart attacks, a user criticized the study for having been conducted on mice. “Another couch biologist, there’s one in every thread,” posted a second user. “Thanks for all the observations, we really hadn’t thought of any of that, you single-handedly salvaged modern biological research!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gackle stepped in to ask the user not to break the site guidelines, and to behave more in the intended spirit of Hacker News. “Fair enough,” the user wrote; I felt a small rush of triumph, and pride, on Gackle’s behalf. Then, from the user, a follow-up question: “Why is this low-effort criticism of biology allowed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s allowed in the sense that people are allowed to be wrong and/or ignorant because that’s what most of us are on most topics,” Gackle replied. “We can’t stop that any more than King Canute”—the ancient king of the North Sea who demonstrated the limits of his power by trying, in an ironic spirit, to command the sea—“could stop the waves. The important question is, what’s the best way to handle it if we want to have an internet forum that doesn’t suck? Experience teaches that the answer is: the patient supply of correct information by people who do know about a topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about the relentless patience and good faith that this style of moderation work required. I pictured Bell and Gackle as swimmers in a resistance pool, doing slow crawls against the currents of online discourse. I hoped the project of Hacker News was worth the effort. I wondered if their work might show that tech really does need humanism—that better online communities can be built one relationship at a time. Then my eyes moved down the thread, where a third user had left a new comment. It read: “King Canute was supposed to stop the tide, you couch alluder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Advice to my younger self: become allergic to the churn</title>
<link>https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-08-07-advice-to-younger-self</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-08-07-advice-to-younger-self</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 16 I was visited by a man who said he had come from the future. He had traveled twenty years back to 1999 to sit down with me and have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked for an hour or so, and in the end he gave me a few pieces of advice. I have lived by these and they have served me well, and now I dispense this advice to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;become-allergic-to-the-churn&quot;&gt;Become allergic to The Churn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he warned me about the churn, and I have since learned to recognize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Churn is losing a day debugging because a transitive dependency changed a function signature. The Churn is spending a week just to get a project you wrote a year ago to even run. The Churn is rewriting your front-end because a shiny new thing came around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are blind to The Churn. They waste days, weeks, months of their lives without blinking, or worse, they get a perverse sense of achievement because the thing which was working fine works &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Churn is a resource sapping disease, and the first step to recovering from The Churn is to recognize The Churn, the second step is realizing it doesn’t have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a plethora of techniques available to combat The Churn that have been around for decades, but our industry is slave to a hype cycle driven by popularity contests, with little regard for upgrade paths, backward compatibility, and long term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily many people do see The Churn for what it is, and once your doors of perception are cleansed you will learn to recognize these people and the work they do. You will discover vast ecosystems of languages and tools that will go to great lengths not to break what wasn’t broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the olives of technology. Olives aren’t candy, and tasting them the first time isn’t always pleasant, but soon you will develop a taste for them. They have been here since ancient times, and they will remain for centuries to come. They are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, solid, reliable, nutritious. Eat less candy and more olives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;: Clojure, Common Lisp, HTML, Make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-examples&lt;/strong&gt;: JavaScript, Ruby, React-Preact-Vue-Angular-…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;study-the-great-traditions&quot;&gt;Study the Great Traditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then went on to speak about The Great Traditions. These are technologies that have been around for so long they form their own worlds. They are like great philosophical traditions, with foundational documents, and generations of commentaries and derived works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outside looking in they are like alien civilizations, complete with their own languages and cultures, perhaps unlike anything you’ve come across before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined effort and experience that has gone into creating each of these traditions is measured in millenia. These people &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; things. They have &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; things. And when you scratch away the hipster veneer of your technology stack you will find they are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you go about approaching something this vast? First off, don’t rush it, time is on your side. Maybe you are Young and have More Important Things To Do First. That’s fine. These things were here before you, and they will patiently wait until you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible find a mentor, someone to be your shifu and teach you these ancient arts. Stay humble, and let your curiosity guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you learn will be eminently practical in your day to day work, but beyond that you will develop an appreciation for technologies that stand the test of time, and the design, the culture, the principles they are born from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;: UNIX, LISP, The Web, Emacs, TeX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke about many more things in the end, and maybe one day I’ll write about those too. And then he left, mysteriously as he had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now twenty years later, prepping my time machine, I know that person was me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One job, many roles: The different skills needed to be a successful CTO</title>
<link>https://madewithlove.be/one-job-many-roles-the-different-skills-needed-to-be-a-successful-cto/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://madewithlove.be/one-job-many-roles-the-different-skills-needed-to-be-a-successful-cto/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;introduction--big&quot;&gt;Some time ago I came across &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-founding-ceos-dilemma-stay-or-go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article on Harvard Business School’s Working Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; blog about when founding CEOs need to go. It’s from 2005, but it is still just as relevant now. The main takeaway is that you need differently skilled people at the helm in different stages of your company and that this transition is not always easy. They talk about founding CEOs, but this is also true for CTOs, whether they are founders or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Success or failure, you may need a different profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the HBS article, they discuss two situations in which a CEO needs replacement, specifically in an early stage of a smaller company. The obvious scenario is when the founder-CEO is not performing well and the targets aren’t met. But paradoxically, it may also be necessary to replace the founder-CEO if the company is doing exceptionally well. In that case, the CEO has been very successful in the stage the company used to be in, but with such dramatic growth, quick change is needed and that requires a different type of CEO. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-large&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… the fact remains that the challenges a CTO faces change enormously throughout the life of a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This same reasoning can also be applied to CTOs in a digital product company. Whenever bugs pile up, the development team is in chaos or features are constantly almost ready, the CTO is probably not performing well. That is an obvious scenario, but what does the other scenario look like, one where the company is hugely successful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, you need &lt;strong&gt;someone who can get something built quickly&lt;/strong&gt;. That first product should prove the concept, scale a bit to cater the first clients, largely ignoring concerns like stability, security, and scaling. Now imagine your product works: you get traction in the market, people notice you and clients arrive even faster than imagined. Your original CTO has been very successful, but at this point &lt;strong&gt;you need someone who can get your product stable&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;working at scale&lt;/strong&gt;, and with the &lt;strong&gt;security needed&lt;/strong&gt; in this day and age of ever more refined hacking methods. And you need this person fast. If that same person still ticks all the boxes, &lt;strong&gt;you are very lucky&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is, of course, a bit extreme, but the fact remains that the challenges a CTO faces change enormously throughout the life of a company. So which skills do you need at each point? And do you even need a full-time, in-house CTO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From an idea to first growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the start, you need a developer, a hacker&lt;/strong&gt;, someone who knows how to make something that proves your concept and who is skilled enough to make it work for the small user base you will hopefully build up soon. And preferably all of this on a small budget and quickly. This is not a CTO, this is a full-stack developer. They must have a broad skill set, but managing people or a department’s budget, or setting out a technical vision is not needed yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-large&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start, you need a developer, a hacker, someone who knows how to make something that proves your concept and who is skilled enough to make it work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you’re very lucky, this person is you or your co-founder, but realistically you will have a hard time finding someone who is a good hacker and is willing to work for free, which we all know is what co-founding comes down to. Finding someone that is all this and is ready for the next stage, if and when it comes, is several orders of magnitude harder again. So whatever your situation, calling your most talented developer a CTO may very well backfire as soon as your company grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is not to say that there’s no need for strategic thinking. How do you solve this? &lt;strong&gt;A good option is to start off with advisors&lt;/strong&gt; to fill this gap. You could hire an external CTO or find an investor with the right experience, but ideally, you find advisors that have had their own successful start-up that has grown beyond where you’re at now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exponential growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward some time. You’ve built your MVP. Congratulations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://madewithlove.be/the-minimum-viable-product-is-not-so-minimum-anymore/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;this is not a small task (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;this is not a small task&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve added features to your product and people to your team to keep things going. Suddenly there’s success; people are talking about your product and even signing up. You need to scale the product, the infrastructure and the team, all at the same time as dealing with the non-technical challenges this brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your company needs its first full-time CTO. You need &lt;strong&gt;someone with a vision on how to do things and the skills to make it happen&lt;/strong&gt;. A CTO at this point still needs to mainly look inward and know how to code, know the structure of the application and infrastructure, but the focus is shifting towards managing a team, establishing a culture and processes to be able to grow quickly. Growing also means hiring but also making sure that every hire is an effective team member as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-large&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CTO at this point still needs to mainly look inward and know how to code, … but the focus is shifting towards managing a team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With growth come scaling issues. This means your code, however young it may be, will become legacy code, unfit for its current task. A CTO at this point should know how to manage this and know what relevant technology can be used to improve the code base. Managing changes in so many areas is not an easy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you will typically be looking for an extra round of capital. Potential investors will be looking at the team. Your CTO is one of the key people they will evaluate when deciding to invest or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your options? If you have a CTO already, get advisors, mentors or training. You could even temporarily hire an external CTO ad interim to oversee the rapid changes while training your CTO. Don’t take it lightly; don’t assume anyone can just handle this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To multiple teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve managed to grow quickly and not end up in the graveyard. Your product is maturing and has multiple parts, available on multiple platforms. For each of those, there’s a dedicated, multidisciplinary team, with a great number of different function titles that used to be just tasks. Product owners, product managers, engineering managers, technical support, operations, user research, user experience design, and more. This is no longer the tight-knit band of developers working to take over the world. People come and go, hiring is a constant process, people management takes a lot of time now. Scaling issues on a regional scale, security, legislation, a company vision, all of these become important whenever a technical or product decision needs to be made and after a few rounds of investment, the CTO now has clear budget and performance goals to meet, set by a board of directors they regularly meet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-large&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ideal CTO now is a visionary, understanding the technical side and the product, specifically within the sector of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is clearly not the same set of skills as before. A lot more weight is given to &lt;strong&gt;people management, process and structure&lt;/strong&gt;, but still, the technical side of things can not be left to the teams alone. Again a giant leap is needed. If this change comes along slowly, your CTO has the time to adapt, learn new skills, but slow growth is usually seen as bad by investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ideal CTO now is a &lt;strong&gt;visionary&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;understanding the technical side&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;product&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically within the sector of the company. But they are also communicators, with a well developed professional network and the ability to manage upwards, the expectations of the board, and downwards as a manager of managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it is important to not lose touch with the developers, designers, tech support staff, and other technical teams. You’re not a multinational corporation (and even there it helps to keep in touch, but that’s a different subject). Things still move rapidly and changes can be made quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples above are only that, examples. There are as many journeys as there are companies. What I do hope is that these examples illustrate how a CTO’s skills need to adapt over a short time. Look at the difference between the hacker leading a small group in the beginning and the almost-corporate CTO managing multiple teams — this transformation can happen in just a few very busy years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before hiring your first CTO, consider what role this person will fill. What skills do they need and for how long? Will they be able to help you in the next phase too? The required skill set rapidly changes in a quickly changing company. Success or failure, you may need a different CTO.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What has to happen with Unix virtual memory when you have no swap space</title>
<link>https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NoSwapConsequence</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NoSwapConsequence</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/4/15&quot;&gt;Artem S. Tashkinov wrote on the Linux kernel mailing list about a Linux problem under memory pressure&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/qeaofr/linux_kernel_s_inability_gracefully&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;, and threaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/d9802b6a-949b-b327-c4a6-3dbca485ec20@gmx.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The specific reproduction instructions involved having low RAM, turning off swap space, and then putting the system under load, and when that happened (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you hit a situation when opening a new tab requires more RAM than is currently available, the system will stall hard. You will barely be able to move the mouse pointer. &lt;em&gt;Your disk LED will be flashing incessantly (I'm not entirely sure why)&lt;/em&gt;. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid I have bad news for the people snickering at Linux here; if you're running without swap space, you can probably get any Unix to behave this way under memory pressure. If you can't on your particular Unix, I'd actually say that your Unix is probably not letting you get full use out of your RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify a bit, we can divide pages of user memory up into &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; pages and &lt;em&gt;file-backed&lt;/em&gt; pages. File-backed pages are what they sound like; they come from some specific file on the filesystem that they can be written out to (if they're dirty) or read back in from. Anonymous pages are not backed by a file, so the only place they can be written out to and read back in from is swap space. Anonymous pages mostly come from dynamic memory allocations and from modifying the program's global variables and data; file backed pages come mostly from mapping files into memory with &lt;code&gt;mmap()&lt;/code&gt; and also, crucially, from the code and read-only data of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A file backed page can turn into an anonymous page under some circumstances.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, when you have swap space and your system is under memory pressure a Unix kernel will balance evicting anonymous pages out to swap space and evicting file-backed pages back to their source file. However, when you have no swap space, the kernel cannot evict anonymous pages any more; they're stuck in RAM because there's nowhere else to put them. All the kernel can do to reclaim memory is to evict whatever file-backed pages there are, &lt;em&gt;even if these pages are going to be needed again very soon&lt;/em&gt; and will just have to be read back in from the filesystem. If RAM keeps getting allocated for anonymous pages, there is less and less RAM left to hold whatever collection of file-backed pages your system needs to do anything useful and your system will spend more and more time thrashing around reading file-backed pages back in (with your disk LED blinking all of the time). Since one of the sources of file-backed pages is the executable code of all of your programs (and most of the shared libraries they use), it's quite possible to get into a situation where your programs can barely run without taking a page fault for another page of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This frantic eviction of file-backed pages can happen even if you have anonymous pages that are being used only very infrequently and so would normally be immediately pushed out to swap space. With no swap space, anonymous pages are stuck in RAM no matter how infrequently they're touched; the only anonymous pages that can be discarded are ones that have never been written to and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/WhyZeroMemoryPages&quot;&gt;are guaranteed to be all zero&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days, this usually was not very much of an issue because system RAM was generally large compared to the size of programs and thus the amount of file-backed pages that were likely to be in memory. That's no longer the case today; modern large programs such as Firefox and its shared libraries can have significant amounts of file-backed code and data pages (in addition to their often large use of dynamically allocated memory, ie anonymous pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this thrashing can happen in any Unix. To prevent it, your Unix has to decide to deliberately not allow you to allocate more anonymous pages after a certain point, even though it could evict file-backed pages to make room for them. Deciding when to cut your anonymous page allocations off is necessarily a heuristic, and so any Unix that tries to do it is sooner or later going to prevent you from using some of your RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is different than &lt;a href=&quot;https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/MemoryOvercommit&quot;&gt;the usual issue with overcommitting virtual memory address space&lt;/a&gt; because you're not asking for more memory than could theoretically be satisfied. The kernel has to guess how much file-backed memory programs will need in order to perform decently, and it has to do so at the time when you try to allocate anonymous memory since it can't take the memory back later.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Is Locking iPhone Batteries to Discourage Repair</title>
<link>https://www.ifixit.com/News/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ifixit.com/News/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;By activating a dormant software lock on their newest iPhones, Apple is effectively announcing a drastic new policy: only Apple batteries can go in iPhones, and only they can install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you replace the battery in the newest iPhones, a message indicating you need to service your battery appears in Settings &amp;gt; Battery, next to Battery Health. The “Service” message is normally an indication that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207453&quot;&gt;battery is degraded and needs to be replaced&lt;/a&gt;. The message still shows up when you put in a brand new battery, however. Here’s the bigger problem: our lab tests confirmed that even when you swap in a genuine Apple battery, the phone will still display the “Service” message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bug; it’s a feature Apple wants. Unless an Apple Genius or an Apple Authorized Service Provider authenticates a battery to the phone, that phone will never show its battery health and always report a vague, ominous problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07170827/iphone-battery-service.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of &amp;quot;Service&amp;quot; message in the iPhone's Battery Health settings.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-32344&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; srcset=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07170827/iphone-battery-service.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07170827/iphone-battery-service-835x900.jpg 835w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px&quot;/&gt;Our iPhone XS couldn’t verify that our replacement genuine Apple battery was a genuine Apple battery..&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first saw this phenomenon in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nGnAdtTDCw&quot;&gt;damning video from Justin at The Art of Repair&lt;/a&gt;, and we were able to replicate it on an iPhone XS running both iOS 12 and the iOS 13 beta. Swapping in a new genuine Apple battery from another iPhone XS resulted in the “Service” message popping up in the Battery Health section, followed by an “Important Battery Message” telling us that it’s “unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery.” Justin says this only affects the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;The &amp;quot;SERVICE&amp;quot; issue in XR XS &amp;amp; XS Max Batteries | is APPLE taking part lock down TOO FAR?&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nGnAdtTDCw?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Apple is locking batteries to their iPhones at the factory, so whenever you replace the battery yourself—even if you’re using a genuine Apple battery from another iPhone—it will still give you the “Service” message. The only way around this is—you guessed it—paying Apple money to replace your iPhone battery for you. Presumably, their internal diagnostic software can flip the magic bit that resets this “Service” indicator. But Apple refuses to make this software available to anyone but themselves and Apple Authorized Service Providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friend Justin notes that there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq27546-g1.pdf&quot;&gt;Texas Instruments microcontroller&lt;/a&gt; on the battery itself that provides information to the iPhone, such as battery capacity, temperature, and how much time until it fully discharges. Apple uses its own proprietary version, but pretty much all smartphone batteries have some version of this chip. The chip used in newer iPhone batteries includes an authentication feature that stores the info for pairing the battery to the iPhone’s logic board. In simple terms, if the battery doesn’t have the unique authentication key the iPhone’s logic board is expecting, you’ll get that “Service” message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Documentation of TI's microcontroller responsible for the locking of iPhone batteries.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-32345&quot; srcset=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc.jpg 1751w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171011/ti-chip-doc-1200x800.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1751px) 100vw, 1751px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Is a User-Hostile Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because a silicon part has a feature doesn’t mean Apple must use it. For years, iPod audio chipsets included AM/FM capabilities that Apple never utilized. This “Service” indicator is the equivalent of a “Check Oil” light that only a Ford dealership can reset, even if you change the oil yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, it is possible to remove the microcontroller chip from the original battery and carefully solder it into the new battery you’re swapping in, restoring the Battery Health feature—but the procedure isn’t for the faint of heart, and it’s an unreasonable requirement for any repair, much less something as simple as a battery swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Swapping in another genuine Apple battery into an iPhone XS&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-32346&quot; srcset=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171051/iphone_xs_testing_featured-1200x800.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, your replacement battery will continue to work perfectly fine, and you’ll get all of the benefits that come with a new battery—we’ve confirmed that this doesn’t throttle the iPhone’s performance on a healthy battery, for example. But you won’t be able to easily see your battery’s health and know when it’s time to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, this is a huge problem for iPhone owners who may not know about this new, sneaky lockdown, and it will undoubtedly cause confusion: they’ll replace their own battery and notice the “Service” message, then begin troubleshooting a problem that isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Is Hiding Your Battery’s Health Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, as of iOS 10 Apple has blocked third-party battery health apps from accessing most of the battery’s details, including cycle count, which is critical information that tells you whether or not your battery is on the brink of degradation. You can get around this, however, by plugging your iPhone into a Mac and installing a Mac app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/&quot;&gt;coconutBattery&lt;/a&gt;. It will show battery health statistics even if your iPhone refuses to show this info in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing trend, and Apple is making repair increasingly difficult. Back in 2016, they completely bricked iPhones that had been previously repaired, displaying an opaque &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/News/whats-up-with-error-53&quot;&gt;”Error 53” if you replaced your Touch ID home button&lt;/a&gt;, since they’re paired to the logic board. In fact, DIY home button replacement will still result in Touch ID functionality completely ceasing to exist. More recently, Apple started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/News/11-3-update-breaking-iphone-screens&quot;&gt;disabling TrueTone on replacement screens&lt;/a&gt;, even if you’re using a genuine Apple screen. Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An iPhone XS showing a &amp;quot;Service&amp;quot; message when another genuine Apple battery is swapped in.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-32347&quot; srcset=&quot;https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2019/08/07171316/iphone_xs_service-1200x800.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of behavior proves, once again, that Apple is out to stop all repairs performed by anyone except Apple themselves. The company claims that using third-party components can compromise the integrity of an iPhone’s functionality, but when genuine Apple parts have the same problem, then clearly it’s not really about third-party components at all: it’s about preventing you from having any autonomy with a device you supposedly own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bought it, you own it, you should be able to fix it. It’s that simple. Pairing batteries to iPhones is a gross overreach. It’s yet another instance of purchasing a product, and not being able to fully utilize it—like leasing a car, except you’re paying full price for it.&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, this is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://repair.org/&quot;&gt;Right to Repair&lt;/a&gt; legislation can step in and save the day. It’s trivial for manufacturers to lock down parts and tie them together, making it easy for them to prevent anyone repairing a device other than themselves for the sake of profits. Let’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://repair.org/stand-up&quot;&gt;do something about it&lt;/a&gt;: call your representatives and go to their town halls—state legislators are in recess and visiting their districts. They would love to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
