&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is an expanded version of the story that appears in our February, 2020 print magazine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A live-action &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; television series was George Lucas’ dream for many years, but the logistics of television production made achieving the necessary scope and scale seem inconceivable. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans would expect exotic, picturesque locations, but it simply wasn’t plausible to take a crew to the deserts of Tunisia or the salt flats of Bolivia on a short schedule and limited budget. The creative team behind &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; has solved that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/aOC8E8z_ifw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, green- and bluescreen compositing was the go-to solution for bringing fantastic environments and actors together on the screen. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic&lt;/a&gt; did pioneering work with the technology for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/articles/beyond-the-frame-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the original &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt;.) However, when characters are wearing highly reflective costumes, as is the case with Mando (Pedro Pascal), the title character of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/the-mandalorian&quot;&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the reflection of green- and bluescreen in the wardrobe causes costly problems in post-production. In addition, it’s challenging for actors to perform in a “sea of blue,” and for key creatives to have input on shot designs and composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/asc-sw.jpg?mtime=20200204135810&quot; alt=&quot;AC, Feb. 2020&quot; title=&quot;AC, Feb. 2020&quot; width=&quot;210&quot;/&gt;This story was originally published in the Feb. 2020 issue of AC. Some images are additional or alternate.
&lt;p&gt;In order for &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; to work, technology had to advance enough that the epic worlds of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;could be rendered on an affordable scale by a team whose actual production footprint would comprise a few soundstages and a small backlot. An additional consideration was that the typical visual-effects workflow runs concurrent with production, and then extends for a lengthy post period. Even with all the power of contemporary digital visual-effects techniques and billions of computations per second, the process can take up to 12 hours or more per frame. With thousands of shots and multiple iterations, this becomes a time-consuming endeavor. The Holy Grail of visual effects — and a necessity for &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, according to co-cinematographer and co-producer &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/blog/parallax-view/greig-fraser-asc-acs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Greig Fraser, ASC, ACS&lt;/a&gt; — was the ability to do real-time, in-camera compositing on set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was our goal,” says Fraser, who had previously explored the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy while shooting &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/blog/the-film-book/rogue-one-set-visit-with-greig-fraser-asc-acs-part-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt; Feb. ’17).  “We wanted to create an environment that was conducive not just to giving a composition line-up to the effects, but to actually capturing them in real time, photo-real and in-camera, so that the actors were in that environment in the right lighting — all at the moment of photography.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was what might be described as the heir to rear projection — a dynamic, real-time, photo-real background played back on a massive LED video wall and ceiling, which not only provided the pixel-accurate representation of exotic background content, but was also rendered with correct camera positional data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-001920.jpg?mtime=20200205210621&quot; width=&quot;3834&quot;/&gt;Mando with the Child on his ship.
&lt;p&gt;If the content was created in advance of the shoot, then photographing actors, props and set pieces in front of this wall could create final in-camera visual effects — or “near” finals, with only technical fixes required, and with complete creative confidence in the composition and look of the shots. On &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, this space was dubbed “the Volume.” (Technically, a “volume” is any space defined by motion-capture technology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept was initially proposed by Kim Libreri of Epic Games while he was at Lucasfilm and it has become the basis of the technology that “Holy Grail” that makes a live-action &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; television series possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, as &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; was ramping up, the concept of real-time compositing was once again discussed. Technology had matured to a new level. Visual effects supervisor John Knoll had an early discussion with Fraser about this concept and the cinematographer brought up the notion of utilizing a large LED screen as a lighting instrument to incorporate interactive animated lighting on the actors and sets during composite photography utilizing playback of rough previsualized effects on the LED screens. The final animated VFX would be added in later; the screens were merely to provide interactive lighting to match the animations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the big problems of shooting blue- and greenscreen composite photography is the interactive lighting,” offers Fraser. “Often, you're shooting real photography elements before the backgrounds are created and you're imagining what the interactive lighting will do — and then you have to hope that what you've done on set will match what happens in post much later on. If the director changes the backgrounds in post, then the lighting isn't going to match and the final shot will feel false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/imager/cms-assets_theasc_com/Mandolorian-Filoni-Fraser-and-Baz-Iodine_248ed78b6649d6cda0fcadc1ac9bc23e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Director and executive producer Dave Filoni and cinematographers Greig Fraser, ASC, ACS (center) and Barry “Baz” Idoine (operating camera) on the set.&quot;/&gt; Director and executive producer Dave Filoni and cinematographers Greig Fraser, ASC, ACS (center) and Barry “Baz” Idoine (operating camera) on the set.

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, they built a large cylindrical LED screen and created all of the backgrounds in advance for the space battle landings on Scarif, Jedha and Eadu and all the cockpit sequences in X-Wing and U-Wing spacecraft were done in front of that LED wall as the primary source of illumination on the characters and sets. Those LED panels had a pixel pitch of 9mm (the distance between the centers of the RGB pixel clusters on the screen). Unfortunately, with the size of the pixel pitch, they could rarely get it far enough away from the camera to avoid moiré and make the image appear photo-real, so it was used purely for lighting purposes. However, because the replacement backgrounds were already built and utilized on set — the comps were extremely successful and perfectly matched the dynamic lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy approached writer/director Jon Favreau about a potential project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-3_HUC-003895_FD.jpg?mtime=20200205150512&quot; width=&quot;6326&quot;/&gt; A fisheye view looking through the gap between the two back walls of the show’s LED-wall system, known as “the Volume.” The dark spot on the Volume ceiling is due to a different model of LED screens used there. The ceiling is mostly used for lighting purposes, and if seen on camera is replaced in post.
&lt;p&gt;“I went to see Jon and ask him if we would like to do something for Disney’s new streaming service,” Kennedy says. “I’ve known that Jon has wanted to do a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; project for a long time, so we started talking right away about what he could do that would push technology and that led to a whole conversation around what could change the production path; what could actually create a way in which we could make things differently?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favreau had just completed &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; and was embarking on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/articles/making-the-lion-king&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Lion King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for Disney — both visual-effects heavy films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual effects supervisor Richard Bluff and executive creative director and head of ILM Rob Bredow showed Favreau a number of tests that ILM had conducted including the technology of the LED wall from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;. Fraser suggested with the advancements in LED technology since &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; that this project could leverage new panels and push the envelope on real-time, in-camera visual effects. Favreau loved the concept and decided that was the production path to take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-4_HUC-003903_R.jpg?mtime=20200205151035&quot; width=&quot;5834&quot;/&gt;In the background, appearing to float in space, are the motion-tracking cameras peeking between the Volume’s wall and ceiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-5_HUC-003923_FD.jpg?mtime=20200205151815&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production was looking to minimize the amount of green- and bluescreen photography and requirements of post compositing to improve the quality of the environment for the actors. The LED screen provides a convincing facsimile of a real set/location and avoids the green void that can be challenging for performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was very encouraged by my experiences using similar technology on &lt;em&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/magazine-issues/may-2016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt;, May ’16&lt;/a&gt;], and using virtual cameras on &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt;, Aug. ’19],” explains Favreau, series creator and executive producer. “I had also experimented with a partial video wall for the pilot episode of &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;. With the team we had assembled between our crew, ILM, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magnopus.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Magnopus&lt;/a&gt;, Epic Games, Profile Studios and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luxmc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lux Machina&lt;/a&gt;, I felt that we had a very good chance at a positive outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Volume is a difficult technology to understand until you stand there in front of the ‘projection’ on the LED screen, put an actor in front of it, and move the camera around,” Fraser says. “It’s hard to grasp. It’s not really rear projection; it’s not a TransLite because [it is a real-time, interactive image with 3D objects] and has the proper parallax; and it’s photo-real, not animated, but it is generated through a gaming engine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-6_HUC-003595_R.jpg?mtime=20200205151745&quot; width=&quot;5944&quot;/&gt;Idoine (left) shooting on the Volume’s display of the ice-planet Maldo Kreis — one of many of the production’s environment “loads” — with director Filoni watching and Karina Silva operating B camera. The fixtures with white, half-dome, ping-pong-style balls on each camera are the “Sputniks” — infrared-marker configurations that are seen by the motion-tracking cameras to record the production camera’s position in 3D space, and to render proper 3D parallax on the Volume wall.
&lt;p&gt;“The technology that we were able to innovate on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; would not have been possible had we not developed technologies around the challenges of &lt;em&gt;Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;,” offers Favreau. “We had used game-engine and motion-capture [technology] and real-time set extension that had to be rendered after the fact, so real-time render was a natural extension of this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry “Baz” Idoine, who worked with Fraser for several years as a camera operator and second-unit cinematographer on features including &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/magazine-issues/january-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt; Jan. ’19&lt;/a&gt;), assumed cinematography duties on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; when Fraser stepped away to shoot Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. Idoine observes, “The strong initial value is that you’re not shooting in a green-screen world and trying to emulate the light that will be comped in later — you’re actually shooting finished product shots. It gives the control of cinematography back to the cinematographer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volume was a curved, 20'-high-by-180'-circumference LED video wall, comprising 1,326 individual LED screens of a 2.84mm pixel pitch that created a 270-degree semicircular background with a 75'-diameter performance space topped with an LED video ceiling, which was set directly onto the main curve of the LED wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the rear of the Volume, in the 90 remaining degrees of open area, essentially “behind camera,” were two 18'-high-by-20'-wide flat panels of 132 more LED screens. These two panels were rigged to traveler track and chain motors in the stage’s perms, so the walls could be moved into place or flown out of the way to allow better access to the Volume area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Volume allows us to bring many different environments under one roof,” says visual-effects supervisor Richard Bluff of ILM. “We could be shooting on the lava flats of Nevarro in the morning and in the deserts of Tatooine in the afternoon. Of course, there are practical considerations to switching over environments, but we [typically did] two environments in one day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/imager/cms-assets_theasc_com/Mandolorian-13_HUC-008868_248ed78b6649d6cda0fcadc1ac9bc23e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The crew surrounds the Mandalorian’s spacecraft Razor Crest. Only the fuselage and cockpit are practical set pieces. From this still-camera position, the composition appears “broken,” but from the production camera's perspective, the engines appear in perfect relationship to the fuselage, and track in parallax with the camera’s movement.&quot;/&gt; The crew surrounds the Mandalorian’s spacecraft Razor Crest.

&lt;div class=&quot;tier centered-block&quot; readability=&quot;96.156021356535&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A majority of the shots were done completely in camera,” Favreau adds. “And in cases where we didn’t get to final pixel, the postproduction process was shortened significantly because we had already made creative choices based on what we had seen in front of us. Postproduction was mostly refining creative choices that we were not able to finalize on the set in a way that we deemed photo-real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With traditional rear projection (and front projection), in order for the result to look believable, the camera must either remain stationary or move along a preprogrammed path to match the perspective of the projected image. In either case, the camera’s center of perspective (the entrance pupil of the lens, sometimes referred to — though incorrectly — as the nodal point) must be precisely aligned with the projection system to achieve proper perspective and the effects of parallax. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; is hardly the first production to incorporate an image-projection system for in-camera compositing, but what sets its technique apart is its ability to facilitate a moving camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-003984.jpg?mtime=20200205153301&quot; width=&quot;6720&quot;/&gt;In the pilot episode, the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) brings his prey (Horatio Sanz) into custody.
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, using a stationary camera or one locked into a pre-set move for all of the work in the Volume was simply not acceptable for the needs of this particular production. The team therefore had to find a way to track the camera’s position and movement in real-world space, and extrapolate proper perspective and parallax on the screen as the camera moved. This required incorporating motion-capture technology and a videogame engine — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Epic Games’ Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt; — that would generate proper 3D parallax perspective in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations depicted on the LED wall were initially modeled in rough form by visual-effects artists creating 3D models in Maya, to the specs determined by production designer Andrew Jones and visual consultant Doug Chiang. Then, wherever possible, a photogrammetry team would head to an actual location and create a 3D photographic scan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We realized pretty early on that the best way to get photo-real content on the screen was to photograph something,” attests Visual Effects Supervisor Richard Bluff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As amazing and advanced as the Unreal Engine’s capabilities were, rendering fully virtual polygons on-the-fly didn’t produce the photo-real result that the filmmakers demanded. In short, 3-D computer-rendered sets and environments were not photo-realistic enough to be utilized as in-camera final images. The best technique was to create the sets virtually, but then incorporate photographs of real-world objects, textures and locations and map those images onto the 3-D virtual objects. This technique is commonly known as tiling or photogrammetry. This is not necessarily a unique or new technique, but the incorporation of photogrammetry elements achieved the goal of creating in-camera finals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-000556.jpg?mtime=20200205154002&quot; width=&quot;3832&quot;/&gt;The Mandolorian makes repairs with a rich landscape displayed behind him.
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, photographic “scanning” of a location, which incorporates taking thousands of photographs from many different viewpoints to generate a 3-D photographic model, is a key component in creating the virtual environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrico Damm became the Environment Supervisor for the production and led the scanning and photogrammetry team that would travel to locations such as Iceland and Utah to shoot elements for the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect weather condition for these photographic captures is a heavily overcast day, as there are little to no shadows on the landscape. A situation with harsh sunlight and hard shadows means that it cannot easily be re-lit in the virtual world. In those cases, software such as Agisoft De-Lighter was used to analyze the photographs for lighting and remove shadows to result in a more neutral canvas for virtual lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scanning is a faster, looser process than photogrammetry and it is done from multiple positions and viewpoints. For scanning, the more parallax introduced, the better the software can resolve the 3-D geometry. Damm created a custom rig where the scanner straps six cameras to their body which all fire simultaneously as the scanner moves about the location. This allows them to gather six times the images in the same amount of time — about 1,800 on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photogrammetry is used to create virtual backdrops and images must be shot on a nodal rig to eliminate parallax between the photos. For &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, about 30-40% of the Volume’s backdrops were created via virtual backdrops — photogrammetry images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each phase of photography — photogrammetry and scanning — needs to be done at various times during the day to capture different looks to the landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar scanning systems are sometimes also employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cameras used for scanning were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5d-mark-iv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canon EOS 5D MKIV&lt;/a&gt; and EOS 5DS with prime lenses. Zooms are sometimes incorporated as modern stitching software has gotten better about solving multiple images from different focal lengths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/imager/cms-assets_theasc_com/Mandolorian-8_HUC-FF-000178_248ed78b6649d6cda0fcadc1ac9bc23e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; The Mandalorian (aka “Mando,” played by Pedro Pascal) treks through the desert alone. &quot;/&gt; The Mandalorian (aka “Mando,” played by Pedro Pascal) treks through the desert alone.
&lt;div class=&quot;tier centered-block&quot; readability=&quot;121&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information was mapped onto 3D virtual sets and then modified or embellished as necessary to adhere to the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; design aesthetic. If there wasn’t a real-world location to photograph, the environments were created entirely by ILM’s “environments” visual-effects team. The elements of the locations were loaded into the Unreal Engine video game platform, which provided a live, real-time, 3D environment that could react to the camera’s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third shot of Season 1’s first episode demonstrates this technology with extreme effectiveness. The shot starts with a low angle of Mando reading a sensor on the icy planet of Maldo Kreis; he stands on a long walkway that stretches out to a series of structures on the horizon. The skies are full of dark clouds, and a light snow swirls around. Mando walks along the trail toward the structures, and the camera booms up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was captured in the Volume, in-camera and in real time. Part of the walkway was a real, practical set, but the rest of the world was the virtual image on the LED screen, and the parallax as the camera boomed up matched perfectly with the real set. The effect of this system is seamless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the enormous amount of processing power needed to create this kind of imagery, the full 180' screen and ceiling could not be rendered high-resolution, photo-real in real time. The compromise was to enter the specific lens used on the camera into the system, so that it rendered a photo-real, high-resolution image based on the camera’s specific field of view at that given moment, while the rest of the screen displayed a lower-resolution image that was still effective for interactive lighting and reflections on the talent, props and physical sets. (The simpler polygon count facilitated faster rendering times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-9_HUC-032597.jpg?mtime=20200205204101&quot; width=&quot;6000&quot;/&gt;Idoine (far left) discusses a shot of “the Child” (aka “Baby Yoda”) with director Rick Famuyiwa (third from left) and series creator/executive producer Jon Favreau (third from right), while assistant director Kim Richards (second from right, standing) and crewmembers listen. Practical set design was often used in front of the LED screen, and was designed to visually bridge the gap between the real and virtual space. The practical sets were frequently placed on risers to lift the floor and better hide the seam of the LED wall and stage floor.
&lt;p&gt;Each Volume load was put into the Unreal Engine video game platform, which provided the live, real-time, 3D environment that reacted to the production camera’s position — which was tracked by Profile Studios’ motion-capture system via infrared (IR) cameras surrounding the top of the LED walls that monitored the IR markers mounted to the production camera. When the system recognized the X, Y, Z position of the camera, it then rendered proper 3D parallax for the camera’s position in real time. That was fed from Profile into ILM’s proprietary StageCraft software, which managed and recorded the information and full production workflow as it, in turn, fed the images into the Unreal Engine. The images were then output to the screens with the assistance of the Lux Machina team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes 11 interlinked computers to serve the images to the wall. Three processors are dedicated to real-time rendering and four servers provide three 4K images seamlessly side-by-side on the wall and one 4K image on the ceiling. That delivers an image size of 12,288 pixels wide by 2,160 high on the wall and 4,096 x 2,160 on the ceiling. With that kind of imagery, however, the full 270 degrees (plus movable back LED walls) and ceiling cannot be rendered high-resolution photo-real in real time. The compromise is to enter in the specific lens used on the camera into the system so that it renders a photo-real high-resolution image only for the camera's specific field of view at that given moment while the rest of the screen displays a lower-resolution image that is perfectly effective for interactive lighting and reflections on the talent, props and physical sets, but of a simpler polygon count for faster rendering times.&lt;/p&gt;

The rocks behind him are on the LED wall, while some practical rocks are placed in the mid- and foreground to blend the transition. The floor of the stage is covered in mud and rocks for this location. On the jib is an Arri Alexa LF with a Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic lens.
&lt;p&gt;Due to the 10-12 frames (roughly half a second) of latency from the time Profile’s system received camera-position information to Unreal’s rendering of the new position on the LED wall, if the camera moved ahead of the rendered frustum (a term defining the virtual field of view of the camera) on the screen, the transition line between the high-quality perspective render window and the lower-quality main render would be visible. To avoid this, the frustum was projected an average of 40-percent larger than the actual field of view of the camera/lens combination, to allow some safety margin for camera moves. In some cases, if the lens’ field of view — and therefore the frustum — was too wide, the system could not render an image high-res enough in real time; the production would then use the image on the LED screen simply as lighting, and composite the image in post [with a greenscreen added behind the actors]. In those instances, the backgrounds were already created, and the match was seamless because those actual backgrounds had been used at the time of photography [to light the scene].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, says Fraser, Favreau wanted &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; to have a visual aesthetic that would match that of the original &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. This meant a more “grounded” camera, with slow pans and tilts, and non-aggressive camera moves — an aesthetic that helped to hide the system latency. “In addition to using some of the original camera language in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Jon is deeply inspired by old Westerns and samurai films, so he also wanted to borrow a bit from those, especially Westerns,” Fraser notes. “&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; is, in essence, a gunslinger, and he’s very methodical. This gave us a set of parameters that helped define the look of the show. At no point will you see an 8mm fisheye lens in someone’s face. That just doesn’t work within this language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was also of paramount importance to me that the result of this technology not just be ‘suitable for TV,’ but match that of major, high-end motion pictures,” Fraser continues. “We had to push the bar to the point where no one would really know we were using new technology; they would just accept it as is. Amazingly, we were able to do just that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arri.com/en/camera-systems/cameras/alexa-lf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arri’s Alexa LF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; was the maiden voyage for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.panavision.com/products/ultra-vista&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Panavision’s full-frame Ultra Vista 1.65x anamorphic lenses&lt;/a&gt;. The 1.65x anamorphic squeeze allowed for full utilization of the 1.44:1 aspect ratio of the LF to create a 2.37:1 native aspect ratio, which was only slightly cropped to 2.39:1 for exhibition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We chose the LF for a couple reasons,” explains Fraser. “&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; has a long history of anamorphic photography, and that aspect ratio is really key. We tested spherical lenses and cropping to 2.40, but it didn’t feel right. It felt very contemporary, not like the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; we grew up with. Additionally, the LF’s larger sensor changes the focal length of the lens that we use for any given shot to a longer lens and reduces the overall depth of field. The T2.3 of the Ultra Vistas is more like a T0.8 in Super 35, so with less depth of field, it was easier to put the LED screen out of focus faster, which avoided a lot of issues with moiré. It allows the inherent problems in a 2D screen displaying 3D images to fall off in focus a lot faster, so the eye can’t tell that those buildings that appear to be 1,000 feet away are actually being projected on a 2D screen only 20 feet from the actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-15_HUC-010046.jpg?mtime=20200205205417&quot; width=&quot;6000&quot;/&gt;Fraser operates an Alexa LF, shooting a close-up of the Ugnaught Kuiil (Misty Rosas in the suit, voiced by Nick Nolte). The transition between the bottom of the LED wall and the stage floor is clearly seen here. That area was often obscured by physical production design or replaced in post.
&lt;p&gt;“The Ultra Vistas were a great choice for us because they have a good amount of character and softness,” Fraser continues. “Photographing the chrome helmet on Mando is a challenge — its super-sharp edges can quickly look video-like if the lens is too sharp. Having a softer acutance in the lens, which [Panavision senior vice president of optical engineering and ASC associate] Dan Sasaki [modified] for us, really helped. The lens we used for Mando tended to be a little too soft for human faces, so we usually shot Mando wide open, compensating for that with ND filters, and shot people 2⁄3 stop or 1 stop closed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Idoine, the production used 50mm, 65mm, 75mm, 100mm, 135mm, 150mm and 180mm Ultra Vistas that range from T2 to T2.8, and he and Fraser tended to expose at T2.5-T3.5. “Dan Sasaki gave us two prototype Ultra Vistas to test in June 2018,” he says, “and from that we worked out what focal-length range to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our desire for cinematic imagery drove every choice,” Idoine adds. And that included the incorporation of a LUT emulating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kodak.com/uploadedfiles/motion/Kodak/motion/Products/Camera_Films/Color_Negative/Product_Info/KODAK_500T_5230-7230_Product_Info.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kodak’s short-lived 500T 5230 color negative&lt;/a&gt;, a favorite of Fraser’s. “I used that stock on &lt;em&gt;Killing Them Softly&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt; Oct. ’12] and &lt;em&gt;Foxcatcher&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt; Dec. ’14], and I just loved its creamy shadows and the slight magenta cast in the highlights,” says Fraser. “For &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, ILM was able to develop a LUT that emulated it, and I’ve been using that LUT ever since.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Foxcatcher&lt;/em&gt; was the last film I shot on the stock, and then Kodak discontinued it,” continues Fraser. “At the time, we had some stock left over and I asked the production if we could donate it to an Australian film student and they said ‘yes,’ so we sent several boxes to Australia. When I was prepping &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, I decided that was the look I wanted — this 5230 stock — but it was gone. On a long shot, I wrote an email to the film student to see if he had any stock left and, unbelievably, he had 50 feet in the bottom of his fridge. I had him send that directly to ILM and they created a LUT from it that I used on &lt;em&gt;Rogue&lt;/em&gt; and now &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-16_HUC-FF-000182.jpg?mtime=20200205210447&quot; width=&quot;3840&quot;/&gt;Actor Giancarlo Esposito as Moff Gideon, an Imperial searching for the Child.
&lt;p&gt;A significant key to the Volume’s success creating in-camera final VFX is color matching the wall’s LED output with the color matrix of the Arri Alexa LF camera. ILM’s Matthias Scharfenberg, J. Schulte and their team did thorough testing of the Black Roe LED capabilities and matching that with the color sensitivity and reproduction of the LF to make them seamless partners. LEDs are very narrow band color spectrum emitters, their red, green and blue diodes output very narrow spectra of color for each diode which makes reaching some colors very difficult and further making them compatible with the color filter array on the ALEV-III was a bit of a challenge. Utilizing a carefully designed series of color patches, a calibration sequence was run on the LED wall to sync with the camera’s sensitivity. This means any other model of camera shooting on the Volume will not receive proper color, but the Alexa LF will. While the color reproduction of the LEDs may not have looked right to the eye, through the camera, it appeared seamless. This means that the off-the-shelf LED panels won’t quite work with the accuracy necessary for a high-end production, but, with custom tweaking, they were successful. There were limitations, however. With low light backgrounds, the screens would block up and alias in the shadows making them unsuitable for in-camera finals — although with further development of the color science this has been solved for season two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant asset to the LED Volume wall and images projected from it is the interactive lighting provided on the actors, sets and props within the Volume. The light that is projected from the imagery on the LED wall provides a realistic sense of the actor (or set/props) being within that environment in a way that is rarely achievable with green- or bluescreen composite photography. If the sun is low on the horizon on the LED wall, the position of the sun on the wall will be significantly brighter than the surrounding sky. This brighter spot will create a bright highlight on the actors and objects in the Volume just as a real sun would from that position. Reflections of elements of the environment from the walls and ceiling show up in Mando’s costume as if he were actually in that real-world location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you’re dealing with a reflective subject like Mando, the world outside the camera frame is often more important than the world you see in the camera’s field of view,” Fraser says. “What’s behind the camera is reflected in the actor’s helmet and costume, and that’s crucial to selling the illusion that he’s in that environment. Even if we were only shooting in one direction on a particular location, the virtual art-department would have to build a 360-degree set so we could get the interactive lighting and reflections right. This was also true for practical sets that were built onstage and on the backlot — we had to build the areas that we would never see on camera because they would be reflected in the suit. In the Volume, it’s this world outside the camera that defines the lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you think about it, unless it’s a practical light in shot, all of our lighting is outside the frame — that’s how we make movies,” Fraser continues. “But when most of your lighting comes from the environment, you have to shape that environment carefully. We sometimes have to add a practical or a window into the design, which provides our key light even though we never see that [element] on camera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-000712.jpg?mtime=20200205211324&quot; width=&quot;3840&quot;/&gt;The fight with the mudhorn likely negated any worry about helmet reflections for this scene.
&lt;p&gt;The interactive lighting of the Volume also significantly reduces the requirement for traditional film production lighting equipment and crew. The light emitted from the LED screens becomes the primary lighting on the actors, sets and props within the Volume. Since this light comes from a virtual image of the set or location, the organic nature of the quality of the light on the elements within the Volume firmly ground those elements into the reality presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were, of course, limitations. Although LEDs are bright and capable of emitting a good deal of light, they cannot re-create the intensity and quality of direct, natural daylight. “The sun on the LED screen looks perfect because it’s been photographed, but it doesn’t look good on the subjects — they look like they’re in a studio,” Fraser attests. “It’s workable for close-ups, but not really for wide shots. For moments with real, direct sunlight, we headed out to the backlot as much as possible.” That “backlot” was an open field near the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manhattanbeachstudios.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manhattan Beach Studios&lt;/a&gt; stages, where the art department built various sets. (Several stages were used for creating traditional sets as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcast skies, however, proved a great source in the Volume. The skies for each “load” — the term given for each new environment loaded onto the LED walls — were based on real, photographed skies. While shooting a location, the photogrammetry team shot multiple stills at different times of day to create “sky domes.” This enabled the director and cinematographer to choose the sun position and sky quality for each set. “We can create a perfect environment where you have two minutes to sunset frozen in time for an entire 10-hour day,” Idoine notes. “If we need to do a turnaround, we merely rotate the sky and background, and we’re ready to shoot!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-18_HUC-001950_R.jpg?mtime=20200205211831&quot; width=&quot;5503&quot;/&gt;Idoine (seated at camera) in discussion with Favreau and Filoni on a practical set.
&lt;p&gt;During prep, Fraser and Idoine spent a lot of time in the virtual art department, whose crew created the virtual backgrounds for the LED loads. They spent many hours going through each load to set sky-dome choices and pick the perfect time of day and sun position for each moment. They could select the sky condition they wanted, adjust the scale and the orientation, and finesse all of these attributes to find the best lighting for the scene. Basic, real-time ray tracing helped them see the effects of their choices on the virtual actors in the previs scene. These choices would then be saved and sent off to ILM, whose artists would use these rougher assets for reference and build the high-resolution digital assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virtual Art Department starts their job creating 3-D virtual sets of each location to production designer Andrew Jones’ specifications and then the director and cinematographer can go into the virtual location with VR headsets and do a virtual scout. Digital actors, props and sets are added and can be moved about and coverage is chosen during the virtual scout. Then the cinematographer will follow the process as the virtual set gets further textured with photogrammetry elements and the sky domes are added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual world on the LED screen is fantastic for many uses, but obviously an actor cannot walk through the screen, so an open doorway doesn't work when it's virtual. Doors are an aspect of production design that have to be physical. If a character walks through a door, it can’t be virtual, it must be real as the actor can’t walk through the LED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-003402_R.jpg?mtime=20200205212735&quot; width=&quot;5852&quot;/&gt;Favreau gets his western-style saloon entrance from the first episode of &lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an actor is close to a set piece, it is more often preferred that piece be physical instead of virtual. If they’re close to a wall, that should be a physical wall so that they are actually close to something real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many objects that are physical are also virtual. Even if a prop or set piece is physically constructed, it is scanned and incorporated into the virtual world so that it becomes not only a practical asset, but a digital one as well. Once it’s in the virtual world, it can be turned on or off on a particular set or duplicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We take objects that the art department have created and we employ photogrammetry on each item to get them into the game engine,” explains Clint Spillers, Virtual Production Supervisor. “We also keep the thing that we scanned and we put it in front of the screen and we’ve had remarkable success getting the foreground asset and the digital object to live together very comfortably.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tier centered-block&quot; readability=&quot;92&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge on production design is the concept that every set must be executed in full 360 degrees. While in traditional filmmaking a production designer may be tempted to shortcut a design knowing that the camera will only see a small portion of a particular set, in this world the set that is off camera is just as important as the set that is seen on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a big revelation for us early on,” attests production designer Andrew Jones. “We were, initially, thinking of this technology as a backdrop — like an advanced translight or painted backdrop — that we would shoot against and hope to get in-camera final effects. We imagined that we would design our sets as you would on a normal film: IE, the camera sees over here, so this is what we need to build. In early conversations with DP Greig Fraser he explained that the off-camera portion of the set — that might never be seen on camera — was just as vital to the effect. The whole Volume is a light box and what is behind the camera is reflected on the actor’s faces, costumes, props. What’s behind the camera is actually the key lighting on the talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-000195_A.jpg?mtime=20200205213251&quot; width=&quot;3840&quot;/&gt;IG-88 and Mando encounter their target.
&lt;p&gt;“This concept radically changed how we approach the sets,” Jones continues. “Anything you put in The Volume is lit by the environment, so we have to make sure that we conceptualize and construct the virtual set in its entirety of every location in full 360. Since the actor is, in essence, a chrome ball, he’s reflecting what is all around him so every detail needs to be realized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sometimes used photogrammetry as the basis, but always relied upon the same visual-effects artists who create environments for the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films to realize these real-time worlds — “baking in” lighting choices established earlier in the pipeline with high-end, ray-traced rendering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I chose the sky domes that worked best for all the shots we needed for each sequence on the Volume,” Fraser notes. “After they were chosen and ILM had done their work, I couldn’t raise or lower the sun because the lighting and shadows would be baked in, but I could turn the whole world to adjust where the hot spot was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser noted a limitation of the adjustments that can be made to the sky domes once they’re live on the Volume after ILM’s finalization. The world can be rotated and the center position can be changed; the intensity and color can be adjusted, but the actual position of the sun in the sky dome can’t be altered because ILM has done the ray tracing ahead of time and “baked” in the shadows of the terrain by the sun position. This is done to minimize the computations necessary to do advanced ray tracing in real time. If the chosen position changes, those baked-in shadows won’t change, only the elements that are reserved for real-time rendering and simple ray tracing will be affected. This would make the backgrounds look false and fake as the lighting direction wouldn’t match the baked-in shadows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-000164.jpg?mtime=20200205213544&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time, traditional lighting fixtures were added to augment the output of the Volume. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth episode, the Mandalorian is looking to lay low and travels to the remote farming planet of Sorgan and visits the common house, which is a thatched, basket-weave structure. The actual common house was a miniature built by the art department and then photographed to be included in the virtual world. The miniature was lit with a single, hard light source that emulated natural daylight breaking through the thatched walls. “You could clearly see that one side of the common house was in hard light and the other side was in shadow,” recalls Idoine. “There were hot spots in the model that really looked great so we incorporated LED “movers” with slash gobos and Charlie Bars [long flags] to break up the light in a similar basket-weave pattern. Because of this very open basket-weave construction and the fact that the load had a lot of shafts of light, I added in random slashes of hard light into the practical set and it mixed really well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volume could incorporate virtual lighting, too, via the “Brain Bar,” a NASA Mission Control-like section of the soundstage where as many as a dozen artists from ILM, Unreal and Profile sat at workstations and made the technology of the Volume function. Their work was able to incorporate on-the-fly color-correction adjustments and virtual-lighting tools, among other tweaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Madden, president of Profile and a member of the Brain Bar team, worked closely with Fraser, Idoine and gaffer Jeff Webster to incorporate virtual-lighting tools via an iPad that communicated back to the Bar. He could create shapes of light on the wall of any size, color and intensity. If the cinematographer wanted a large, soft source off-camera, Madden was able to create a “light card” of white just outside the frustum. The entire wall outside the camera’s angle of view could be a large light source of any intensity or color that the LEDs could reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;tier tier-basic container&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;tier centered-block&quot; readability=&quot;130.45202614379&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, a LED wall was made up of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roevisual.com/products/black-pearl.html&quot;&gt;Roe Black Pearl BP2&lt;/a&gt; screens with a max brightness of 1800 nits. 10.674 nits are equal to 1 foot candle of light. At peak brightness, the wall could create an intensity of about 168 foot candles. That’s the equivalent of an f/8 3/4 at 800 ISO (24fps 180-degree shutter). While the Volume was never shot at peak full white, any lighting “cards” that were added were capable of outputting this brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idoine discovered that a great additional source for Mando was a long, narrow band of white near the top of the LED wall. “This wraparound source created a great backlight look on Mando’s helmet,” Idoine says. Alternatively, he and Fraser could request a tall, narrow band of light on the wall that would reflect on Mando’s full suit, similar to the way a commercial photographer might light a wine bottle or a car — using specular reflections to define shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, virtual black flags — meaning areas where the LED wall were set to black — could be added wherever needed, and at whatever size. The transparency of the black could also be adjusted to any percentage to create virtual nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-assets.theasc.com/Mandolorian-HUC-FF-000176_A.jpg?mtime=20200205214848&quot; width=&quot;3415&quot;/&gt;Kuiil on his Blerg.
&lt;p&gt;The virtual LED environments were hugely successful, but traditional greenscreen still played a significant role in the production of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, and it was always on hand — especially for situations where the frustum was too wide for the system to adequately respond. The Volume was also capable of producing virtual greenscreen on the LED wall, which could be any size, and any hue or saturation of green. Among the benefits of virtual green-screen were that it required no time to set up or rig, and its size could be set to precisely outline the subject to be replaced — which greatly minimized and sometimes even eliminated green spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits to the virtual greenscreen. It is nearly immediate, requiring no rigging, stands, time to set up or additional lighting. It can be any size, meaning the green is really only the perfect size to outline the subject to be replaced. When this happens there is no (or extremely limited) green spill on the actors or reflected in other objects around the set. This all but eliminates the requirement for de-spilling green in post; a timely and tedious process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual greenscreens can, of course, only be on the LED wall. If lower portions of an actor’s body or set piece needs to be composited, then physical green screen is required as the floor is not an LED screen and a virtual green cannot extend past the LED wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When green is employed, live compositing is possible for the camera operator’s on-board monitor and the director’s monitor so that they can see the elements that will be composited into the shot and compose the framing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; workflow was somewhat inverted, because — unlike on typical productions — virtual backgrounds and CG elements had to be finished before principal photography commenced. Once the cinematographer approved the locations and lighting in the virtual art-department, the images were delivered to ILM for their work, which took about six weeks to complete for each load. At the time of photography, some manipulation and alteration of the virtual elements could take place, but many decisions about coverage, blocking and lighting were already locked in. Naturally, this required a degree of collaboration among the director, cinematographer, production designer and visual-effects supervisor that was closer than that on a typical production. But, as Fraser notes, it also meant that the cinematographer was hands-on throughout the creation of all the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In today’s production workflow, the cinematographer comes in to prep the film and then shoots and then is sent away until the grading process — so much work with the image happens in post that we’re not a part of,” asserts Fraser. “This inverted production workflow of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; keeps the cinematographer in the loop from the development of the image to the final image, which is often captured in-camera. Baz and I are there to shepherd the image through the whole process and this is so supremely important. Cinematographers work to design imagery every day, 12 hours a day, and we know how to look at an image and know immediately if its right or wrong. Visual effects artists have amazing skills, but they don’t always have the photographic experience to know what is right or wrong and a lot of times what we plan and photograph doesn’t get translated through post. With this kind of workflow we supervise every element of the shot and have a much closer partnership with visual effects to make sure that it works with what we and the director planned and executed on set. We get that final shot in camera and the result is pretty amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I personally enjoy that pipeline,” Favreau attests. “I have tried to learn as much as I could from the way animation approaches the pre-production and production schedule. I think the earlier in the process you can solve story issues, the more efficient the production process becomes. Animation has traditionally front-loaded the story process, whereas live-action allows you to kick the can down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to select the perfect lighting conditions would seem to allow a cinematographer the ability to create the perfect look for every shot. How wonderful would it be to have magic hour all day long; or even all week long for that matter?! Yet Fraser is keenly aware of making things too perfect and introducing an unnecessary artifice to the overall visual style of the show. “I won’t always want it to be a perfect backlight, because that ends up looking fake,” Fraser attests. “It’s not real. In the real world, we have to shoot at different times and we have to compromise a little, so if I build in a little bit of ‘roughness,’ it will feel more real and less fake. The idea is to introduce a little ‘analog’ to make the digital look better, to make it feel more real and make the effect even more seamless as if it were all real locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s where the system is very good,” Fraser continues. “It allows you to see what you're photographing in real-time. There are times in the real world where you don’t have a choice and you have to shoot something front-lit, but you still work to make it look pleasing. You shoot an exterior for four hours and the sun moves constantly and you get locked into those couple shots that aren’t perfectly backlit — but that’s reality. When you have the ability to make it perfect for every shot, that doesn’t feel right, so we had to really think about building in some analog. Jon was really keenly aware of this, as well. He had just finished doing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ascmag.com/articles/making-the-lion-king&quot;&gt;The Lion King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with Caleb [Deschanel, ASC] and they had scenes that they would stage in direct hard noon sunlight to give the film a more realistic feeling instead of just doing everything perfectly at golden hour — that just feels false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all felt a little like film students at the start of this,” Fraser says. “It’s all new, and we were discovering the limitations and abilities of the system as we went along. We continually pushed the system to break it and see where the edges of the envelope were — but the technology continued to evolve and allow us to push that envelope further. We’d say, ‘Oh, man, I wish we could …’ and someone at the Brain Bar would say, ‘Yeah, I think we can!’ And the next day we’d have that ability. It was pretty amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;5/ Fair enough. But, if you're a family that needs to buy a minivan, while it's nice that the 2018 Grand Caravan ($26,300 in 2018) has many features the 1996 Grand Caravan ($17,900 in 1996) did not, you still face the problem that you need an extra $8,500 to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DigitalOcean raises $100M in debt as it scales toward revenue of $300M</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, a cloud infrastructure provider targeting smaller business and younger companies, announced today that it has secured $100 million in new debt from a group of investors, bringing its 2016-era debt raise to a total of around $300 million. The company’s nearly $200 million debt raise in 2016 was preceded by an $83 million Series B in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch spoke with &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/digitalocean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;digitalocean&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean’s&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yancey-l-spruill&quot;&gt;Yancey Spruill&lt;/a&gt; (hired in 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/press/releases/digitalocean-appoints-new-ceo-and-cfo/&quot;&gt;along with a new, IPO-experienced CFO&lt;/a&gt;; the company added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hostingjournalist.com/cloud-hosting/digitalocean-hires-carly-brantz-as-cmo/&quot;&gt;new CMO earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;) to get under the skin of the new funding, and better understand the company’s revenue scale, its financial health and its future IPO plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm intends to use the new funds to invest in partnerships, boost product investment and grow what its CEO called an “early-stage” inside sales capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/as-5-more-startups-join-the-100m-club-are-we-just-making-a-pre-ipo-list/&quot;&gt;regular $100 million ARR club series&lt;/a&gt;, consider this something of a sister post. We’ll induct DigitalOcean later on. Today, let’s focus on the company’s momentum, and its choice of selecting debt over equity-derived fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contextual growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean is a large private company in revenue terms, with the former startup reporting an annualized run rate of $200 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/13/1570659/0/en/DigitalOcean-Named-to-Forbes-2018-Cloud-100-List.html&quot;&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and $250 million toward the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/press/releases/digitalocean-named-to-forbes-2019-cloud-100-list/&quot;&gt;end of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. According to Spruill, all the company’s revenue is recurring, so we can treat those figures as effective annual recurring revenue (ARR) results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the financial realm, DigitalOcean told TechCrunch that it has a mid-20s percentage growth rate, and the company claims that its EBITDA (an adjusted profit metric) are in the low 20s. Citing a “strategy over the next several years to continue to focus very specifically on the SMB and developer communities,” Spruill told TechCrunch that DigitalOcean will scale to $1 billion in revenue in the next five years, and it will become free cash flow profitable (something the CEO also referred to, loosely, as profitability) in the next two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that and the company expects to reach a $300 million annualized run rate inside the first half of 2020. How has it done all of that without raising new capital since it put roughly $200 million in debt onto its book back in 2016? A good question. Let’s talk about DigitalOcean’s economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean has a pretty efficient go-to-market motion, which in human terms means that it can attract new customers at relatively low costs. It does this, per the CEO, by attracting millions of folks (around four million, he said) to its website each month. Those turn into tens of thousands of new customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because DigitalOcean is a self-serve SaaS business, folks can show up and get started without hand-holding from sales. Sales cycles are expensive and slow. But, while allowing small companies to sign up on their own sounds attractive, companies that often lean on this acquisition method struggle with churn. So, I asked Spruill about that, specifically digging into customer churn via graduation, the pace at which customers that joined DigitalOcean as small companies left it for other players like Azure and AWS as they themselves grew (quote slightly condensed for readability):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any self-serve, early-stage, or SMB-focused business, [the] first three to four months is critical for [customers]. But when you look at our customer base over time — we look at every cohort of the eight year history of our company — all of our cohorts have grown each year, and our churn, which is what [your graduation rate] question is, do customers leave our platform, is &lt;em&gt;de minimis&lt;/em&gt; after customers have been on our platform for a year or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it doesn’t appear that churn is a catastrophe at DigitalOcean, which gives it what I’d call pretty attractive economics: Customers come in at relatively low customer acquisition costs, and with churn slipping very low after an initial quarter or so, the company can extract gross margin from those customers for quite some time. What does it do with that cash? It reinvests it. Here’s how Spruill explained that process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high retention rates of the customers and the strong revenue growth enable cash flow to support the growth and investment of the business and paying and supporting the debt. And when you think about the dilution, when you think about a business at our size and scale — the roughly $400 million of capital raised is probably the right proxy, if you look at our peers and our size and stage of company development — most of them the vast majority of the capital is equity. In our case, only a quarter of the capital, a little over quarter the capital is equity. So we’re going to use the cash flow leverage of the business to drive enormous returns to the equity in terms of not taking on that significant dilution, and still being able to grow the business in a in a responsible and exciting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chorus sound effect you are hearing in the background are the company’s early-stage investors rejoicing at DigitalOcean not selling more shares to grow, concentrating the value-upside to existing shares. Shares that they own a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s sum quickly: DigitalOcean is working to carve out an SMB and developer-focused cloud infra niche, keeping its economics in a good place by using low-CAC, self-serve revenue generation. The margins from that are paying for the company’s development, and its overall economics are good enough to allow it to leverage debt to invest in itself instead of equity. Overall, not what I expected to hear this morning, but that’s the fun part of news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s in the future? Probably not an IPO any time soon. The company just raised more debt, money that it probably intends to use before debuting. The CEO told TechCrunch that “the IPO option for DigitalOcean is on the table,” going on to cite his company’s growth, growth rate, operating margins, “soon-to-be free cash flow margins” and scale as allowing the upstart “to have the conversation that this is a company that could go public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, adding DigitalOcean to the $100 million &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/arr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;arr&quot;&gt;ARR&lt;/a&gt; club, and then I fancy a few more revenue milestones until an eventual S-1.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-backs-oracle-in-google-fight-b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-backs-oracle-in-google-fight-b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is siding with Oracle in the database giant's dispute with Google before the Supreme Court — a move that comes as Oracle's founder hosts a high-dollar fundraiser for the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Billions of dollars — and, Google argues, the future of software innovation — are at stake as a long-running copyright dispute between the two giant companies heads to the Supreme Court next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; The solicitor general's office weighed in Wednesday with &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;a brief&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/133564/20200219163650124_18-956bsacUnitedStates.pdf&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/133564/20200219163650124_18-956bsacUnitedStates.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a brief&lt;/a&gt; in support of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The administration found Google's policy arguments are &quot;unpersuasive&quot; and argued software code is copyrightable. Google's &quot;verbatim copying of (Oracle's) original computer code into a competing commercial product was not fair use.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brief also rejected Google's arguments about interoperability, noting that Google &quot;designed its Android platform in a manner that made it incompatible&quot; with the Java platform.&lt;br/&gt;At an earlier stage in litigation, the Obama administration took a similar position, urging the Supreme Court not to accept Google's appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration brief came Wednesday just as Oracle founder Larry Ellison opened &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;a campaign fundraiser&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/12/trump-visit-larry-ellisons-rancho-mirage-estate-fundraising-event/4743576002/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/12/trump-visit-larry-ellisons-rancho-mirage-estate-fundraising-event/4743576002/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a campaign fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; for President Donald Trump at his southern California estate. Tickets ran as much as $250,000, according to an invitation &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;obtained by the Desert Sun&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/12/trump-visit-larry-ellisons-rancho-mirage-estate-fundraising-event/4743576002/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/12/trump-visit-larry-ellisons-rancho-mirage-estate-fundraising-event/4743576002/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obtained by the Desert Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;News of the fundraiser prompted typically politically reserved Oracle employees to &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;publicly call out&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/13/21136577/larry-ellison-fundraiser-donald-trump-oracle-employees&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/13/21136577/larry-ellison-fundraiser-donald-trump-oracle-employees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly call out&lt;/a&gt; Ellison, arguing the president does not reflect the company's values.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The News Media Alliance, the Motion Picture Association and the Internet Accountability Project — frequent Google foes — were among the organizations that also offered support for Oracle in Supreme Court briefs Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle argues Google illegally copied parts of its Java code for its Android software. Google claims the code was not copyrightable and was used fairly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&quot;If Google's allowed to get away with this, then anyone with the resources can get away with it,&quot; said Rachel Bovard, a senior adviser to IAP, which does not disclose its funding sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side:&lt;/strong&gt; Google previously secured &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;support from IBM, Microsof&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/google-oracle-supreme-court-ibm-microsoft-copyright-a9f5aaac-ccf5-4c40-a22d-09a30d0b9093.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/google-oracle-supreme-court-ibm-microsoft-copyright-a9f5aaac-ccf5-4c40-a22d-09a30d0b9093.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;support from IBM, Microsof&lt;/a&gt;t and smaller tech companies like Etsy and Reddit. The search giant argues an Oracle victory would upend the long-standing industry practice of re-using software interfaces that has led to the development of interoperable computer software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“A remarkable range of consumers, developers, computer scientists, and businesses agree that open software interfaces promote innovation and that no single company should be able to monopolize creativity by blocking software tools from working together,&quot; Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; SAS Institute, a software company, &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;argued&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/133502/20200219151815011_2020.02.19%20SAS%20Institute%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;b23f0583-2dad-457a-be78-69c2e2e993cd&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Trump administration backs Oracle in Google fight&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/133502/20200219151815011_2020.02.19%20SAS%20Institute%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; in support of Oracle and told the court limiting copyright protections would deter investment in creating software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A group of ex-NSA and Amazon engineers are building a ‘GitHub for data’</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/gretel-nsa-amazon-github-data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/gretel-nsa-amazon-github-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Six months ago or thereabouts, a group of engineers and developers with backgrounds from the National Security Agency, Google and Amazon Web Services had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is valuable for helping developers and engineers to build new features and better innovate. But that data is often highly sensitive and out of reach, kept under lock and key by red tape and compliance, which can take weeks to get approval. So, the engineers started Gretel, an early-stage startup that aims to help developers safely share and collaborate with sensitive data in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not as niche of a problem as you might think, said Alex Watson, one of the co-founders. Developers can face this problem at any company, he said. Often, developers don’t need full access to a bank of user data — they just need a portion or a sample to work with. In many cases, developers could suffice with data that looks like real user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It starts with making data safe to share,” Watson said. “There’s all these really cool use cases that people have been able to do with data.” He said companies like GitHub, a widely used source code sharing platform, helped to make source code accessible and collaboration easy. “But there’s no GitHub equivalent for data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how Watson and his co-founders, John Myers, Ali Golshan and Laszlo Bock came up with Gretel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re building right now software that enables developers to automatically check out an anonymized version of the data set,” said Watson. This so-called “synthetic data” is essentially artificial data that looks and works just like regular sensitive user data. Gretel uses machine learning to categorize the data — like names, addresses and other customer identifiers — and classify as many labels to the data as possible. Once that data is labeled, it can be applied access policies. Then, the platform applies differential privacy — a technique used to anonymize vast amounts of data — so that it’s no longer tied to customer information. “It’s an entirely fake data set that was generated by machine learning,” said Watson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pitch that’s already gathering attention. The startup has raised $3.5 million in seed funding to get the platform off the ground, led by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/greylock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;greylock&quot;&gt;Greylock Partners,&lt;/a&gt; and with participation from Moonshots Capital, Village Global and several angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Google, we had to build our own tools to enable our developers to safely access data, because the tools that we needed didn’t exist,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive, and now a partner at Greylock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gretel said it will charge customers based on consumption — a similar structure to how Amazon prices access to its cloud computing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now, it’s very heads-down and building,” said Watson. The startup plans to ramp up its engagement with the developer community in the coming weeks, with an eye on making Gretel available in the next six months, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Telecoms say they have a First Amendment right to sell private data</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdza5/big-telecom-say-it-has-first-amendment-right-to-sell-your-private-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdza5/big-telecom-say-it-has-first-amendment-right-to-sell-your-private-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After lobbying to kill consumer privacy rules at the federal level, big telecom is now taking aim at individual state efforts to protect your privacy online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last June, Maine passed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0275&amp;amp;item=1&amp;amp;snum=129&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; intended to protect broadband user privacy. The law demands ISPs clearly disclose what data is collected and who it’s sold to, requiring that users &lt;em&gt;opt in&lt;/em&gt; to the sale of sensitive location or financial data. The law also bans ISPs from charging you extra if you want your privacy protected, a practice AT&amp;amp;T engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160329/08514034038/att-tries-to-claim-that-charging-users-more-privacy-is-discount.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this week the broadband industry sued the state of Maine, claiming that the law violates the industry’s free speech rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://acaconnects.org/u-s-district-court-for-the-district-of-maine-complaint-for-declaratory-judgment-and-injunctive-relief-w-ctia-ncta-and-ustelecom-re-maines-l-d-946/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;industry’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Maine’s law “imposes unprecedented and unduly burdensome restrictions on ISPs' protected speech.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maine's decision to impose unique burdens on ISPs' speech—while ignoring the online and offline businesses that have and use the very same information and for the same and similar purposes as ISPs—represents discrimination between similarly situated speakers that is impermissible under the First Amendment,” the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But telecom experts say the industry’s grasping at straws as it attempts to dodge accountability for a decade &lt;a href=&quot;https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0307/DOC-338091A1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rife&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;telecom related privacy abuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big broadband is clearly trying untested First Amendment arguments in the hope that something sticks,” former FCC lawyer Gigi Sohn told Motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since when does giving consumers a right to control their personal information become an unconstitutional limitation on broadband companies' speech?” Sohn asked. “And since when are broadband companies a protected class deserving of special legal protection from so-called discrimination?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sohn noted that the lawsuit, first spotted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/isps-sue-maine-claim-web-privacy-law-violates-their-free-speech-rights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a much broader effort by the industry to eliminate all meaningful state and federal consumer protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a gambit that has been hugely successful so far. With the press and public justifiably focused on the numerous problems with “big tech” monopolies, big telecom is quietly getting a free pass to engage in all the same (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;or worse&lt;/a&gt;) behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, telecom lobbyists convinced the Trump FCC to not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvnx85/has-net-neutrality-been-repealed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kill net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;, but eliminate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw5d5g/net-neutrality-big-telecom-broadband-deregulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most of the FCC's telecom consumer protection authority&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the FCC’s apathy let ISPs engage in behavior like charging consumers &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/frontier-customer-bought-his-own-router-but-has-to-pay-10-rental-fee-anyway/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rental fees for modems they already own&lt;/a&gt;, or jacking up subscriber bills via a bevy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d34wak/comcasts-fees-jump-241-percent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bogus fees and surcharges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the telecom sector has fought tooth and nail against the passage of federal privacy rules of any kind, Sohn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, telecom lobbyists convinced the Senate to scuttle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/538kqn/heres-the-data-republicans-just-allowed-isps-to-sell-without-your-consent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FCC broadband-specific privacy rules&lt;/a&gt; before they could even take effect. Sohn, who helped craft those protections, say they would have gone a long way in preventing or reducing the abuse of wireless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user location&lt;/a&gt; and other consumer data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to federal apathy, states including Washington, California, and Maine passed their own privacy and net neutrality laws. And while the industry has complained repeatedly that this created a confusing “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2018/08/ftc-2018-0051-d-0026-152105.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;patchwork quilt&lt;/a&gt;” of state consumer protections, Sohn said it’s a problem the industry itself created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The so-called ‘problem’ of state broadband privacy laws like Maine’s is one of the ISPs own making,” Sohn said. “They asked Congress to repeal the FCC’s modest and popular 2016 broadband privacy rules, got their wish, and now are upset that states want to fill the gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telecom lobbyists even convinced the FCC to include a provision in its net neutrality repeal banning states from protecting consumers. But the courts recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kx5a9/courts-mostly-back-fcc-assault-on-net-neutrality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shot those efforts down&lt;/a&gt;, saying the FCC effort exceeded the agency’s authority. Sohn said with the FCC effectively giving up on consumer protection, it’s well within states’ rights to step in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blake Reid, Associate Clinical Professor at Colorado Law, told Motherboard the industry’s lawsuit is another example of the sector trying to have its cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is bad enough that ISPs lobbied to repeal the FCC’s robust broadband privacy rules; they now have the temerity to pretend that the near-total vacuum of privacy protections for ISP customers at the federal level constitutes some kind of ‘uniform’ federal approach to privacy with which Maine’s law could conflict,” Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With former Verizon lawyers now in charge of both the FCC (Ajit Pai) and DOJ (Bill Barr), the federal government has further aided the telecom sector by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-net-neutrality-lawsuit-against-state-california-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suing states like California&lt;/a&gt; for attempting to protect consumers on issues like net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It should be no surprise to ISPs that states like Maine have stepped in to fill the void, and ISPs can hardly claim that having to protect their customers’ privacy conflicts with their non-obligations to do essentially nothing at all under federal law,” Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short the telecom sector not only gets to enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb57gx/no-broadband-competition-100-mbps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;little to no competition in broadband&lt;/a&gt;, the industry has waged an all out war to effectively eliminate all state and federal oversight of one of the most broken and disliked industries in America. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Kasaya – A scripting language and runtime for browser automation</title>
<link>https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscolabs/kasaya/master/docs/images/Logo-Kasaya-v5-with-text.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscolabs/kasaya/master/docs/images/Logo-Kasaya-v5-with-text.png&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; scripting language and runtime for browser automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write test scripts using English-like statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NO coding required to implement those statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not dependent on HTML IDs or XPaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the &lt;strong&gt;same way you would instruct another human being&lt;/strong&gt; sitting in front of the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NOT like Cucumber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NOT like Selenium IDE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do your initial dev test in REPL mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the statements as a script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share with QA to expand the scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even share with the product manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What You See Is What You Write:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscolabs/kasaya/master/docs/images/cat-age.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syscolabs/kasaya/master/docs/images/cat-age.gif&quot; width=&quot;750px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java JDK (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Chrome version 66 or higher (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js version 12 or higher (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run on a terminal window (on Linux, you may need &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ npm install -g kasaya
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Installation might take a few minutes&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a bug? Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya/issues&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Kasaya is still early beta, but we want to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Interactive mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ kasaya                     # browser window will open
Kasāya&amp;gt; open &quot;google.com&quot;    # executed in browser as you type
Kasāya&amp;gt; type &quot;cat&quot;
Kasāya&amp;gt; press enter
Kasāya&amp;gt; read &quot;Lifespan: ${min} – ${max} years&quot; near &quot;Family&quot;
Kasāya&amp;gt; check if $max is &quot;20&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Script mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ vi cat.kasaya
~~~~
  start
    # verify that the maximum lifespan of a cat according to google is 20 years
    open &quot;google.com&quot;
    type &quot;cat&quot;
    press enter
    read &quot;Lifespan: ${min} – ${max} years&quot; near &quot;Family&quot;
    check if $max is &quot;20&quot;
 end
~~~
:wq
$ kasaya cat.kasaya
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODO: Improve this section&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasaya's grammar is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hliyan/jarvis&quot;&gt;JARVIS&lt;/a&gt;, which is a rudimentary natural lanugage tool based on pattern matching. Targeted for test automation, it currently lacks certain basic programming language features such as conditionals and loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phrases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasaya's statements are made up of &lt;em&gt;phrases&lt;/em&gt; rather than keywords and functions. Phrases can either be built in, or macro-based. Arguments can be placed anywhere within the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasaya supports the following block level structures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;in this context&lt;/code&gt; - declare constants and imports for the file context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;how to &amp;lt;macro phrase&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - declares a macro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;start &amp;lt;run block&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - statements within run blocks will be executed immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extract a value within a pattern into a variable: &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello ${name}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable access within a phrase: &lt;code&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya/blob/master/docs/command-summary.md&quot;&gt;More commands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get Visual Studio Code extension for Kasāya scripting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya-vsix&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where does the name &quot;Kasaya&quot; come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed that many a test tool is named after brewed drinks (&quot;Mocha&quot;, &quot;Chai&quot;, &quot;Espresso&quot;). &quot;Kasaya&quot; (pronounced Kuh-SAA-yuh) is also a brewed drink -- it is an Ayurvedic medicinal drink popular is Sri Lanka (better known in India as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashayam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashayam&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's different about Kasaya?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Kasaya is that, if we're able to verbally instruct a human being to run a UI test without referring to DOM elements, XPATHs or HTML IDs, it should be able to do the same with a machine. Unlike in some natural language test automation tools, you don't have to write any functions to help resolve statements to HTML IDs or XPATHs. Kasaya works out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it based on machine learning?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It's based on clever but simple heuristics that attempt to mimic how human beings look at a screen and identify visual elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who developed this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasaya was envisioned and developed entirely by the folks at Sysco LABS, Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the current status of Kasaya?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing (Jan 2020), Kasaya is in public beta, which means while all the basics work, there's a lot to be ironed out before we can get to version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, yes! For now, please be patient with us -- we don't yet have a dedicated developer who can work with the community. But we're trying to get there, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you find bugs, or have great ideas, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I found a bug.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Please report it on our issue tracker, with reproduction steps: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya/issues&quot;&gt;https://github.com/syscolabs/kasaya/issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>BlurHash: Algorithm to generate compact representation of an image placeholder</title>
<link>https://blurha.sh/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blurha.sh/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Why BlurHash?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why would you want this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your designer cry every time you load their beautifully designed screen, and it is full of empty boxes because all the images have not loaded yet? Does your database engineer cry when you want to solve this by trying to cram little thumbnail images into your data to show as placeholders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BlurHash to the rescue!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace boring grey boxes with beautiful blurhash states and the designers will be happy. Blurhash strings are short enough to be added as a field in a JSON object and to be stored in a database. The implementations are small and easy to port to new languages, and the end result is a smooth and interesting experience for your users.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Morgan Stanley to Buy E-Trade for $13B</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/dealbook/morgan-stanley-etrade.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/dealbook/morgan-stanley-etrade.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley is betting its future on Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Wall Street giant moved further from its investment banking origins on Thursday with an agreement &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200220005462/en/Morgan-Stanley-Acquire-E*TRADE-Creating-Leader-Major&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to buy the discount brokerage firm E-Trade&lt;/a&gt; for about $13 billion, the biggest takeover by a major American lender since the 2008 global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The addition of E-Trade would allow Morgan Stanley to tap into a new source of revenue: the smaller-volume trades of the country’s so-called mass affluent, people who are wealthy enough to have some savings but not rich enough to buy into hedge funds or seek out a money manager. If it goes through, the deal will put Morgan Stanley, which does not have retail bank branches to draw in new asset-management customers, on firmer footing with competitors like Bank of America and Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It would also give Morgan Stanley a big share of the market for online trading, an additional 5.2 million customer accounts and $360 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, said the merger would disrupt neither E-Trade clients nor Morgan Stanley customers, but ultimately result in more services for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The deal highlights the increasing convergence of Wall Street and Main Street: Elite bastions of corporate finance are seeking to cater to customers with smaller pocketbooks, and online brokerage firms that once hoped to overthrow traditional trading houses are instead suffering from a price war that has slashed their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It also reflects a continuing shift in strategy for Morgan Stanley, which long relied on fees from high-finance services like mergers, stock offerings and massive trading desks but has lately embraced steady fees over bigger paydays and bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under Mr. Gorman, who has led the bank for a decade, Morgan Stanley has de-emphasized the businesses of jet-setting investment bankers and aggressive Manhattan traders, preferring the predictable and less costly realm of wealth management. It’s a strategy playing out all along Wall Street: In the dozen years since the start of the financial crisis, major financial firms from Credit Suisse to Goldman Sachs have embraced what are considered lower-risk business lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This continues the decade-long transition of our firm to a more balance-sheet-light business mix, emphasizing more durable sources of revenue,” said Mr. Gorman, whose most transformative deal at Morgan Stanley before Thursday was its &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/morgan-stanley-smith-barney-is-valued-at-13-5-billion/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;acquisition of Smith Barney’s retail brokerage&lt;/a&gt; firm in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;E-Trade was an enticing target: It has struggled as brokerage firms slashed fees in a fight that peaked last fall when Charles Schwab eliminated fees for the trading of stocks and exchange-trade funds, and later agreed to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/business/dealbook/charles-schwab-td-ameritrade.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;buy TD Ameritrade&lt;/a&gt; for $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Michael McTamney, who researches banks for the ratings agency DBRS Morningstar, said the deal accelerated Morgan Stanley’s growth plans. The bank already had a strong high-net-worth client base, he said, and now “they’ll be able to bring in this next generation of wealth via the E-Trade platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If the deal goes through — it needs the approval of E-Trade shareholders and regulators — more than half of Morgan Stanley’s pretax profits will come from wealth and investment management, compared with 26 percent a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley’s $2.7 trillion in assets are largely tied to big companies and wealthy individuals. The E-Trade deal would expand its access to the comparatively well heeled, a group that encompasses more than 20 million households in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Morgan Stanley could face a challenge luring this sort of investor toward its higher-touch investment management services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many E-Trade customers manage their own investments because of their intense distaste for the old-fashioned brokerage business. Others are hobbyists, trading a chunk of their retirement portfolios or some mad money. Both types have benefited greatly from decades of price wars that have made it possible for customers to pay nothing to maintain a brokerage account. Morgan Stanley will raise those fees at its peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the addition of E-Trade offers another way to make money from those customers. Morgan Stanley could use the brokerage firm as the vehicle for delivering other products and services, such as shares of initial public offerings it has underwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Mr. Gorman’s words, the combination would unite Morgan Stanley’s “full-service, adviser-driven model” with E-Trade’s “direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley is betting that regulators in Washington will approve what is perhaps the most consequential acquisition by a so-called systemically important American bank — the too-big-to-fail variety of financial institution — since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under the Obama administration, officials at the Federal Reserve fretted about the nation’s biggest banks growing through mergers. Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed governor, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/tarullo20121010a.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a 2012 speech&lt;/a&gt; that the central bank should have a “strong, but not irrebuttable, presumption of denial” for takeovers by America’s banking titans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the Fed has become more industry friendly during the Trump administration, particularly with the addition of officials like Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles, a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/business/economy/bank-regulations-fed.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;former bank lawyer who is helping reassess the rules&lt;/a&gt; put in place after the financial crisis. The central bank &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://investors.suntrust.com/news/news-details/2019/BBT-and-SunTrust-receive-regulatory-approvals-for-merger-of-equals-to-form-Truist/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently approved&lt;/a&gt; the combination of BB&amp;amp;T and SunTrust, paving the way for the creation of the sixth-largest U.S. commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The acquisition could look attractive to regulators from a financial stability perspective: The deal would infuse the Wall Street bank with stable deposits and reliable revenue streams. But it will also make Morgan Stanley more of a behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley doubtless hopes an E-Trade deal goes more smoothly than a past effort to pull in retail clients. Its &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/06/business/morgan-stanley-and-dean-witter-agree-to-merge.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;merger with Dean Witter Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; two decades ago foundered amid a clash between Morgan Stanley’s Wall Street aristocrats and Dean Witter’s more down-market brokers. Since then, however, the bank has been steadily shifting toward asset management — one of a number of approaches major banks have been trying to court Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Morgan Stanley’s traditional rival, Goldman Sachs, created a retail-focused lending arm, Marcus, in 2016 and teamed up with Apple last year to offer a credit card. Last month, Goldman said it intended to expand its retail deposit base to $125 billion, and its consumer loan and card balance to $20 billion, over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investors seem to be more taken with Morgan Stanley’s continuing shift than with Goldman’s, at least based on the Wall Street scoreboard of stock prices. Shares in Morgan Stanley have climbed nearly 33 percent over the past 12 months, while those in Goldman have risen about 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Late last year, JPMorgan Chase — already known for its enormous banking operations in both the consumer and the institutional areas — established a new platform that is meant to combine financial advisory services within its bank branches with wealth-management and online brokerage offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And Bank of America, whose acquisition of Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis made it a heavyweight in the wealth-management business, has moved to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/merrill-makes-a-play-for-younger-less-affluent-clients-11554735720&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;court less-wealthy clients&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under the terms of the deal announced on Thursday, Morgan Stanley will buy E-Trade using its own stock. Its offer is worth about $58.74 a share as of Wednesday’s market close, a 30 percent premium on the value of the online brokerage’s shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;E-Trade’s chief executive, Michael Pizzi, would continue to run the business upon the deal’s closing, which is expected by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;Jeanna Smialek and Ron Lieber contributed reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How Saudi Arabia Infiltrated Twitter</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-saudi-arabia-infiltrated-twitter</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-saudi-arabia-infiltrated-twitter</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;69.036681715576&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ali Alzabarah was panicked.&lt;/b&gt; His heart raced as he drove home from Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters in the early evening on Dec. 2, 2015. He needed to leave the country — quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier that day, Twitter’s management accused the unassuming 32-year-old of accessing thousands of user profiles without authorization to pass their identifying information — including phone numbers and IP addresses — &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-saudi-arabia-by-digging-into-the-accounts-of-kingdom-critics/2019/11/06/2e9593da-00a0-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reportedly to Bader al-Asaker&lt;/a&gt;, the head of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s charity and private office. When the conversation concluded, management seized Alzabarah’s laptop, put him on administrative leave, and escorted him out of the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving home at San Bruno’s Acappella Apartments — a complex so close to San Francisco International Airport he could hear planes fly overhead — Alzabarah planned his escape. At 5:17 p.m. he called a handler, identified as Associate-1 in the FBI complaint, who arrived in a white SUV two hours later. Driving around Alzabarah’s neighborhood, the two men called “Foreign Official-l” — al-Asaker, according to the Washington Post — at 7:20 p.m., and again at 7:22 p.m. and 7:31 p.m. They then called Dr. Faisal Al Sudairi, the Saudi consul general in Los Angeles, at 8:30 p.m., 8:38 p.m., and 9:26 p.m. Shortly after midnight, the consul general called Alzabarah back and spoke with him for three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early the next morning, Alzabarah, his wife, and daughter boarded a plane for Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From May 2015 until he was exposed that December, Alzabarah spied for the Saudi Arabian government inside Twitter, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1215836/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a criminal complaint&lt;/a&gt; from the FBI alleges. (Unless explicitly attributed to other sources, the details and allegations that follow are taken from the FBI’s criminal complaint.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
      
        
        

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pl4 md-float-right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  
    &lt;p&gt;
      &quot;They’re out of the company. You can never talk about it.&quot;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      
        
        

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;62&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, a colleague on Twitter’s global media team, regularly accessed and delivered information that could’ve led Saudi intelligence to identify anonymous dissidents. While news of the allegations against them has been public since November 2019, the extent of their roles and abilities inside the company have never previously been reported. Alzabarah, Abouammo, and al-Asaker did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Azabarah fled, he and Abouammo, who remained in the US, are currently indicted in United States federal court on charges of acting as undeclared agents of the Saudi government. No matter the verdict, the case has exposed tech companies’ vulnerability to attempted foreign infiltration. One well-placed employee can potentially do extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The message MBS gets from the world, from powerful countries, from the international community, is that he will get away with whatever he did or will do,” Abdullah Alaoudh, a legal scholar at Georgetown University whose father is imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, told BuzzFeed News. “Because he has money, he can control the process of oil. Therefore, everybody will go back to business as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
      
        
        


  &lt;hr class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz__section-divider subbuzz__section-divider--thin&amp;#10;             xs-block xs-mb4 xs-col-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;86&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ali Alzabarah’s disappearance&lt;/b&gt; didn’t cause a stir inside Twitter. “One day the general counsel came to me and said there was this crazy thing that happened. They’re out of the company. You can never talk about it,” a former Twitter executive told BuzzFeed News. “Inside, it was a total nonthing. No one in the rank and file who had ever heard of it. It was a nonissue.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Twitter’s employees been looking, they would’ve seen little turbulence on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzabarah, a good-natured, diligent employee, joined Twitter in August 2013. He initially came to the US in 2005, on a scholarship from Saudia Arabia, where he is a citizen, and earned degrees in computer science at various US universities, according to the FBI complaint. At Twitter, Alzabarah was a site reliability engineer — or SRE — tasked with keeping the site up and given extensive access to do so. He joined the company at a momentous time, right as the service was growing rapidly outside the United States and emerging as a political force worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I worked with him quite a bit,” one former Twitter SRE said. “He was a nice guy. I got along with him. He was helpful. He helped solve problems like everybody else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there, Alzabarah met Abouammo, who joined the company in November 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo, a gregarious and charismatic operator, joined Twitter just days before the platform’s initial public offering. He landed on its global media team and was responsible for growing usage in the Middle East. Abouammo spent his days speaking and socializing with prominent figures in the Middle East — in news, government, sports, TV, and music — enticing them to post on the site more often, sources on the media team told BuzzFeed News. He was their Twitter concierge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in addition to his regular job, Abouammo allegedly had a second task — being a mole for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo’s seduction by the Saudi government began innocuously: with a verification request. In April 2014, according to the FBI complaint, a public relations firm representing the Saudi Embassy asked Abouammo to verify an account belonging to a Saudi news personality, whom the FBI complaint did not name. This request for a blue checkmark opened the door to a working relationship with the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All evil begins with a verification request,” one of Abouammo’s former colleagues at Twitter joked. After the initial exchange, a representative from a US Saudi Arabian business council in Virginia asked Abouammo to set up a tour at Twitter headquarters. The tour, supposedly for entrepreneurs, reportedly included Bader al-&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-saudi-arabia-by-digging-into-the-accounts-of-kingdom-critics/2019/11/06/2e9593da-00a0-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asaker&lt;/a&gt;, an official working for Crown Prince Mohammed, who was then in the middle of a fast ascent to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo and al-Asaker met in London a few months later, according to the complaint. At the meeting, al-Asaker gave Abouammo a Hublot Unico Big Bang King Gold ceramic watch. The watch was expensive. In January 2015, Abouammo tried to sell it on Craigslist, claiming it was worth $35,000, but that he’d take $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo was eager to please and had a taste for money, a counterpart at a rival company who knew him told BuzzFeed News. “I think it was an extremely cash-based relationship,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after returning to Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, Abouammo logged into the system he used to verify users, according to the complaint. That system, sources who’ve accessed it told BuzzFeed News, stores information including email addresses, telephone numbers, and last log-in time — sufficient personal data to track down a user in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessing two Saudi dissidents’ information — one a prominent critic with more than 1 million followers, the other an impersonator of a Saudi Royal family member — Abouammo &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/page/file/1232901/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;allegedly passed the information&lt;/a&gt; to al-Asaker. Twitter had long been a godsend to dissidents: Unlike Facebook, it had no policy requiring people to use their real names, allowing critics of repressive government to speak more freely. The allegations threw its value as a tool of anonymous dissent into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it built its global media team, Twitter didn’t prepare for possible scenarios in which employees with access to sensitive data &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; close relationships with foreign governments might use it to spy, according to former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people running onboarding didn’t do much training in terms of the specificities of the challenges that we would be facing,” an ex-Twitter employee who worked alongside Abouammo told BuzzFeed News. “Nobody told us that we would be approached, that we would be — I don’t know if ‘seduced’ is the right word — that we would be intimidated into giving any kind of Twitter information.” Twitter has not responded to questions regarding this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State agents pressuring Twitter employees to deliver private information wasn’t uncommon at the company, former employees tell BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former colleague of Abouammo said US, UK, and Israeli security agencies pressed employees of Twitter’s media team for private information, including the Pentagon and CIA. “I can tell you, I’ve said no a lot,” he said. A spokesperson for the Pentagon declined to comment; a CIA spokesperson did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two years, al-Asaker paid Abouammo — via wire transfers to various accounts and a close relative — more than $300,000, some of which he used for a down payment on a house in Seattle. To al-Asaker, Abouammo provided private information on at least two dissidents, which the FBI complaint refers to as User-1 and User-2. But he could only take the Saudis so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to extract data — lots of it — from a tech company, a site reliability engineer can be quite helpful. SREs keep websites and apps up and running, and by necessity, often have extraordinary access into their companies’ internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo could access a user record here and there, but nothing close to what an SRE could get. And so, in February 2015, a few months after accepting the watch, he &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/page/file/1232901/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made an introduction&lt;/a&gt;, putting his handlers in contact with Alzabarah, a Saudi citizen living in San Bruno and a Twitter SRE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Abouammo, Alzabarah blended into the background at Twitter. He was quiet and pleasant. Good at his job. Inconspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzabarah’s aspirations were simple: In an Apple Note typed on July 18, 2015, and recovered by the FBI in a search of his Apple account, he wrote that he wanted a high-level position in a “charitable organization run by Foreign Official-I,” according to the bureau complaint. He later became CEO of the Misk Initiatives Center, an arm of Mohammed bin Salman’s Misk Foundation, a nonprofit the crown prince founded in 2011, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/1310756/saudi-arabia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the secretary-general of which is al-Asaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to become a member in it by any means or take training classes in leadership and business administration,” he wrote. “I want a permanent position ... something that secures my future and my family's, strengthens my relationship with them, and [makes me] feel reassured.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      &quot;He goes back and forth between Turkey and Iraq.&quot;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2015, Alzabarah “began to access without authorization private data of Twitter users &lt;i&gt;en masse,&lt;/i&gt;” according to the FBI complaint. Within six months, Alzabarah had pulled data on more than 6,000 users. This group included 33 users whose private data the Saudis had asked the social media platform to share through emergency disclosure requests. Twitter, the FBI complaint says, did oblige in at least five instances. Not only did Alzabarah hand over IP addresses of an undisclosed number of these users, but he also took detailed notes, tracking the movements of users of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzabarah’s fellow SRE wasn’t surprised at the level of detail his colleague was allegedly able to access. “If you're a foreign government looking to spy on other people, perhaps your own citizens, having that gives you an unprecedented level of access to the data,” he told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He goes back and forth between Turkey and Iraq,” Alzabarah wrote in a note to himself in his email account about one user on June 6, 2015, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is in Turkey and has a friend, or something, and they use the same Michigan State University account,” he wrote about another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He signed up for the service but he does his own encryption. We tracked him and found that 12 days ago he signed in once without encryption from IP [redacted],” he wrote of a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even outside of Saudi Arabia, the dissidents weren’t necessarily safe. On Oct. 2, 2018, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/23/middleeast/saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-intl/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saudi agents with close ties to the crown prince&lt;/a&gt; murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the regime, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Riyadh government has denied Crown Prince Mohammed knew about the assassination, but United States officials have said it could not have been carried out without his approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Feb.17, 2016,&lt;/b&gt; Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident with a popular &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/fitnahshow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oamaz7?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter page&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/canadian-refugee-activist-family-arrested-saudi-arabia-feud-2018-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;applied for asylum&lt;/a&gt; in Canada in 2014 and received it, got an email. The message from Twitter’s security team informed him a “bug” had exposed his and a small number of other accounts’ personal information. “The email address and phone number linked to your account was viewed by another account,” it read. “We wanted to alert you as soon as possible.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdulaziz, a friend of Khashoggi’s, told BuzzFeed News this email was the closest Twitter came to telling him Alzabarah accessed his information. He is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-06/twitter-mckinsey-ripped-by-saudi-dissident-suing-over-spy-hacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;now suing the social media platform&lt;/a&gt; over what he claims is a lack of disclosure about the incident. Twitter denies the charges. Abdulaziz believes he subsequently identified himself in the FBI complaint. “Twitter User-9 is a well-known and influential critic of the government with asylum in Canada,” the FBI complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m user number nine,” Abdulaziz told BuzzFeed News. Twitter has not responded to questions regarding this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the alleged spying put Abdulaziz at risk, the deeper damage was done to those Twitter users in Saudi Arabia, he said. He believes some were arrested and tortured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News could not independently confirm Abdulaziz’s account, as the full list of user profiles that Alzabarah and Abouammo allegedly accessed has still not been made public. But Abdulaziz believes that speaking out against the Saudi Arabian government on the platform is now dangerous. “Ten years ago, we were using Twitter to expose our opinion on what's really going on there, and we felt safe,” he said. “It was a secure platform for us. It's not like that anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouammo left Twitter in 2015 for a job at Amazon in Seattle. It was there that FBI agents visited him on Oct. 20, 2018. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agent Letitia Wu of the FBI’s Palo Alto office arrived at his house with questions about his alleged actions. Asked about the watch, Abouammo called it &quot;plasticky,” &quot;junky,” and worth only $500. Asked about the Saudi money, he said he only received $100,000, while the FBI says he received much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
      
        
        

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pl4 md-float-right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  
    &lt;p&gt;
      &quot;Twitter was a secure platform for us. It's not like that anymore.&quot;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      
        
        

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;78&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;In a bungled attempt to show he was paid for work he did after he left Twitter, Abouammo falsified a document the day the FBI agents visited him, according to the complaint. With agent Wu waiting, he went into his bedroom and returned with an invoice between him and al-Asaker. It said he worked for al-Asaker in 2015 and 2016, but according to the FBI, which reviewed its metadata, the document had been created on Oct. 20, 2018, the day of the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the FBI arrested Abouammo for failing to register as a foreign agent, it added charges of falsifying an invoice in an attempt to obstruct a federal criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, after learning of Alzabarah and Abouammo’s actions, installed safeguards to prevent employees from misusing their access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are constantly working to ensure our processes, systems, and checks protect the people that use our services,” a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “This includes learning from incidents like this. For example, we have made changes to our backend systems, our employee training, and our security and infrastructure to guard against this type of situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Company data access is limited to those with a business justification for access and is constantly reviewed,” the spokesperson continued. “It's clear from incidents such as this that threats will evolve and change, but we will remain vigilant. Our proactive efforts — and the efforts of the entire industry — are never done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal court in San Francisco has its next hearing scheduled in the case today. When his trial starts, Abouammo’s defense may struggle to explain the fake invoice. And then there’s a Twitter direct message he allegedly sent al-Asaker. “Proactive and reactively,” he said, “we will delete evil my brother.” ●&lt;/p&gt;
