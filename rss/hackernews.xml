<title>Who still needs the office? U.S. companies start cutting space</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is downsizing its real estate footprint as companies allow more employees to work from home, a growing threat to the bottom line of owners of traditional office buildings and a sign that companies are looking for ways to cut costs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Reuters analysis of quarterly earnings calls over the past week revealed more than 25 large companies plan to reduce their office space in the year ahead, a move designed to reduce the second-largest expense after payrolls at corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy company Halliburton Co said it intends to close more than 100 facilities. Financial services company State Street Corp said it is going to nearly double the workers assigned to one office before adding additional space, based on the assumption that a significant portion of its workforce will continue to work from home even after a vaccine for COVID-19 emerges. Bedding company Sleep Number Corp plans to slow the growth of its total square footage as more consumers shop online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should expect and hold us to a much lower footprint really starting quite soon,” State Street Corp’s CEO, Ronald Philip O’Hanley, said on the company’s July 17 earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp, meanwhile, told analysts: “Whether through increased use of hoteling, work from home or modified scheduling, we are confident overall office square footage will continue to decline,” as some workers share desks or stop coming into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the plans to cut back on real estate are likely the first wave of cost-cutting measures to hit office workers as companies try to maintain margins going into what may be a long recession. So far, the majority of the 14.7 million U.S. jobs lost during the pandemic have been in hard-hit areas such as restaurants, travel and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductions in office spending could likely be followed by layoffs and investments in technology that should help improve productivity with a reduced workforce, said Bill McMahon, chief investment officer of active equity strategies at Charles Schwab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, we’re seeing businesses starting to rationalize their physical plants and at some point they will turn to labor too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley in June forecast that work-from-home policies will increase vacancy rates in office buildings. Vacancy rates in New York will reach 10%-12% in the next two to five years from 8.7% now, while San Francisco will reach 7-9% from 5.8%, it predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, concerns about declining office space use have not hurt commercial mortgaged-backed securities, with the iShares CMBS ETF up 4.4% for the year to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While companies tend to cut back on their real estate needs during typical recessions, the last four months of economic lockdown have shown that many workers can remain productive at home, said Danny Ismail, an analyst at independent research firm Green Street Advisors. As a result, the cutbacks that companies are making are more likely to be permanent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every company just went through a mass work-from-home experience and for the majority it was mostly positive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Street Advisors expects that office demand will be reduced by up to 15% as a result of work from home policies once the coronavirus pandemic is contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reduction in necessary space will most likely hurt real estate investment firms with large exposures in cities such as San Francisco and New York as workers are expected to be given more freedom by employers to live in lower-cost areas away from the coasts, Ismail said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even before COVID-19, you’d seen a migration from majority coastal cities along the Northeast and West Coast to Sun Belt markets,” he said, referring to the region stretching from Florida to Southern California, collectively known as the Sun Belt. “We think that will accelerate in the future as the cost of living, quality of life and ability to keep your job is much better in a post-COVID-19 world than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to say that office demand will be reduced by up to 15%, instead of that up to 15% of U.S. office workers will likely remain remote, paragraph 13.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>62% of Americans Say They Have Political Views They’re Afraid to Share</title>
<link>https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third (32%) of employed Americans say they personally are worried about missing out on career opportunities or losing their job if their political opinions became known. These results are particularly notable given that most personal campaign contributions to political candidates are public knowledge and can easily be found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just one side of the political spectrum: 31% of liberals, 30% of moderates and 34% of conservatives are worried their political views could get them fired or harm their career trajectory. This suggests that it’s not necessarily just one particular set of views that has moved outside of acceptable public discourse. Instead these results are more consistent with a “walking on eggshells” thesis that people increasingly fear a wide range of political views could offend others or could negatively impact themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concerns are also cross‐​partisan, although more Republicans are worried: 28% of Democrats, 31% of independents, and 38% of Republicans are worried about how their political opinions could impact their career trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans with diverse backgrounds share this concern that their employment could be adversely affected if their political views were discovered: 38% of Hispanic Americans, 22% of African Americans, 31% of White Americans, 35% of men, 27% of women, 36% of households earning less than $20,000 a year, and 33% of households earning more than $100,000 a year agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are more worried about losing their jobs or missing out on job opportunities because of political views. Those with the highest levels of education are most concerned. Almost half (44%) of Americans with post‐​graduate degrees say they are worried their careers could be harmed if others discovered their political opinions, compared to 34% of college graduates, 28% of those with some college experience, and 25% of high school graduates&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My thoughts in response to the lawsuit against the Internet Archive</title>
<link>http://blog.archive.org/2020/07/22/libraries-have-been-bringing-older-books-to-digital-learners-four-publishers-sue-to-stop-it/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.archive.org/2020/07/22/libraries-have-been-bringing-older-books-to-digital-learners-four-publishers-sue-to-stop-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to share my thoughts in response to the lawsuit against the Internet Archive filed on June 1 by the publishers Hachette, Harpercollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I founded the Internet Archive, a non-profit library, 24 years ago as we brought the world digital. As a library we collect and preserve books, music, video and webpages to make a great Internet library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had the honor to partner with over 1,000 different libraries, such as the Library of Congress and the Boston Public Library, to accomplish this by scanning books and collecting webpages and more. In short, the Internet Archive does what libraries have always done: we buy, collect, preserve, and share our common culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember March of this year—we went home on a Friday and were told our schools were not reopening on Monday. We got cries for help from teachers and librarians who needed to teach without physical access to the books they had purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 130 libraries endorsed lending books from our collections, and we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlleddigitallending.org/&quot;&gt;Controlled Digital Lending&lt;/a&gt; technology to do it in a controlled, respectful way.  We lent books that we own—at the Internet Archive and also the other endorsing libraries. These books were purchased and we knew they were not circulating physically. They were all locked up. In total, 650 million books were locked up just in public libraries alone.  Because of that, we felt we could, and should, and &lt;em&gt;needed to&lt;/em&gt; make the digitized versions of those books available to students in a controlled way to help during a global emergency. As the emergency receded, we knew libraries could return to loaning physical books and the books would be withdrawn from digital circulation. It was a lending system that we could scale up immediately and then shut back down again by June 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, on June 1st, we were sued by four publishers and they demanded we stop lending digitized books in general and then they also demanded we permanently destroy millions of digital books. Even though the temporary National Emergency Library was closed before June 30th, the planned end date, and we are back to traditional controlled digital lending, the publishers have not backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and libraries are now preparing for a “Digital Fall Semester” for students all over the world, and the publishers are still suing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember that what libraries do is &lt;em&gt;Buy, Preserve,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lend books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled Digital Lending is a respectful and balanced way to bring our print collections to digital learners. A physical book, once digital, is available to only one reader at a time. Going on for nine years and now practiced by hundreds of libraries, Controlled Digital Lending is a longstanding, widespread library practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is at stake with this suit may sound insignificant—that it is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; Controlled Digital Lending—but please remember– this is fundamental to what libraries do: buy, preserve, and lend.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this suit, the publishers are saying that in the digital world, we cannot buy books anymore, we can only license and on their terms; we can only preserve in ways for which they have granted explicit permission, and for only as long as they grant permission; and we cannot lend what we have paid for because we do not own it.  This is not a rule of law, this is the rule by license. This does not make sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say that libraries have the right to buy books, preserve them, and lend them even in the digital world. This is particularly important with the books that we own physically, because learners now need them digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lawsuit is already having a chilling impact on the Digital Fall Semester we’re about to embark on. The stakes are high for so many students who will be forced to learn at home via the Internet or not learn at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Librarians, publishers, authors—all of us—should be working together during this pandemic to help teachers, parents and especially the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call on the executives at Hachette, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House to come together &lt;em&gt;with us&lt;/em&gt; to help solve the pressing challenges to access to knowledge during this pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please drop this needless lawsuit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Brewster Kahle, &lt;em&gt;July 22, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;When Amazon.com Inc.’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd Corp., it gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years later, in April, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit launched an artificial-intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does, said DefinedCrowd founder and Chief Executive Daniela Braga.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook&amp;#039;s employees reckon with the social network they&amp;#039;ve built</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employee-leaks-show-they-feel-betrayed</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;  xs-mb4 xs-relative &quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;60.549208534067&quot;&gt;
  
  




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On July 1, Max Wang&lt;/b&gt;, a Boston-based software engineer who was leaving Facebook after more than seven years, shared a video on the company’s internal discussion board that was meant to serve as a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think Facebook is hurting people at scale,” he wrote in a note accompanying the video. “If you think so too, maybe give this a watch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employees on their way out of the “Mark Zuckerberg production” typically post photos of their company badges along with farewell notes thanking their colleagues. Wang opted for a clip of himself speaking directly to the camera. What followed was a 24-minute clear-eyed hammering of Facebook’s leadership and decision-making over the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video was a distillation of months of internal strife, protest, and departures that followed the company’s decision to leave untouched a post from President Donald Trump that seemingly called for violence against people protesting &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/minneapolis-police-officer-arrested-george-floyd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the police killing of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. And while Wang’s message wasn’t necessarily unique, his assessment of the company’s ongoing failure to protect its users — an evaluation informed by his lengthy tenure at the company — provided one of the most stunningly pointed rebukes of Facebook to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are failing,” he said, criticizing Facebook’s leaders for catering to political concerns at the expense of real-world harm. “And what's worse, we have enshrined that failure in our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Max Wang, an engineer who worked at Facebook for seven years, posted an internal video message on July 1 as he prepared to leave the company, arguing that &quot;we are failing&quot; and that &quot;we have enshrined that failure in our policies.&quot; BuzzFeed News obtained audio of that message, which has been edited to remove a portion in which Wang thanks former colleagues but is otherwise left intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While external criticisms of Facebook, which has roughly 3 billion users across its various social platforms, have persisted since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, they’ve rarely sparked wide-scale dissent inside the social media giant. As it weathered one scandal after another — &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-uncovers-more-election-meddling-with-possible&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russian election interference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/christopher-wylie-cambridge-analytica-scandal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-genocide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rohingya genocide&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar — over the past three and a half years, Facebook’s stock price rose and it continued to recruit and retain top talent. In spite of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/facebooks-tensions-zuckerberg-sandberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occasional internal dustup&lt;/a&gt;, employees generally felt the company was doing more good than harm. At the very least, they avoided publicly airing their grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This time, our response feels different,” wrote Facebook engineer Dan Abramov in a June 26 post on Workplace, the company’s internal communications platform. “I’ve taken some [paid time off] to refocus, but I can’t shake the feeling that the company leadership has betrayed the trust my colleagues and I have placed in them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messages like those from Wang and Abramov illustrate how Facebook’s handling of the president’s often divisive posts has caused a sea change in its ranks and led to a crisis of confidence in leadership, according to interviews with current and former employees and dozens of documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. The documents — which include company discussion threads, employee survey results, and recordings of Zuckerberg — reveal that the company was slow to take down ads with white nationalist and Nazi content reported by its own employees. They demonstrate how the company’s public declarations about supporting racial justice causes are at odds with policies forbidding Facebookers from using company resources to support political matters. They show Zuckerberg being publicly accused of misleading his employees. Above all, they portray a fracturing company culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrated and angry, employees are now challenging Zuckerberg and leadership at companywide meetings, staging virtual walkouts, and questioning if their work is making the world a better place. The turmoil has reached a point where Facebook's CEO recently threatened to fire employees who “bully” their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it heads into a US presidential election where its every move will be dissected and analyzed, the social network is facing unprecedented internal dissent as employees worry that the company is wittingly or unwittingly exerting political influence on content decisions related to Trump, and fear that Facebook is undermining democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yaël Eisenstat, Facebook's former election ads integrity lead, said the employees’ concerns reflect her experience at the company, which she believes is on a dangerous path heading into the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these steps are leading up to a situation where, come November, a portion of Facebook users will not trust the outcome of the election because they have been bombarded with messages on Facebook preparing them to not trust it,” she told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the company’s policy team in Washington, DC, led by Joel Kaplan, sought to unduly influence decisions made by her team, and the company’s recent failure to take appropriate action on posts from President Trump shows employees are right to be upset and concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These were very clear examples that didn't just upset me, they upset Facebook’s employees, they upset the entire civil rights community, they upset Facebook’s advertisers. If you still refuse to listen to all those voices, then you're proving that your decision-making is being guided by some other voice,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you work at Facebook or another technology company?

It will always be the case that groups of people, even employees, see these decisions as inconsistent; that’s the nature of applying policies broadly,” the spokesperson said. “That’s why we’ve implemented a rigorous process of both consulting with outside experts when adopting new policies as well as soliciting feedback from employees and why we’ve created an independent oversight board to appeal content policy decisions on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his note, Abramov, who’s worked at the social network for four years, compared Facebook to a nuclear power plant. Facebook, unlike traditional media sources, can generate “social energy” at a scale never seen before, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But even getting small details wrong can lead to disastrous consequences,” he wrote. “Social media has enough power to damage the fabric of our society. If you think that’s an overstatement, you aren’t paying attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I Know Doing Nothing Is Not Acceptable”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 28, as protests against police brutality raged in Minneapolis and around the country, President Donald Trump posted identical messages to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, which have a collective 114 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way,” the president wrote that night. “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a matter of hours, Twitter placed Trump’s post behind a warning label, noting it violated its rules around glorifying violence. Meanwhile, Facebook did nothing. It had decided that the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — which has &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/05/29/864818368/the-history-behind-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;historical ties to racially oppressive police violence&lt;/a&gt; — did not constitute a violation of its terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In explaining the decision the next day, Zuckerberg said that while he had a “visceral negative reaction” to the post, Facebook policies allowed for “discussion around the state use of force.” Moreover, he argued that, in spite of the phrase’s historical context, it was possible that it could have been interpreted to mean the president was simply warning that looting could lead to violence. (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-facebook-zuckerberg-phone-call-d8d1016e-4e17-4906-b4f4-dc3e5c00bca7.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Axios later reported&lt;/a&gt; that Zuckerberg had personally called Trump the day after the post.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees, already angered by the company’s failure to take action against &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/twiter-fact-checked-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a post from Trump earlier that May containing mail-in ballot misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, revolted. In a Workplace group called “Let’s Fix Facebook (the company),” which has about 10,000 members, an employee started a poll asking colleagues whether they agreed “with our leadership’s decisions this week regarding voting misinformation and posts that may be considered to be inciting violence.” About 1,000 respondents said the company had made the wrong decision on both posts, more than 20 times the number of responses for the third-highest answer, “I’m not sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable,” Jason Stirman, a Facebook design manager at Facebook, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stirman/status/1266876587472896000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that weekend, one of a lengthy stream of dissenting voices. “I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following Monday, hundreds of employees — most working remotely due to the company’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; policies — changed their Workplace avatars to a white and black fist and called out sick in a digital walkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Facebook grappled with yet another public relations crisis, employee morale plunged. Worker satisfaction metrics — measured by “MicroPulse” surveys that are taken by hundreds of employees every week — fell sharply after the ruling on Trump’s &quot;looting&quot; post, according to data obtained by BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 1, the day of the walkout, about 45% of employees said they agreed with the statement that Facebook was making the world better — down about 25 percentage points from the week before. That same day, Facebook’s internal surveys showed that around 44% of employees were confident in “Facebook leadership leading the company in the right direction” — a 30 percentage point drop from May 25. Responses to that question have stayed around that lower mark as of earlier this month, according to data seen by BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culturally, Facebook has become increasingly divided, with some company loyalists pushing the idea that a silent majority supported the call made on the Trump post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Blind, a forum app that requires work emails for people to anonymously discuss their employer, some unnamed employees demanded that those involved in the walkout be fired. One thread focused specifically on Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook, who had &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasontoff/status/1267318891203530752&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted following the Trump decision&lt;/a&gt; that he was “not proud of how we’re showing up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His major responsibility is to acquire top talent and motivate his team, and that’s impossible to do when you publicly share that you aren’t proud of where you work at,” wrote one Blind user on a thread titled “Fire Jason Toff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other anonymous Facebook employees vilified May Zhou, a software engineer who had asked at an all-hands meeting how many Black employees had been involved in the Trump &quot;looting&quot; post decision. They called her &quot;disrespectful&quot; and a “sjw” — pejorative shorthand for “social justice warrior.” (In response to Zhou’s question, Zuckerberg said only one Black employee in the company’s Austin office had been consulted and that Facebook’s political speech policies needed tweaking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toff declined to speak for this story. Zhou did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ongoing contention and erosion of Facebook’s culture has infuriated Zuckerberg. In a June 11 live Q&amp;amp;A with employees, he pointedly addressed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've been very worried about … the level of disrespect and, in some cases, of vitriol that a lot of people in our internal community are directing towards each other as part of these debates,” he said. “If you're bullying your fellow colleagues into taking a position on something, then we will &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-protests-firing/facebook-fires-employee-who-protested-inaction-on-trump-posts-idUSKBN23J35Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fire you&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Our Community Standards Are Fundamentally Broken”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News pointed to the company’s lack of consistency and poor communication around enforcement of its community standards as a key frustration. In late May, following a decision by Twitter to place a misleading post about mail-in ballots from Trump behind a warning label, Zuckerberg &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-twitter-fact-checking-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appeared on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; to chastise his competitor for trying to be an “arbiter of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think in general, private companies probably shouldn’t be — or especially these platform companies — shouldn’t be in the position of doing that,” he said in the interview. Trump had made the same false claim on Facebook, which took no action against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, when Trump made his “looting” statement and Twitter moderated it and Facebook did not, Zuckerberg — the “ultimate decision-maker” according to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahfrier/status/1273310424109203456&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook’s head of communications&lt;/a&gt; — defended his position. “Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,” &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/zuckerberg-trump-facebook-post-divisive-remain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he wrote in a post&lt;/a&gt; on May 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took just four days for Zuckerberg to change his mind. In comments at a companywide meeting on June 2 that were &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first reported by Recode,&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s founder said the company was considering adding labels to posts from world leaders that incite violence. He followed that up with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-will-review-posts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a Facebook post three days later,&lt;/a&gt; in which he declared “Black lives matter,” and made promises that the company would review policies on content discussing “excessive use of police or state force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What material effect does any of this have?” one employee later asked on Facebook’s Workplace, openly challenging their CEO. “Commitments to review offer nothing material. Has anything changed for you in a meaningful way? Are you at all willing to be wrong here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 26, nearly a month later, Zuckerberg posted &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112048980882521&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a clarification&lt;/a&gt; to his remarks, noting that any post that is determined to be inciting violence will be taken down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s June 18 decision to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/red-triangle-facebook-trump-ads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remove a Trump campaign&lt;/a&gt; ad that featured a triangle symbol used by Nazis to identify political prisoners didn’t make things any better. Speaking at an all-hands meeting hours after the ads were taken down, Zuckerberg said the action was an easy call and evidence of Facebook’s commitment to applying its policies equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This decision was not a particularly close call from my perspective,” he said. “Our position on all this stuff is we want to allow as wide open an aperture of free expression as possible … but if something is over the line, no matter who it is, we will take it down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, however, reveal Facebook's decision to remove the Trump ads was not as simple as Zuckerberg claimed. In fact, the company failed to act on them until after it faced outside pressure, and despite internal alerts from its own employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning before the ads were removed, a heated discussion took place among Facebook employees after at least nine different people said they had reported the content but were told it did not violate company policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I reported it and called it out as both possible hate speech and threat of violence. This is apparently not a violation of our CS because our CS are fundamentally broken,” Natalie Troxel, a user experience employee wrote on Workplace, referencing the company’s community standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaitlin Sullivan, whose LinkedIn profile says she leads “the Americas branch of Facebook’s content policy team,” replied, saying the ad was still being evaluated and that “the triangle without any more context doesn’t clearly violate the letter there.” It wasn’t “helpful” to describe the company’s process as broken, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

A world leader is promoting content on our platform that uses explicit Nazi imagery,” Troxel responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that this has even remained on our platform for this long is troubling,” another employee added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel and Sullivan did not respond to requests for comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Facebook employee who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously for fear of retaliation said they were “flabbergasted” the ads weren't immediately ruled violative. “There’s a real culture within Facebook to assume good intent,” this person said. “To me, this was a case where you cannot assume good intent for a symbol that &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be Nazi imagery.” They also were bothered that Facebook took action on the ad only after receiving questions from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/18/trump-campaign-runs-ads-with-marking-once-used-by-nazis-designate-political-prisoners/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; — more than 12 hours after it had been flagged by employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It certainly looks like a decision would not have been made the way it was had there not been media pressure and a larger than normal involvement of Facebook employees on those posts and threads on Workplace,” the anonymous employee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident was yet another example of Facebook declining to act on violative content only to change its mind following public criticism. And once again, it raised questions about how decisions are made, and whether policies are applied consistently or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in reaction to negative publicity or political concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisenstat, the former Facebook election ads integrity lead, said the company’s failure to act quickly on the Trump ads, and to moderate his “looting” post, are further evidence that political considerations and outside pressure are influencing policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They put political considerations over enforcing their policies to the letter of the law,” she said. “I can say for my time there that more than once the [Washington] policy team weighed in on appeals and decisions that made it clear there was a political consideration factoring into how we were enforcing our policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related scenario played out earlier this month over &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-white-nationalist-ad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an ad run by a white nationalist Facebook page, “White Wellbeing Australia.”&lt;/a&gt; “White people make up just 8% of the world's population so if you flood all white majority countries with nonwhites you eliminate white children forever,” the ad proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook removed the ad and prevented the page from running paid content in the future only after being contacted by BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, July 8. But that move too came after a company employee flagged the ad and was told it wasn’t violative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I reported the page and the post and was told that it doesn’t meet the threshold for a content violation,” Facebook project manager Matthew Brennan wrote on Workplace after the publication of BuzzFeed News’ story. “There is no doubt this is a white supremacy group and the post in question is not trying to hide that fact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brennan, who saw the ad appear in his News Feed, said friends and family in Australia raised concerns about the ad over the weekend, leaving him frustrated that “there was nothing that could be done about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t exactly filling me with pride to work at Facebook,” Brennan concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I get the same from my wife, friends, and family,” another employee responded. “These decisions are going to be on the wrong side of history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brennan did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Facebook removed the ad and prevented the white nationalist page from running future ads. The page, however, continues to exist on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Diversity Is A Huge Problem”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his farewell video, Wang accused Zuckerberg of &quot;gaslighting&quot; employees and a “bait and switch” during an early June meeting in which the Facebook CEO explained the decision on the Trump “looting” post. Why was Zuckerberg only talking about whether Trump’s comments fit the company’s rules, and not about fixing policies that allowed for threats that could hurt people in the first place, he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Watching this just felt like someone was sort of slowly swapping out the rug from under my feet,” Wang said. “They were swapping concerns about morals or justice or norms with this concern about consistency and logic, as if it were obviously the case that ‘consistency’ is what mattered most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the departing engineer said echoed what &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ColorOfChange/status/1280907259250446337&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;civil rights groups&lt;/a&gt; such as Color of Change have been saying since at least 2015: Facebook is more concerned with appearing unbiased than making internal adjustments or correcting policies that permit or enable real-world harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a June 19 companywide meeting, for example, Zuckerberg turned a question about the decision-making influence of Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global policy and a former member of President George W. Bush’s administration, into a discussion about the need for ideological diversity. Kaplan, already a controversial figure within Facebook because of his &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/facebook-joel-kaplan-kavanaugh-hearing-mistake.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public support&lt;/a&gt; for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his heated 2018 confirmation hearings, has drawn ire from external and internal critics alike, who say that his moves to placate conservative Facebook power users like Trump are driven by politics and not any dedication to policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisenstat told BuzzFeed News that a member of Kaplan's Washington policy team had attempted to influence ad enforcement decisions being considered by her team, which she considered highly inappropriate. In one example, her team was evaluating whether to remove an ad placed by a conservative organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But then a policy person chimed in and gave the both-sides argument. They actually wrote something like, ‘There's bad behavior on both sides.’ And I remember thinking, &lt;i&gt;What does that have to do with anything&lt;/i&gt;?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you have the policy folks weighing in heavily on how you are enforcing that, to me, is where it makes it crystal clear this is not a strict letter-of-the-law enforcement. Because if it was, then policy should never intervene,” Eisenstat added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of answering the question about Kaplan’s influence at the meeting, Zuckerberg argued that his vice president brought an important conservative viewpoint to the table. “The population out there in the community we serve tends to be on average ideologically a little bit more conservative than our employee base,” Zuckerberg said. “Maybe ‘a little’ is an understatement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Zuckerberg, Kaplan’s Republican leanings contributed to “a good diversity of views” within the company. But for critics, the idea that moderating calls for violence or hate speech or Nazi imagery is little more than wrangling a political disagreement is disingenuous and prevents the company from taking a stand on civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He uses ‘diverse perspective’ as essentially a cover for right-wing thinking when the real problem is dangerous ideologies,” Brandi Collins-Dexter, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, told BuzzFeed News after reading excerpts of Zuckerberg’s comments. “If you are conflating conservatives with white nationalists, that seems like a far deeper problem because that’s what we’re talking about. We’re talking about hate groups and really specific dangerous ideologies and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Zuckerberg’s assertion that the team making key content and policy decisions is diverse was “a huge problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that he would look at the people around him on the board and in decision-making positions and pat himself on the back saying it has diversity is a huge problem right there,” Collins-Dexter added, referencing the company’s overwhelmingly white C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s recently completed &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Civil-Rights-Audit-Final-Report.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;civil rights audit&lt;/a&gt; reiterated concerns that the company’s leadership and decision-making process are falling short. “Many in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression,” the auditors wrote after their two-year assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      “If you are conflating conservatives with white nationalists, that seems like a far deeper problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of that report, Facebook has promised change. The company &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/facebook-will-evaluate-execs-on-diversity-inclusion-maxine-williams.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;added diversity and inclusion&lt;/a&gt; responsibilities to biannual performance reviews and elevated its chief diversity officer to report to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. In mid-June, Sandberg said the company would &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10163647016925177&amp;amp;%3Bset=a.404308695176&amp;amp;%3Btype=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commit $200 million&lt;/a&gt; to Black-owned businesses and organizations on top of a $10 million commitment to racial justice organizations made earlier that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even that decision was not easy, according to internal communications. Asked during a June 11 all-hands meeting if Facebook would introduce a donation-matching program presumably for Black justice organizations like many of the company’s Silicon Valley peers, Zuckerberg asked for employees to be realistic because they were in “the middle of a global recession.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our revenue is significantly less than we expected it to be,” he said, a week before Sandberg announced the $200 million commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees who have tried to use company resources on racial justice causes have also been frustrated. Every month, each of the company’s full-time employees gets $250 in ad credits to be used on the platform. Some employees, however, found that they were unable to use those ads to help boost civil rights groups that had drawn attention during the police brutality &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/2020protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; that swept the nation earlier this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internal document provided to BuzzFeed News noted that employee credits may not be used for ads “related to politics or issues of national importance.” For employees in the US, that means issues relating to “civil and social rights,” “environmental politics,” “guns,” “health,” and several other defined categories are off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s infuriating,” a current employee told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good Politics, Bad Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside calls for Facebook to change its policies — like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-ad-boycott-how-big-businesses-hit-pause-on-hate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Stop Hate For Profit ad boycott&lt;/a&gt; that now includes Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Verizon — have further ratcheted up internal tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two years ago, I wouldn’t have had conversations with my colleagues where I would be supporting the advertising boycott,” one employee told BuzzFeed News. “But we are having those conversations now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely unprecedented for Facebook, a company unaccustomed to widespread internal dissent. But Wang’s departure video, the virtual walkout, and the recent drop in employee satisfaction show Zuckerberg’s approach and fumbling explanations and reversals are beginning to take an internal toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think Facebook is getting trapped by our ideology of free expression, and the easy temptation of just trying to stay consistent with an ideology,” Wang said in his video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang’s departure thread kicked off a discussion, attracting comments from people like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/meet-the-man-who-makes-facebooks-machines-think&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yann LeCun, Facebook’s head of artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. After thanking Wang for his thoughts, the executive pointed employees to his own June 2 post in which he expressed concern that Facebook’s policy and content decisions are not geared toward protecting democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      “I would submit that a better underlying principle to content policy is the promotion and defense of liberal democracy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“American Democracy is threatened and closer to collapse than most people realize,” LeCun wrote on June 2. “I would submit that a better underlying principle to content policy is the promotion and defense of liberal democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeCun did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other employees, like Abramov, the engineer, have seized the moment to argue that Facebook has never been neutral, despite leadership’s repeated attempts to convince employees otherwise, and as such needed to make decisions to limit harm. Facebook has proactively taken down nudity, hate speech, and extremist content, while also encouraging people to participate in elections — an act that favors democracy, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As employees, we can’t entertain this illusion,” he said in his June 26 memo titled “Facebook Is Not Neutral.” “There is nothing neutral about connecting people together. It’s literally the opposite of the status quo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg seems to disagree. On June 5, he wrote that Facebook errs on the “side of free expression” and made a series of promises that his company would push for racial justice and fight for voter engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentiment, while encouraging, arrived unaccompanied by any concrete plans. On Facebook’s internal discussion board, the replies rolled in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is exactly one impressive thing about this post: by apparently committing to nothing at all but acting like you have, you’ve managed to placate some of us,” wrote one employee. “It’s good politics. It’s bad leadership.” ●&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The anti-privacy EARN IT Act could change the internet as we know it</title>
<link>https://mashable.com/article/earn-it-act-threatens-privacy-encryption-section-230/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mashable.com/article/earn-it-act-threatens-privacy-encryption-section-230/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Because the internet is a strange and complicated place, the fate of your digital privacy is, at this very moment, intertwined with that of online message boards and comment sections. And things, we're sorry to report, aren't looking so hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is the seemingly unrelated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EARN IT Act&lt;/a&gt;. Pushed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and a host of bipartisan co-sponsors, and voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, the measure ostensibly aims to combat online child sexual abuse material. However, according to privacy and security experts who spoke with Mashable, the bill both directly threatens end-to-end encryption and promises to spur new and sustained online censorship by weakening &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/section-230/&quot;&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt; — a provision of the Communication Decency Act of 1996 that protects internet providers from being held liable for their users' actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil, as it so often can be found, is in the details. That's because the newly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/download/grahams-amendment-to-s3398-managers_-oll20670&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amended version&lt;/a&gt; of the bill essentially gives state lawmakers the ability to regulate the internet, according to Joe Mullin, a policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who broke down the censorship risks posed by the measure should it become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All 50 states will be able to write new Internet rules that online platforms and websites will have to follow,&quot; Mullin explained in an email. &quot;The only limit on the new rules is that they will have to relate, in some way, to the fight against child sexual abuse. If websites don't follow the new state-level internet rules, they'll be exposed to private lawsuits and potentially state-level criminal prosecutions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concern is echoed by the ACLU which, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-opposition-earn-it-act-managers-amendment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;July 1 open letter&lt;/a&gt;, warned that &quot;[by] allowing states to set their own standards for platform liability for [child sexual abuse material], the amended version [of the EARN IT Act] allows states to create inappropriate standards by which platform responsibility for user-generated content should be judged.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case that's not clear enough, earlier this month, in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-letter-opposition-earn-it-markup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein and Sen. Graham, EFF director of federal affairs, India McKinney, predicted that the EARN IT Act would lead to the &quot;loss of Section 230 immunity&quot; for online platforms. In other words, online companies could be held liable for user-generated content. This could inspire those companies to proactively discontinue offerings — like message boards — that we all take for granted as an indelible part of internet culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why have a comments section, or a discussion forum, or an email service, or file storage services,  if you could get in big trouble for something that a user did — even without your knowledge,&quot; asked Mullin. &quot;Online platforms will hedge their risk by removing or not providing these features.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, even though the possibility of 50 distinct state-level rules exists if the EARN IT Act becomes law, it's not like living in one relatively hands-off state would necessarily exempt you. Why would a company go to the trouble of crafting 50 different policies and releasing 50 different location-specific offerings, after all, when it could simply tailor everything to the requirements of the most restrictive state government? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to encryption, or, more specifically, end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end encryption is the gold standard in digital privacy. When implemented properly, it ensures that only a message's sender and intended recipient can read its contents. Basically, it means that third parties like governments, private companies, and hackers aren't reading your messages, bank statements, and doctors' notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EARN IT Act, which technically is an acronym for the &quot;Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies,&quot; has a list of co-sponsors that include many Senators long in opposition to the idea of consumer access to end-to-end encryption. In 2016, Sen. Feinstein, one such EARN IT Act co-sponsor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/04/senates-draft-encryption-bill-privacy-nightmare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co-authored a bill&lt;/a&gt; with Republican Sen. Richard Burr that would have more or less made end-to-end encryption illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EARN IT Act may not be as explicit as previous efforts to ban end-to-end encryption, but experts insist it is likewise a threat to a technology used by companies such as Apple to protect customers' data from hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When initially introduced in the Senate on March 5 of this year, the EARN IT Act directly threatened the legality of end-to-end encryption — so much so, that back in April, Signal, a free and open-source, secure messaging app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/signal-messaging-app-anti-encryption-bill/&quot;&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; warning its ability to operate in the U.S. was at risk should the measure pass.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The EARN IT act turns Section 230 protection into a hypocritical bargaining chip,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/earn-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warned Signal&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;At a high level, what the bill proposes is a system where companies have to &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; Section 230 protection by following a set of designed-by-committee 'best practices' that are extraordinarily unlikely to allow end-to-end encryption.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill was amended last week to address some of those fears, but the changes weren't enough to convince actual privacy experts. Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society, made as much clear in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/07/earn-it-act-threatens-our-online-freedoms-new-amendments-don%E2%80%99t-fix-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a July 6 blog post&lt;/a&gt;. She wrote that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Leahy%20Amendment%20to%20S.%203398%20-%20OLL20683.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the amendment&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Patrick Leahy is &quot;not the silver bullet that some are holding it out as in terms of answering critics' concerns about how EARN IT could potentially discourage encryption and harm cybersecurity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullin agrees, and cautions that the bill could result in lawmakers insisting providers scan users' devices, messages, and conversations before they are ever encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;State lawmakers could easily get around the Leahy amendment by demanding some form of 'client side scanning,'&quot; he said, &quot;which has been the direction of the anti-encryption forces for about a year now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Wardle, principal security researcher at Jamf, founder of the free anti-malware service &lt;a href=&quot;https://objective-see.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Objective-See&lt;/a&gt;, and ex-NSA hacker, echoed Mullin in noting that the EARN IT Act looks to be more of the same from the anti-privacy crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[This] seems just to be the latest push by the govt. for weakening encryption,&quot; he said in a Twitter direct message. &quot;Hopefully it doesn't go anywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wardle's opposition to the EARN IT Act is notable for many reasons, and not just because he used to work for the NSA. In 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/07/24/mac-malware-fruitfly-beware/&quot;&gt;Wardle uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a malware strain that had infected hundreds of computers in the U.S. and was used to spy on unsuspecting victims through their webcams. In early 2018, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/10/fruitfly-malware-doj-arrest-phillip-durachinsky/&quot;&gt;Ohio man was charged&lt;/a&gt; with installing the malware on thousands of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Wardle — who literally helped bring to justice someone accused of an effort to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/north-royalton-man-charged-16-count-indictment-creating-and-installing-malware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;produce child pornography&lt;/a&gt;&quot; — opposes the EARN IT Act should be a huge tip-off that the measure isn't as straightforward as its proponents suggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/police-surveil-black-lives-matter-protesters-smart-streetlights/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police used ‘smart streetlights’ to surveil protesters, just as privacy groups warned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the bill hasn't passed yet; it hasn't even been brought to the floor of the Senate for a full vote. Not even the EFF could say when or even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the bill will get a full vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean the threat it poses to both your privacy, and the internet as we know it, is any less real should it eventually become law. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: TinyPilot – Build a KVM over IP using a Raspberry Pi</title>
<link>https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TinyPilot is my inexpensive, open-source device for controlling computers remotely. It works even before the operating system boots, so I use TinyPilot to install new OSes and debug boot failures on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/building-a-vm-homelab/&quot;&gt;bare metal homelab servers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post details my experience creating TinyPilot and shows how you can build your own for under $100 using a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/win-ubuntu.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 800px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/win-ubuntu_hue125486ed665e41847ca90a91bedb8e9_382227_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/win-ubuntu_hue125486ed665e41847ca90a91bedb8e9_382227_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/win-ubuntu_hue125486ed665e41847ca90a91bedb8e9_382227_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/win-ubuntu_hue125486ed665e41847ca90a91bedb8e9_382227_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/win-ubuntu.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/win-ubuntu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of TinyPilot connecting two computers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a grinch who wants to skip my fascinating tale of triumph and despair in developing TinyPilot, jump directly to the section, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/#how-to-build-your-own-tinypilot&quot;&gt;“How to Build Your Own TinyPilot.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I built my own home server for testing software. It’s been a valuable investment, and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/homelab-server.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 650px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/homelab-server_huf4489e09bc66769ad748ecb49d039df9_310452_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/homelab-server_huf4489e09bc66769ad748ecb49d039df9_310452_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/homelab-server_huf4489e09bc66769ad748ecb49d039df9_310452_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/homelab-server_huf4489e09bc66769ad748ecb49d039df9_310452_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/homelab-server.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/homelab-server.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of my homelab VM server&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homelab server I built in 2017 to host my virtual machines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server has no keyboard or monitor attached because I access it over ssh or a web interface. This is a convenient setup, but it also turns small issues into a colossal pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every few months, I’ll screw something up and prevent the server from booting or joining the network, effectively locking me out of the machine. To get things running again, I have to disconnect everything, drag the server over to my desk, and juggle cables around to connect the server to the keyboard and monitor at my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;commercial-solutions&quot;&gt;Commercial solutions &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/#commercial-solutions&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends have raved to me about their experience with iDRAC. It’s a chip in Dell servers that provides a virtual console from the moment the system powers on. I briefly considered an iDRAC for my next home server, but its hefty price tag quickly put an end to that. The license alone costs $300, and it requires expensive custom hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/idrac-price.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 700px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/idrac-price_hub0074bac6d11c9a6cbee65b24fd186bd_138079_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/idrac-price_hub0074bac6d11c9a6cbee65b24fd186bd_138079_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /tinypilot/idrac-price_hub0074bac6d11c9a6cbee65b24fd186bd_138079_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /tinypilot/idrac-price.png 1083w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/idrac-price.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of $300 price for iDRAC 9 Enterprise license&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A license for Dell’s iDRAC technology costs $300 per machine plus the cost of hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked at commercial KVM over IP solutions. They provide similar functionality to Dell’s iDRAC, but they’re external devices that connect to a computer’s keyboard, video, and mouse ports (hence the name KVM). Sadly, they’re even more expensive, ranging in price from $500 to $1000 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/raritan-kvm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 800px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/raritan-kvm_hu8001e8cf9999b2ec1a0c050db8c00444_159803_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/raritan-kvm_hu8001e8cf9999b2ec1a0c050db8c00444_159803_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /tinypilot/raritan-kvm_hu8001e8cf9999b2ec1a0c050db8c00444_159803_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /tinypilot/raritan-kvm.png 1157w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/raritan-kvm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of purchsase page for Raritan Dominion KVM over IP&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial KVM over IP devices cost between $500 and $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As lazy as I am about dragging servers around, I couldn’t justify spending $500 to save myself the trouble of swapping cables around a few times per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did what any appropriately irrational programmer would do: spend several hundred hours building my own KVM over IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-kvm-over-ip-with-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;Building a KVM over IP with Raspberry Pi &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/#building-a-kvm-over-ip-with-raspberry-pi&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; is a small, inexpensive single-board computer. The devices are powerful enough to run a full desktop operating system, so their $30-60 price point makes them a popular tool among hobbyists and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/pi-in-hand.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/pi-in-hand_hu0483a5ca04256b630e295ae7d06469c0_216502_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/pi-in-hand_hu0483a5ca04256b630e295ae7d06469c0_216502_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/pi-in-hand_hu0483a5ca04256b630e295ae7d06469c0_216502_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/pi-in-hand_hu0483a5ca04256b630e295ae7d06469c0_216502_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/pi-in-hand.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/pi-in-hand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi in the palm of my hand&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a fully-functional computer that fits on a single chip and costs only $30-60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent versions of the Pi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/usb/README.md#overview_pi4&quot;&gt;support USB on-the-go (USB OTG)&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the Pi to impersonate USB devices such as keyboards, thumb drives, and microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept of my Pi-as-KVM idea, I created a simple web app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi&quot;&gt;Key Mime Pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 700px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface_hue6937802635af04a8025c87b4bafac50_43995_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface_hue6937802635af04a8025c87b4bafac50_43995_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface_hue6937802635af04a8025c87b4bafac50_43995_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface.png 1182w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/key-mime-pi-interface.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Key Mime Pi web interface&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi&quot;&gt;Key Mime Pi&lt;/a&gt;, my early precursor to TinyPilot that only supported keyboard forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Mime Pi connects to another computer via USB and registers as a USB keyboard. It also presents a web page and listens for JavaScript key events. As the user types, Key Mime Pi captures the key events and translates them into keystrokes through its fake USB keyboard. This causes the keystrokes to appear on the target computer. I described this behavior in depth in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi#how-it-works&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-capturing-video&quot;&gt;The challenge of capturing video &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/#the-challenge-of-capturing-video&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard forwarding isn’t so useful if you can’t see what’s happening on the screen. My obvious next step was to find a way to capture my server’s display output in the Pi and render it in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at video capture was to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3cxrYfI&quot;&gt;Lenkeng LKV373A HDMI extender&lt;/a&gt;. Daniel Kučera (aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.danman.eu/&quot;&gt;danman&lt;/a&gt;) did an excellent job &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.danman.eu/new-version-of-lenkeng-hdmi-over-ip-extender-lkv373a/&quot;&gt;reverse engineering&lt;/a&gt; this device. It was available from Chinese merchants on eBay for around $40, so it seemed like my best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/lkv373a_hu7bdbd95c9cff56e72a06bde200ec990d_291108_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/lkv373a_hu7bdbd95c9cff56e72a06bde200ec990d_291108_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/lkv373a_hu7bdbd95c9cff56e72a06bde200ec990d_291108_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/lkv373a_hu7bdbd95c9cff56e72a06bde200ec990d_291108_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/lkv373a.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Lenkeng LKV373A HDMI extender&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3cxrYfI&quot;&gt;Lenkeng LKV373A HDMI extender&lt;/a&gt; was my first attempt at HDMI video capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing video was tricky because the LKV373A transmitter isn’t a video capture device. Its intended purpose is to pair with an LKV373A receiver that converts the network stream back to HDMI output. In danman’s investigation, he discovered a way to intercept and capture the video stream, but the LKV373A speaks a non-standard variant of the RTP protocol that few video tools understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, danman &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2017-May/211607.html&quot;&gt;contributed a patch to ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt; that handles the LKV377A’s goofy behavior, so I was able to render the stream using ffmpeg’s video player:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rendering the video stream from the LKV373A with ffplay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was here that I received my first taste of a problem that dogged me throughout the project: latency. There was almost a one-second delay between the target computer and the video playback on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a-latency.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/lkv373a-latency_huf5a4b8b025a27a03ab14dd8d1e51a39b_331792_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-latency_huf5a4b8b025a27a03ab14dd8d1e51a39b_331792_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-latency_huf5a4b8b025a27a03ab14dd8d1e51a39b_331792_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-latency_huf5a4b8b025a27a03ab14dd8d1e51a39b_331792_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-latency.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a-latency.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Lenkeng LKV373A HDMI extender&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LKV373A introduced 838 milliseconds of latency before any re-encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried playing around with ffplay’s many command-line flags to speed up the stream, but I never pushed past 800 milliseconds. And that was on my desktop with its high-end GPU and CPU. It didn’t bode well performance-wise for my scrappy little Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I found a better solution by complete coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mindlessly scrolling through Twitter, I happened to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ascii211/status/1268631069051453448&quot;&gt;a tweet by Arsenio Dev&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YHEvJN&quot;&gt;low-cost HDMI to USB dongle&lt;/a&gt; he had just purchased:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ascii211/status/1268631069051453448&quot;&gt;tweet from Arsenio Dev&lt;/a&gt; tipped me off to a better video capture solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing video at 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second seemed a little too good to be true, so I ordered one from eBay. It was only $11, including shipping. I don’t even know what you call it — it has no brand name, so I’ll just call it “the HDMI dongle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/hdmi-ebay.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 750px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/hdmi-ebay_huce81604e6792c704ab8bfc601ce05ff2_308459_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/hdmi-ebay_huce81604e6792c704ab8bfc601ce05ff2_308459_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /tinypilot/hdmi-ebay_huce81604e6792c704ab8bfc601ce05ff2_308459_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /tinypilot/hdmi-ebay_huce81604e6792c704ab8bfc601ce05ff2_308459_1200x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 1200w, /tinypilot/hdmi-ebay.png 1497w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/hdmi-ebay.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of HDMI for sale on eBay for $11.20&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HDMI to USB dongle available on eBay for $11.20 with free shipping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the device arrived a few days later, it blew me away. Without any tinkering, it showed up as a UVC video capture device as soon as I plugged it in to the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, I was able to capture and restream HDMI video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# On the Pi&lt;/span&gt;

ffplay.exe -i udp://@10.0.0.100:1234/stream
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so darn convenient, too. The LKV373A was nearly brick-sized and required its own power source and Ethernet cable. The HDMI dongle was as small as a thumb drive and required nothing more than a USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 700px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle_hu40e2cccf1bcf5bf83b5779b019db630b_378411_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle_hu40e2cccf1bcf5bf83b5779b019db630b_378411_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle_hu40e2cccf1bcf5bf83b5779b019db630b_378411_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle_hu40e2cccf1bcf5bf83b5779b019db630b_378411_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/lkv373a-vs-dongle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of Lenkeng LKV373A with HDMI dongle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3cxrYfI&quot;&gt;Lenkeng LKV373A HDMI extender&lt;/a&gt; (left) was larger and required more connections than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YHEvJN&quot;&gt;HDMI dongle&lt;/a&gt; (right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was, again, latency. The Pi’s rebroadcast of the video stream lagged the source computer by 7-10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 700px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg_hu2d9fdf379e1fcab8f739763e819f36ad_380166_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg_hu2d9fdf379e1fcab8f739763e819f36ad_380166_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg_hu2d9fdf379e1fcab8f739763e819f36ad_380166_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg_hu2d9fdf379e1fcab8f739763e819f36ad_380166_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/dongle-ffmpeg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of Lenkeng LKV373A with HDMI dongle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ffmpeg to stream video from my Pi, there was a delay in the video of up to 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure if this delay came from dongle itself, ffmpeg on the Pi, or ffplay on my desktop. Arsenio Dev reported latency of 20 ms, so it seemed like faster performance was possible if I delved into &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html&quot;&gt;ffmpeg’s arcane and mysterious command-line flags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stroke of luck spared me from that miserable task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi/&quot;&gt;my previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Key Mime Pi, I received a comment from Max Devaev, who encouraged me to check out his project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm&quot;&gt;Pi-KVM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Devaev pointed me to his existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm&quot;&gt;Pi-KVM&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous experience with breadboards involved &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/greenpithumb/#why-make-another-raspberry-pi-gardening-bot&quot;&gt;accidentally melting them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had looked at Pi-KVM briefly, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm#v2-diagram&quot;&gt;requirements of breadboards and soldering&lt;/a&gt; scared me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Max’s suggestion, I gave Pi-KVM a second look, particularly interested in how he solved the video latency issue. I noticed that he captured video through a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer&quot;&gt;uStreamer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: From further discussions with Max, I’ve learned that Pi-KVM does support builds without soldering or breadboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found a tool that’s so good, it solves problems you hadn’t even anticipated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right out of the box, uStreamer reduced my latency from 8 seconds to 500-600 milliseconds. But it also eliminated a whole chain of extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/ustreamer-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 700px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/ustreamer-1_hu286e60bb77a45e22c551ff98fbfa7c15_387842_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /tinypilot/ustreamer-1_hu286e60bb77a45e22c551ff98fbfa7c15_387842_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /tinypilot/ustreamer-1_hu286e60bb77a45e22c551ff98fbfa7c15_387842_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /tinypilot/ustreamer-1_hu286e60bb77a45e22c551ff98fbfa7c15_387842_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /tinypilot/ustreamer-1.jpg 1600w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/ustreamer-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;500 ms latency with uStreamer and the HDMI dongle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uStreamer reduced my latency by a factor of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to uStreamer, I wasn’t sure how to get video from ffmpeg into the user’s browser, but I knew it was possible somehow. I tested this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.peer5.com/guides/setting-up-hls-live-streaming-server-using-nginx/&quot;&gt;mostly-accurate tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for piping video from ffmpeg to nginx using HLS, but it added even more latency. And it still left open problems like how to start and stop streaming on HDMI cable connects and disconnects and how to translate the video to a browser-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uStreamer solved all of this. It ran its own minimal HTTP server that served video in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG&quot;&gt;Motion JPEG&lt;/a&gt;, a format browsers play natively. I didn’t have to bother with HLS streams or getting ffmpeg and nginx to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool was so fully-featured that I assumed Max simply forked it from a more mature project, but I was mistaken. This maniac &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer&quot;&gt;wrote his own video encoder&lt;/a&gt; in C just to squeeze the maximum performance out of Pi hardware. I quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/mdevaev&quot;&gt;donated to Max&lt;/a&gt; and invite anyone who uses his software to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uStreamer reduced my latency from 10 seconds down to ~600 milliseconds. That was a huge leap forward but still a noticeable delay. I told Max I was interested in funding uStreamer further if he could find ways to improve performance, so we got to chatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max was interested in the HDMI dongle I was using since he’d never seen that particular device. He invited me to create a shared shell session using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmate.io/&quot;&gt;tmate&lt;/a&gt; so that he could access my Pi remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/maxim-tmate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 680px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/maxim-tmate_huba1b6ea293c591400729591f9f171db9_61377_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/maxim-tmate_huba1b6ea293c591400729591f9f171db9_61377_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /tinypilot/maxim-tmate.png 680w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/maxim-tmate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of conversation where Max ofers to help me via tmate&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max offered to either help improve latency or frame me for a federal crime. Fortunately, he ended up doing the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of testing how uStreamer ran on my hardware, Max ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mankier.com/1/v4l2-ctl&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;v4l2-ctl&lt;/code&gt; utility&lt;/a&gt; and saw a line that fascinated him but totally went over my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ sudo v4l2-ctl --all

Streaming Parameters Video Capture:

        Frames per second: 30.000 (30/1)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HDMI dongle was delivering the video stream in Motion JPEG format! uStreamer’s hardware-assisted encoding was fast, but it was totally unnecessary, as modern browsers play Motion JPEG natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We configured uStreamer to skip re-encoding and just pass through the video stream as-is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping the extra re-encode step on the Pi reduced latency from 600 ms down to 200 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latency went from 600 milliseconds all the way down to 200 ms. It’s not instantaneous, but it’s low enough to forget the delay after using it for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember way back at the beginning of this post when I said I wanted TinyPilot so that I could access my headless VM server before it boots? Well, it works and I do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I iterated on Key Mime Pi to make a new web interface that integrates the video capture functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/tinypilot-bios.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built a new headless VM server this year and used TinyPilot to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proxmox.com/en/&quot;&gt;Proxmox&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source hypervisor and web interface for managing VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TinyPilot allowed me to manage the entire install from my browser. It was definitely more pleasant than my old process of dragging computers around and swapping cables back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi OS lite&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Raspbian) on a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/rufus-install.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 418px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /tinypilot/rufus-install_hu60172022de5ac1ffb7eb3c0c69f994fa_21143_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /tinypilot/rufus-install.png 418w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot/rufus-install.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Rufus&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://rufus.ie&quot;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; to write my Pi micro SD cards, but any whole disk imaging tool will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable SSH access by placing a file called &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; on the microSD’s boot partition. If you’re connecting over wireless, you also need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you finish preparing the microSD card, insert it into your Pi device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4 famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/best-way-keep-your-cool-running-raspberry-pi-4&quot;&gt;generates a lot of heat&lt;/a&gt;. You can run it fine without cooling, but you’ll likely hit stability issues over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3fG1fAa&quot;&gt;this minimalist case&lt;/a&gt; because it’s inexpensive and passively cools the Pi without the complexity of a powered fan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pi draws enough power from the target computer’s USB port to boot up and run, but it needs 3 Amps of power for stable operation. A computer’s USB port outputs &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi/#solving-the-power-problem&quot;&gt;less than 1 Amp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give the Pi enough power, use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YitxsN&quot;&gt;3 Amp USB wall charger&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2Yk1CIX&quot;&gt;USB to TTL serial cable&lt;/a&gt;. The USB to TTL cable plugs into the Pi’s outer row of GPIO pins just before the end of the row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to support further development of this software, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://paypal.me/mtlynchio&quot;&gt;donating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinypilotkvm.com&quot;&gt;purchasing a TinyPilot kit&lt;/a&gt;. Kits include all the equipment you need to build your own TinyPilot. It comes with a preformatted microSD card, so you don’t need to configure any software.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Why (on Earth) do you want to become a multi planetary species?? Have you ever tried to live in Antarctica or in the Atacama desert (I have)? I support science, exploration, tech development but not foolishness. Do you surround your house with roads to explore distant locations?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nubank acquires Cognitect</title>
<link>https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/07/23/Cognitect-Joins-Nubank</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/07/23/Cognitect-Joins-Nubank</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that Cognitect is joining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nubank.com.br/en/&quot;&gt;Nubank&lt;/a&gt; family of companies. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://building.nubank.com.br/welcoming-cognitect-nubank/&quot;&gt;next step in a long relationship&lt;/a&gt;, and opens new opportunities for &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datomic.com&quot;&gt;Datomic&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simplicity-at-scale&quot;&gt;Simplicity at Scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nubank is a spectacular success story for Clojure and Datomic, running mission-critical software at scale. From their start in 2013, Nubank has grown to 600 Clojure developers, running 2.5 million lines of Clojure code in 500 microservices on over 2000 Datomic servers. Cognitect has been there every step of the way, helping Nubank's developers translate Clojure's ideas into business agility. Nubank is the largest fintech in Latin America and has over 25 million customers using their online financial solutions. We support Nubank's mission of bringing banking to those who do not have it. And in the course of working together in Durham and in São Paulo, we have become friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bigger-hammock&quot;&gt;A Bigger Hammock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nubank is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cognitect.com/nubank-case-study.html&quot;&gt;vocal and public supporter of Clojure and Datomic&lt;/a&gt;, and is committed to their growth. Together, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;expand the teams behind Clojure and Datomic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer more &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/community/events&quot;&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;, more training, and more resources of every kind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work to improve &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/work/1732111/nubank-is-pushing-fintech-companies-to-prioritize-inclusivity/&quot;&gt;diversity&lt;/a&gt; at Nubank, at Cognitect and across the Clojure community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-value-of-values&quot;&gt;The Value of Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nubank understands the unique value of Clojure and Datomic, and is committed to continuing both without disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richhickey&quot;&gt;Rich&lt;/a&gt; will remain at the helm of Clojure, which remains independent, and will continue to manage Clojure's technical direction with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuarthalloway&quot;&gt;Stu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/puredanger&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich and Stu will continue as Datomic architect and product lead, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitect will continue to operate as a U.S. C Corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datomic development, product offerings, and customer relationships will continue and grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitect will continue to offer professional services for Datomic customers, but will transition out of general consulting development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-comes-next&quot;&gt;What Comes Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Clojure or Datomic user, the resources behind your software are greater than ever before. The next Datomic feature will come a bit sooner. We are dedicated to growing the Clojure community, and helping companies adopt and succeed with Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin, Rich, and Stu&lt;/p&gt;
