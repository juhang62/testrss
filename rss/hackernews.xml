<title>Ask HN: Advice for finding an entry-level remote job?</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26171008</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26171008</guid>
<description>Hi HN,
&lt;p&gt;I realize this isn't super on topic but I also feel like this is the best place I know of to ask for this advice, so here goes. I need some entry-level, remote-based work. What should I do? Help desk work seems the most promising / practical, but I haven't been able to find anything yet. The remote jobs I see posted are nearly all for higher-end positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in the poorest region of the United States, but I do the best with what I have. I’ve worked on my family’s farm and done a couple stints at retail beauty supply shops that friends own. I helped open two of those shops. That’s the extent of my non-existent resume. Given a chance to interview, I believe I would do ok. Maybe even exceed expectations for the sort of job I'm looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to work remotely for family reasons. I have a special-needs sister and I look after my youngest brother. They are what's most important to me, which is why I don't want to relocate. I have another brother who was helping me, but he accepted a job offer far away. Now I am the only relative near who'll be able to care and look over them. I have time for a full-time job, though, and I need a way to support us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a job offer that would require me to move by March 13th. The problem is that it is far from my family, and with my brother gone, I would be leaving them on their own. The job is at is an auto body repair shop paying minimum wage. I would be stressed every day worrying about my family back home. What I want is a way to work that lets me stay at home, fulfill my family responsibilities, and make money to keep things afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a techie at heart. I’m a Linux/MacOS person, but I easily adapt to other technologies. My first PC was a Compaq Presario that ran Windows 3.1. My father saw the ‘future’ in it, and he hoped I would be part of that future. To use it, you needed to enjoy torture to some extent. Still, it sucked me in. Something about that mysterious DOS prompt promised treasures if only I learned its magic. A few years later, I was dual-booting an ugly Dell machine (Windows 98 SE and Ubuntu). In between that time, my school still had an Apple IIe on which I loved playing Oregon Trail. I bought one a few years back for nostalgic reasons, but I had to leave it behind at my old residence. I miss it a lot. I hope it got a good home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently working through the freeCodeCamp course and intend to pick up Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke soon. I use VS Code and Spacemacs as my editors. I google like a madman. I have fun playing ukulele and guitar, and I’m teaching my youngest brother about the different parts of a Raspberry Pi. Oh, and I love to read. I am a habitual reader. There’s a lot more, but those are the kind of things that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn quickly, I am flexible, and due to working in customer service (beauty supply shops) I have a calm and understanding demeanor. I am a friendly person and I am always willing to find a solution, even when a solution seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be grateful for any advice, and I am particularly thankful for dang's / Daniel's time in editing this to be a better Ask HN submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can be contacted at AskHNremote2021@gmail.com and I can provide my GitHub as well, which is mostly documentation editing. I have been told I am a competent writer, if that counts for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I know that this is an unusual Ask HN post and I am grateful to anyone who takes the time to read through it. I'm curious how others in my situation managed to find remote work. I feel lost in all of this. To say that this has been a stressful time would be an understatement, but I'm turning to HN in the small chance the right person sees this and can give me suitable advice or point me in the right direction. I have always found comfort in this community, so this is where I've turned. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Changes to sharing and viewing news on Facebook in Australia</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content uk-width-4-5@m uk-width-1-1@s&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to Australia’s proposed new Media Bargaining law, Facebook will restrict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;publishers and people in Australia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This discussion has focused on US technology companies and how they benefit from news content on their services. We understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently. The answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news. Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, and as we have made clear to the Australian government for many months, the value exchange between Facebook and publishers runs in favor of the publishers — which is the reverse of what the legislation would require the arbitrator to assume. Last year Facebook generated approximately 5.1 billion free referrals to Australian publishers worth an estimated AU$407 million. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed. Journalism is important to a democratic society, which is why we build dedicated, free tools to support news organisations around the world in innovating their content for online audiences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last three years we’ve worked with the Australian Government to find a solution that recognizes the realities of how our services work. We’ve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adnews.com.au/news/facebook-s-will-easton-on-investing-in-australia-s-news-ecosystem&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;long worked toward rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that would encourage innovation and collaboration between digital platforms and news organisations. Unfortunately this legislation does not do that. Instead it seeks to penalise Facebook for content it didn’t take or ask for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were prepared to launch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/833782660493789&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place. This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;invest in new licensing news programs and experiences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others have also raised concern.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/webs-inventor-says-news-media-bargaining-code-could-break-the-internet-hes-right-but-theres-a-fix-153630&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Independent experts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and analysts around the world have consistently outlined problems with the proposed legislation. While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://australia.fb.com/post/our-response-to-australias-proposed-news-media-laws/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;fails to understand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;how our services work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Australian publishers this means:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For international publishers this means:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For our Australian community this means: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For our international community this means:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The changes affecting news content will not otherwise change Facebook’s products and services in Australia. We want to assure the millions of Australians using Facebook to connect with friends and family, grow their businesses and join Groups to help support their local communities, that these services will not change.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We recognise it’s important to connect people to authoritative information and we will continue to promote dedicated information hubs like the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/coronavirus_info/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;COVID-19 Information Centre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that connects Australians with relevant health information. Our commitment to remove harmful misinformation and provide access to credible and timely information will not change. We remain committed to our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;third-party fact-checking program with Agence France-Presse and Australian Associated Press and will continue to invest to support their important work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/01/26/facebook-news-will-help-sustain-quality-journalism/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;global commitment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to invest in quality news also has not changed. We recognise that news provides a vitally important role in society and democracy, which is why we recently&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/new-destination-for-news-in-the-uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;expanded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Facebook News t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;o hundreds of pu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;blications in the UK. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hope that in the future the Australian government will recognise the value we already provide and work with us to strengthen, rather than limit, our partnerships with publishers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>Changes to Sharing and Viewing News on Facebook in Australia - About Facebook</og:title>
<og:description>In response to Australia’s proposed new Media Bargaining law, we'll restrict publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing news on Facebook.</og:description>

<title>Visualization of 40M Cell Towers</title>
<link>https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencellid.org/&quot;&gt;OpenCelliD&lt;/a&gt; is the world's largest open database of cell towers with a license &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data has full world coverage and freely available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencellid.org/&quot;&gt;download.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tabular data[1] has ~40 million rows and 6 columns in it but only 3 columns (latitude, longitude, and type) are used in this visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[1] Structure of input data.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above table data is read line by line and grouped by their location info. Grouping is done as if they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/&quot;&gt;XYZ Tiles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, empty 2d integer arrays for each tile are created and its elements are initialized with value = 0. Those values hold a counter that shows the number of rows that geographically contained in that pixel. Every row increases the relevant counter by one[2]. After iterating all rows with this method, we end up with a bunch of integer values (in different 2d arrays) that represent row counts per region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[2] Each row increases relevant counter.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve city-level resolution for visualization, tiles up to zoom level 9 should be generated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/&quot;&gt;For XYZ tiles, the number of tiles per zoom level is 4^zoom.&lt;/a&gt; Therefore, for zoom levels between 0 to 9, the number of tiles that should be generated becomes 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + .. + 4^9 which equals to 349525. Every tile has 256x256 integer values. Even with using 32 bit-sized integer values, one tile occupies 256 * 256 * 32 bit = 256 kilobytes of storage, and &lt;strong&gt;349525 tiles&lt;/strong&gt; occupies &lt;strong&gt;87 gigabytes of storage&lt;/strong&gt; which is definitely not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this size problem every tile blob is compressed independently with a modern compression algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/brotli&quot;&gt;brotli&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being slow to encode, brotli has a fast decoding speed and high compression ratio compared to older compression methods like gzip. Additionally, brotli-compressed-data is &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#search=brotli&quot;&gt;natively decodable with all modern browsers&lt;/a&gt;. Since there are no cell towers in oceans or uninhabitable areas, tiles for those regions are full of zero values or very sparse. Due to this high redundancy, compression performed extremely well for those regions (256kb compressed to 20~100bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to simplify the algorithm, it is described as if there was only one counter value in each pixel, but there are 4 counter values per pixel each holding number of row counts for different cell tower types[3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;[3] Every pixel stores more than one channels (counter)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these tiles are stored like XYZ tiles, they are not valid XYZ tiles.Since these blobs are just brotli-compressed-integer-arrays. Visualization requires a blob to image conversion. This conversion is done by client side javascript and HTML5 Canvas API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying map displaying library in this visualization is &lt;a href=&quot;https://leafletjs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaflet&lt;/a&gt;. Kudos to leaflet author(s) for writing such a well documented and extendable map library, I was able to write a custom tile layer for leaflet that intercepts the image tile requests made by leaflet and redirects those image tile requests to an image generating (client-side) web worker that works like a tile server. Web worker follows a simple algorithm for image generation. It reads the row count values pixel by pixel and generates a color for that pixel (higher the row count lighter and more opaque the pixel color).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, this was a fun project for me to work on and I learned a lot about data compression and multi-threading while working on this. By off-loading compute-intensive tasks to web-workers, very impressive visualizations can be made even without sacrificing a single FPS drop on UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fighting orbital laser station “Polyus” / “Skif”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;(THE USSR)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vRb_iAi4sj8/V6igjYWZOKI/AAAAAAAABPo/6LaxidVk0dI_X7swTaVcqIBXuXhq_xqAACLcB/s1600/pole%2B16.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Space program of Star Wars, and the technology that you have not seen before.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vRb_iAi4sj8/V6igjYWZOKI/AAAAAAAABPo/6LaxidVk0dI_X7swTaVcqIBXuXhq_xqAACLcB/s1600/pole%2B16.gif&quot; title=&quot;Space program of Star Wars&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Specifications&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Length: 37.00 m (121.39 ft)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maximum Diameter: 4.10 m (13.5 ft)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mass: 80,000 kg (180,000 lb)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Associated Launch Vehicle: Energia.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Intended orbit: altitude 280 km (170 mi), inclination 64°&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Targeting system: optical, radar, with low-yield laser for final targeting&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Armament: 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ITAhROrlH5w/V6igsIb3bjI/AAAAAAAABPw/EEm94HDTt7sCoOJYU8ClpAGYHgefGZqsQCLcB/s1600/skif-11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ITAhROrlH5w/V6igsIb3bjI/AAAAAAAABPw/EEm94HDTt7sCoOJYU8ClpAGYHgefGZqsQCLcB/s640/skif-11.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Armament: 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to &lt;a title=&quot;Yuri Kornilov (page does not exist)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuri_Kornilov&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;Yuri Kornilov&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus’ launch, &lt;a title=&quot;Mikhail Gorbachev&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev&quot;&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country’s previous statements on the USSR’s peaceful intent.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-kornilov-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly. However, after disconnecting from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the rocket fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty&lt;a title=&quot;Inertial guidance system&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_guidance_system&quot;&gt;inertial guidance system&lt;/a&gt; that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-grondine-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;NPO Energia received orders from the &lt;a title=&quot;Government of the Soviet Union&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet government&lt;/a&gt; to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-70s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s, Energia had proposed two programs: laser-equipped Skif and guided missiles platform Kaskad (where Skif would cover the low-orbit targets, Kaskad engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO Astrofizika and KBSalyut, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the &lt;a title=&quot;Salyut program&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program&quot;&gt;Salyut&lt;/a&gt; DOS-17K frame.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called “pre-emptive retaliation” large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s1600/pole13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Skif spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the Beriev A-60 aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s640/pole13.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Skif a combat laser)&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The laser chosen for the Skif spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the &lt;a title=&quot;Beriev A-60&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriev_A-60&quot;&gt;Beriev A-60&lt;/a&gt; aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the Energia, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser “recoil-less”. The zero-torque exhaust system (SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite’s purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth’s &lt;a title=&quot;Ionosphere&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere&quot;&gt;ionosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new Energia launch vehicle, which was still in the &lt;a title=&quot;Testbed&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed&quot;&gt;testbed&lt;/a&gt; phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed Skif spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The launch May 15, 1987, shot by 24 cameras from different angles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The development of the real Skif was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the Energia launch vehicle, the launch pad and the Skif itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the Energia launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because “there will be heart attacks”.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif&quot; title=&quot;Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The catastrophic malfunction that led to Skif entering the atmosphere in the same area as Energia’s second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules’ covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn’t discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the Skif kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the &lt;a title=&quot;Ballistic trajectory&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trajectory&quot;&gt;ballistic trajectory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aerospace System “Spiral” – space application system consisting of the orbital plane, which is the start of the air technology was displayed in hypersonic space plane, overclockers, and then stage rocket into orbit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sdl49qj8rKg/V6inZw8e77I/AAAAAAAABQo/WSA3ZjZaT1w9wuc6Zq-uBKZAXLDqErORwCLcB/s1600/MiG-105-11a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aerospace System &amp;quot;Spiral&amp;quot; - space application system consisting of the orbital plane&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sdl49qj8rKg/V6inZw8e77I/AAAAAAAABQo/WSA3ZjZaT1w9wuc6Zq-uBKZAXLDqErORwCLcB/s640/MiG-105-11a.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Aerospace System &amp;quot;Spiral&amp;quot; - space application system consisting of the orbital plane&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Source of image WIKIPEDIA&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The “Spiral”, launched in 1960, was a response to the creation of the US space program interceptor reconnaissance-bomber, the X-20, “the Dyna Soar”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plane-overclockers&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Powerful airship overclockers (weight 52 tons, length 38 meters, wingspan of 16.5 m) was dispersed to six times the speed of sound (6M), then with his “back” at an altitude of 28-30 km was supposed to start a 10-ton manned orbital plane 8 m long and 7.4 m span.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSes4d9bcsg/V6inJIfNtfI/AAAAAAAABQg/lqy4GYfzDyk1Pp_vJyG_SIqnIVVrvhkzgCLcB/s1600/spiral1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Plane-overclockers&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSes4d9bcsg/V6inJIfNtfI/AAAAAAAABQg/lqy4GYfzDyk1Pp_vJyG_SIqnIVVrvhkzgCLcB/s640/spiral1.gif&quot; title=&quot;Plane-overclockers&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“The plane-overclockers to 6 Mach suggests the possibility of use as a passenger plane, airliner, which, of course, was rational: its high speed characteristics would allow to raise the rate of civil aviation.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plane-overclockers was the first technologically revolutionary detailed design of hypersonic aircraft with jet engines. At the 40th Congress of the International Aeronautical Federation (the FAI), which took place in 1989 in Malaga (Spain), representatives of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) gave the plane-overclockers high praise, noting that he “was designed in accordance with the modern requirements. “&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In view of the requirements of a lot of money for brand new motor, aerodynamic and material science technologies for the creation of such a hypersonic-overclockers aircraft in the latest versions of the project was considered less costly and more quickly achievable possibility of creating not a hypersonic and supersonic overclockers, as is considered modified shock-reconnaissance aircraft T-4 ( “100”), however it was not realized.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fortnite creator Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple to European Union antitrust regulators, escalating its dispute with the iPhone maker over its App Store payment system and control over app downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The two companies have been in a dispute since August, when the game maker tried to avoid Apple’s 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;That prompted Apple to kick Epic’s Fortnite game off the App Store and threaten to terminate an affiliated account that would have effectively blocked distribution of Unreal Engine, a software tool used by hundreds of app makers to create games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Epic Games founder and Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said Apple’s control of its platform had tilted the level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“The 30% they charge as their app tax, they can make it 50% or 90% or 100%. Under their theory of how these markets are structured, they have every right to do that,” he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“Epic is not asking any court or regulator to change this 30% to some other number, only to restore competition on IOS,” he said, referring to Apple’s mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The company also accused Apple of barring rivals from launching their own gaming subscription service on its platform by preventing them from bundling several games together, even though its own Apple Arcade service does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Apple said its rules applied equally to all developers and that Epic had violated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“In ways a judge has described as deceptive and clandestine, Epic enabled a feature in its app, which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines that apply equally to every developer and protect customers,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“Their reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;Headline-headline-2FXIq Headline-black-OogpV ArticleBody-heading-3h695&quot;&gt;EUROPEAN GATEKEEPERS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Epic Games’ EU complaint drew support from lawmaker Rasmus Andresen at the European Parliament, which will in coming months seek to reinforce EU tech rules proposed by the Commission to rein in U.S. tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“We as legislators need to ensure that these platforms who act as gatekeepers in the digital market have to respect a predefined set of rules in order to guarantee fair competition and balanced market powers,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Apple has in recent months made changes to its practices by lowering fees for some developers and giving them a way to challenge its rulings. Such measures have not satisfied the company’s critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Fortnite is expected to return to the iPhone at some point in the mobile Safari browser as part of Nvidia’s streaming game service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Epic first pursued legal action against Apple in the United States and the two parties have in recent weeks have been trading documents and conducting depositions ahead of a trial scheduled for May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The European Commission, which is investigating Apple’s mobile payment system Apple Pay and the App Store, confirmed receipt of the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“We will assess it based on our standard procedures,” a Commission spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Epic Games has also complained to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Australian watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Big companies such as Microsoft Corp, Spotify and Match Group Inc have also criticised Apple’s App Store fees and rules.&lt;/p&gt;
