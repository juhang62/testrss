<title>Stack Overflow Inc. Fiasco: Timeline</title>
<link>https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2019/10/05/stack-overflow-fiasco-timeline.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2019/10/05/stack-overflow-fiasco-timeline.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a timeline, to the best of my recollection, of the events that have been brought up as relevant to the current moderator-firing mess. (Current tally: 73 moderator positions currently vacant or suspended.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface: The Teachers' Lounge (TL) is a private room where the convention has been that people can let their hair down a little. Discussions of policies, how to handle specific moderation situations, and (often) outside politics and other hot topics are often vigorous. It's like when programmers discuss/argue about some technical design point extensively. Often it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; programmers discussing some technical policy point extensively In both cases, the goal is to refine the final product. Shog9, a senior community manager, described this dynamic in more detail somewhere that I can't find right now. It's also a place where people sometimes talk about deeply personal things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 2018: There was a TL discussion about gender-neutral pronouns and then &quot;preferred pronouns&quot;. (I know they're not &quot;preferred&quot;, but this was the phrasing used by the people bringing it up.) Some moderators who are not native English speakers expressed confusion. I said I avoid singular they for that reason, 95% of the time you can write around the problem, and (on SE) I'm offended when someone edits my posts &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; to solve a gender-neutrality problem. (Editing &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; is fine, which usually means pluralizing or using a name or something like that instead of either generic &quot;he&quot; or singular &quot;they&quot;.) Some people said not using preferred pronouns invalidates the person; I said for me it's not about the person at all but the quality of my own writing (an important part of my identity). Tension rose, other people said some things I saw as bullying, and I stepped out. For a long time after, I didn't enter the room unless strictly necessary. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; no employee said anything to me about my role in this conversation, and while some other mods disagreed with my position, none said anything like &quot;this is a Code of Conduct (CoC) violation&quot;. Employees witnessed this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of June 2018: I was the second-choice candidate for a community-manager position at Stack Overflow Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in summer 2018: another moderator made some very bigoted attacks against nonbinary and trans people. I can't remember if the comments specifically targeted one moderator who was out as NB or if they were more general. Either way, they were completely inappropriate. Some mods called for that mod to be fired, and a community manager said you don't get to do that. There were no public consequences for the rude moderator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days or maybe a few weeks later, the NB moderator resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 2019: a different moderator (henceforth OP) asked a question, tagged &quot;discussion&quot;, on the moderators' private Q&amp;amp;A site (&quot;team&quot;): should we require people to use people's preferred pronouns? (Again, the moderator, who is trans, used the term &quot;preferred&quot;.) OP self-answered to say, somewhat vehemently, that we absolutely must require this and using wrong pronouns is misgendering. I answered saying that we already have a negative commandment, don't call people what they don't want to be called (like wrong pronouns), which is proper, but this question calls for adding a positive requirement to use specific language and we shouldn't do that. I talked about writing in a gender-neutral way, that we rarely even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; third-person-singular pronouns in our discussions, and not using a pronoun &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; isn't misgendering. This was the top-voted answer, something like +53/-10 last I saw it. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Three different community managers posted answers after I did, and none said my answer was inappropriate in any way. (One disagreed with it, which is fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February: A community manager said, in an answer, &quot;we're working on this; send email if you have concerns&quot;. I sent email, got no answer, pinged, got no answer, I think pinged again with no answer, and set it aside. The question wasn't getting new activity at this point and fell out of my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late August or early September: That same community manager posted a team question asking what kinds of optional training moderators would like SE to provide, if there were to be some budget for such things, to help us do our jobs better. The question listed some things that were already in the works, including diversity &amp;amp; inclusion. I posted two well-received answers, one about data mining and one about intellectual property. OP posted an answer saying &quot;D&amp;amp;I training specifically about trans, and require mods to take it&quot;. The tone of the answer was pretty combative and people downvoted for that reason (as noted in comments). OP interpreted downvotes as transphobia. There was another answer that said something like &quot;cultural awareness / different cultures, as part of D&amp;amp;I&quot; that was presented positively and got a lot of support. (I know gender != culture; I'm pointing out that another D&amp;amp;I answer, presented constructively, was well-received.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-September: I went on vacation for a few days. This isn't directly related, but there should be one happy thing in this saga of woe. Also, it means I didn't look at the TL transcript for about four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 18: I got notifications of several voting events on that team post from January about pronouns. Usually a flurry of voting on a dormant post means it was linked somewhere, so I looked at the TL transcript, where I saw another mod refer to (and link to) my answer and call it &quot;bigoted&quot;. (I would be happy to have this answer, along with its question for context, made public to challenge this claim, but I don't think it's legal for me to release even an answer I wrote myself.) I responded to that message saying something like &quot;you falsely accuse me; please tell me what specifically you object to so I can clarify&quot;. The response persuaded me that the only problem was that this person disagreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same day: An employee with a &quot;director&quot; title posted and pinned a message saying the company is changing the CoC to require use of preferred pronouns and avoiding them is forbidden. I asked questions, most importantly: would it now be a violation of this new policy to write in the gender-neutral way that I already use? And how are you judging &quot;avoiding&quot;, which requires knowledge of intent? Other people had questions and issues too. One moderator pointed out a problem with something I was proposing to do and I agreed after it was explained and said I wouldn't do that. The employee did not stay to field questions, but came back a couple hours later to tell me &quot;we've been as clear as we can and your values are out of alignment&quot;. Confused, I left. &lt;strong&gt;This transcript was leaked on Reddit over Rosh Hashana.&lt;/strong&gt; It had been taken down by the time I got back online, but I was able to find a copy. On review, I don't see anything I said that would violate &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; the current or future CoC. &lt;strong&gt;No employee indicated to me any problems with my behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed out of TL from then on except to (1) flag something (two days later) and (2) respond to my firing (very briefly before being kicked). The discussion continued for the next two days, and on September 20 a community manager declared the topic closed, saying to send email if there's anything else you want to say. One queer moderator posted several messages objecting to this, and a CM (I can't remember if it was the same one) froze the room for the weekend. Two moderators who tried to post anyway were kicked out of chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't read much of the transcript for the next week and don't know what was said after the room was unfrozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 23: I received a reply from the CM I'd emailed back in February. It seemed to be an aggregate reply to that message and one I'd sent to the CM team on September 20 about the new policy. The email I received said some things that made me think my recent message had been misunderstood -- quite possible, as I'd written it quickly before Shabbat. I replied with questions and clarifications. The employee promised a reply &quot;tomorrow&quot;, then got sick and said it'd be another day, then was still sick, and finally promised a reply on September 27. (The employee was definitely back to work that day and handling other matters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 26: A queer moderator resigned in anger, with complaints about community managers, other moderators, and the &quot;entrenched power structure&quot;, and vague accusations of bigotry. The notice accused employees of dealing in bad faith with queer moderators and putting them in difficult situations. The notice said a single incident prompted the resignation but did not elaborate. When I read it I assumed that incident was the shutting down of the conversation the previous week, which the resigning mod had objected to at the time, but that has not been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9.732868757259&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 27: That email response never came. Instead, I was fired because they thought I wouldn't follow the future code of conduct. I've written &lt;a href=&quot;https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2019/10/03/stack-overflow-ignores-its-own-rules.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; about the many problems with how this went down. Moderators across the network began resigning or suspending their moderation activities. I sent (separate) email to the person who fired me, the CM I'd been having that email discussion with, and Joel Spolsky, chairman of the board and (then-)CEO. I received no replies. Sara Chipps, Director of Public Q&amp;amp;A, left responses on various moderators' resignation posts maligning my character. You can see an example on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5193/472&quot;&gt;Mi Yodeya post&lt;/a&gt;. The cut-and-pasted message included, specifically referring to me: &quot;When a moderator violates [inclusion and respect], we will always do our best to resolve it with them privately.&quot; Both halves of that statement are false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 30 (Rosh Hashana): When SE knew I would be offline and unable to respond, Sara Chipps made a statement to the press saying I'd been fired for CoC violations. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the first claim of a &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.5636363636364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 3: Sara Chipps posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/334248/162102&quot;&gt;non-apology &quot;apology&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in which she said I was fired &quot;for repeatedly violating our existing Code of Conduct and being unwilling to accept our CM’s repeated requests to change that behavior&quot;. Note the escalation here: she now says &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; CoC, &lt;em&gt;repeated&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;repeated requests&lt;/em&gt;. I said &quot;citation needed&quot;. This accusation was linked prominently on the front page of every site on the network. The next day, after a bunch of other answers had been posted that called her out on various issues, I added &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/334427/162102&quot;&gt;an answer of my own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where things stood right before Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Writing Is Thinking: Learning to Write with Confidence</title>
<link>https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you told me 5 years ago that I would one day lead a 20-person Publications team or have a personal blog that’s read by hundreds of thousands, I would’ve laughed in surprise. Yet somehow, I’ve found myself in that reality. &lt;em&gt;Here we are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask how I approach writing, so I decided to share this piece to sway the self-conscious writer inside each one of us. I hope it encourages others to develop a practice that enables them to write with confidence, by simply sharing how I’ve designed my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11.466666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &quot;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&quot; chances are you are.” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2O1NtNe&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;practice-makes-possible&quot;&gt;Practice Makes Possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, English was my least favourite subject &lt;strong&gt;by far&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, I grew up in Ontario, which mandated that only a single subject must be taken all the way through secondary school. And of course, it was English. I remember thinking﹣as any teenager would﹣that the world was a deeply unfair place. I would happily pile on some additional Calculus or Chemistry, but the thought of another year in English made me want to cry (and probably did at some point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/35qK4fDetnTz6vSj7dqOQeFmsQhsy17GC7Jzv2KnlSIy9iNWbvck1MyPrv7MFEb_5PJbN-Fx3jGWM4Y4FikVTNxoVslzWEF4SRwab-f_W5-evDALhBjTqgAybTa8ucEJPy-Ac4XQ&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;English was by far the subject that zapped most of my mental energy.
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that struggles with writing (or any creative pursuit, really) knows that when it doesn’t feel right, it’s not something that you can force. And if you do, you end up with a blank slate covered in word vomit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what most people don’t realize is that the resistance to writing is not unlike the resistance to other skills. And the antidote? Practice. Exposure. Iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice makes any seemingly impossible task &lt;em&gt;familiar&lt;/em&gt;. You can learn to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So since the days of braces and locker accessories, I’ve learned to write in a way that isn’t so scary. And the more I write, the more I feel the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html&quot;&gt;flywheel effect&lt;/a&gt; in action. I hope this article inspires the writer inside each person reading this, through the understanding that writing is a skill that can be acquired through continuous effort, easily accessed by creating a process with less friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-is-thinking&quot;&gt;Writing is Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to becoming “a writer” is acknowledging that no metric defines someone as “a writer”. And that anyone unabashedly claiming to be an expert, is likely far from it. You know what makes you a writer? Writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.364444444444&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ&quot;&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing, just like all else, is a muscle that can be flexed and built up into a habitual process that eventually flows. Because at its core, writing is simple: it’s a method of sharing your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people don’t realize is that it’s often not actually the writing that is difficult. It’s the &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; behind the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.&quot; - David McCullough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is essentially a robust tool that enables us to clarify and communicate our thoughts. While writing, you are forcing yourself to think critically and exercise parts of your brain that are typically on auto-pilot.  As Einstein once said, &lt;em&gt;“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”&lt;/em&gt; In attempting to formulate a written piece, you are going through the exercise of transforming vague ideas into clarified concepts externally, but also internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is often overlooked is that fact that having a clarified, unique, and thoughtful point of view greatly reduces the mental load required to write in the first place. So which is the chicken and which is the egg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5221238938053&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s through writing that we exercise our ability to think; they’re not mutually exclusive tasks. -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grammarly.com/blog/improving-your-writing-will-improve-your-thinking/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3MKVWAdc861cfRCMCL-RJTSSOsEOM1HBswnVwixczwmhe960zh4u8Rb0kISlqhHByThcO2R-Fs488ZDKcxbbhs3aiSmCmrqgdXX0uZpDZyd5HpTrfR0pFP9NVXjBDQe4Ehv_PDzz&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The Thinking and Writing cycle (TAW)
&lt;p&gt;Writing and thinking are two peas in a powerful pod. Critical thinking leads to good writing, which leads to clearer thinking, and so on. By improving your writing, you are also improving your ability to think and vice versa. So then the question then becomes, how does one activate this process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reducing-activation-energy&quot;&gt;Reducing Activation Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking &amp;lt;&amp;gt; writing (TAW) cycle described above is powerful, but also lofty. If I were to ask you to wake up tomorrow and have a finished article by EOD, I’m diminishing the mental load of you taking on two tasks: (1) the process of ideation and (2) the difficult task of abstracting these concepts into something that does your ideas justice. Almost certainly, one would be sacrificed across this short timeline. Most often, the focus on “producing an article” results in a majority of energy going into the output (2), without properly formulating the “why” behind an article (1), thereby making the writing process more painful overall. It’s the TAW cycle with a whole lot of friction, because you only have one turn around the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my solution is simple: I separate the two and exercise the cycle many times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely rare that I’ll come up with a concept and knock out the piece in one sitting. And I do this for a very specific reason: if I were to hold myself to that standard, I would never even make it to the drawing board. I’ve designed my writing process to embrace the practice of writing (and thinking), with a focus on reducing the activation energy to show up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-writing-process&quot;&gt;My Writing Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is by nature, a very personal and subjective process. So, if you take anything away from this article, it is not the specific steps that I’ve identified, but instead an ethos enabling you to craft your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I would ask yourself the question, “What environment can I create that will make it most likely for me to show up to this task?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that has come down to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decoupling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing for one variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoupling-the-writing-process&quot;&gt;Decoupling the Writing Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, I intentionally separate out my process into multiple steps: 6 to be exact (more on this below). I do this to utilize my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadershipforces.com/plan-using-energy-levels/&quot;&gt;energy levels&lt;/a&gt; optimally, across &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;passive&lt;/strong&gt; states. I don’t always have the mental energy to hard-core execute (active), so I allow myself to constantly and passively conceptualize, without too much pressure. The process is designed such that when I’m ready to enter an active state, like a focused writing session, I’ve already established a clear line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-process-steps-&quot;&gt;Writing Process Steps:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideation: &lt;strong&gt;Passive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking: &lt;strong&gt;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline - &lt;strong&gt;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idea Arbitrage - &lt;strong&gt;Passive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research - &lt;strong&gt;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing - &lt;strong&gt;Active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this ping-pong between passive and active states may seem chaotic to some, it is exactly what enables me to get things done without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a great tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draftback/nnajoiemfpldioamchanognpjmocgkbg&quot;&gt;Draftback&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially lets you “go back in time to look over your own shoulder as you write”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the tool to reflect on my process and understand how I iterate through an article. Naturally, I’ve also used it to consider how I might improve my process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this article (the one you’re reading), was created over a period of over a month where I would go back and forth between thinking and writing, until I finally had solidified what I was trying to say. It took over 19k revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mUP3UJCrvehszlNLwtM_mJ2ggTcCDMikhXI7ky81SFwb5jcoqAc5kPq216huyFGbbBK_gyaCbxKiFC23-QA0QxjiGAD0nIVtovskPVuF3eYqlud2MDpN8b3Hg7srlcpHsF2Q7KE6&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The evolution of this article.
&lt;p&gt;Another article that I wrote, literally took six months and many, many more writing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/x6hLYRUuDTF1_uDDKNGe6jNtN99pFl6clNM8DCut20CD3OupJK-do0FSSPDr4bQPy-PodW8Is6zwsd2VXiQMRjj1mxlJAVrzvwE_SISew-eg05NY-paWGg6n5cKNXFCIYhmxvWhS&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The evolution of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/effective-leadership/&quot;&gt;Effective Leadership&lt;/a&gt; article. 
&lt;p&gt;I’m not necessarily encouraging others to iterate this many times, and if anything I’m trying to scale back my edits, but it shows that the writing and thinking process takes time to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimizing-for-one-variable&quot;&gt;Optimizing for One Variable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to accept that you can’t have everything in life. That sentiment permeates into writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, writing should never be something that you do just to check something off of your to-do list. At its core, writing is a mechanism to try to deliver value to others. And over time, I’ve defined that as my core goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve this, I have to come to terms with trading off other variables like speed. As mentioned, many articles of my articles take weeks, while others sometimes take months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/10/image-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The number of days it has taken my to write articles on my personal blog. 
&lt;p&gt;This clearly isn’t always to my advantage, but it gives me something to orient around. If I tried to optimize completely across quality, speed, SEO-potential, among other variables, I would get paralyzed. So instead, I focus on one thing: quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a similar place of liberty to work on articles at your own pace, you may also consider making quality your north star. The point here isn’t that you need to choose the same north star, but to establish one that you form your process around. On that note, let’s jump into my writing process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-ideation-passive&quot;&gt;Step 1) Ideation: Passive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in my process is intentionally &lt;strong&gt;passive&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to get my TAW loop going, I set an open invitation to my brain to take note of anything interesting. More specifically, I look for anything within the intersection of: (1) interesting, (2) doesn’t exist online in that exact form, and (3) something I can contribute uniquely to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/69HNUU5KtotGTWL8-GC9YdLx729yqHaMmCqaUQnyed9mX6WAZgmILBLKVp-VPKSaBG0U0pWeOU8Jhf92cWJgG362MmKp7yCULHoNdJ27wJJXku3nLCKeAmTdm-3bJpwvr2eUslGO&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Idea Ikigai: the intersection of things that make a good article.
&lt;p&gt;With the barrier to entry to launching a blog or publish an article these days being so low, there is candidly a lot of crap out there. Before jotting down an idea, I ask myself, &lt;em&gt;“Does this exist on the internet today?”&lt;/em&gt; and if not, &lt;em&gt;“Should it?”&lt;/em&gt;. If I can answer those questions with confidence, I’ll consider pursuing the piece. For the same reason that I will never drop ship plastic goods that no one needs, I will never publish an article that I don’t truly believe can benefit others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about being considerate. It’s much harder to get attention on an article that is the same as thousands of others on the Internet. It’s also hard to write a good article about something you don’t care about (that’s why writing was such a draining task in school). So you can do yourself, along with the rest of the world, a favour by simply considering, &lt;em&gt;“What is something that I can uniquely contribute?”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I don’t need to tell the world that remote work is growing&lt;strong&gt;﹣&lt;/strong&gt;we have enough people doing that. But perhaps it would be helpful for me to talk about how someone with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/non-technical-remote-jobs/&quot;&gt;non-technical background might find a remote role&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been through multiple of these roles myself, hired a couple dozen non-technical remote teammates, and have spent years thinking about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that checks the right boxes will get the TAW cycle started, but I still won’t try to force it. In a few cases, I’ll sit down and write up a full draft. But for most, this step is simply adding the concept in a new Google doc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually goes into the document varies significantly. Sometimes, it’s as little as a single line or link. Below are two examples, where you can see that article concepts often start out super basic and often unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zu1n9QMpvN9CivNO_aHoWk_BvtZ2MMdn4YK6V0_VwptD4uZ0aMvDwclgQt-UxU5DKTNjsxal8nOKo3-fl_xduEU2JG9sLDxvb_1EYXOTvQCVQ5PYXNaMLMqaTrSj9tDbtkRzDmxP&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Basic outline for a future article about the mentality around &quot;winning&quot;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/U2a0v-o7rX9hJBfrQxsoSq4nGCUgtbTp2k1DQHhXLBwAAGsedflG_nJuPKFtbcvDO5eBps3ATczevSyeQq4NZziNNGohR2zwjiwyez0ftWbxxFkOcDREb5bz9iPIS-giM-tiks0d&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Basic outline for a future article about positivity being a choice.
&lt;p&gt;These ideas for these articles come from absolutely everywhere. Conversations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stephsmith.io/books&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and articles, personal experiences, and random &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1164942345902665729&quot;&gt;Google searches&lt;/a&gt; have all generated inspiration for pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when you’re younger and someone disagrees with you, so they ask you to rattle off examples supporting your argument? Put on the spot, you feel stuck and unable to think of any, despite knowing there are many. The same would be true if I asked you to come up with 10 great article topics on the spot. Allowing yourself to catch onto signals passively is the most sure route to accumulating a lovely cabinet of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the impetus behind some of my articles came from the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-tracking-active&quot;&gt;Step 2) Tracking: Active&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is tracking, which is basically just adding the idea to my ongoing spreadsheet. But more importantly, I’ll typically take the opportunity to quickly do some keyword research. This is for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to see if the article has the potential to rank. Even though SEO is a fancy word for a not-so-fancy industry, keyword research is essentially a mechanism to see if this is something people are actually looking for. If there is no search volume, yet I still think it can deliver value, I’ll write it anyway. But I want to be cognizant of this: Google processes billions of queries and if there is literally no search volume, I need to be able to justify why this might be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also do keyword research at this stage to spot secondary keywords that may influence the outline I create next. I make sure to do it at this stage, because I’m not a fan of keyword stuffing, but I do believe in Google is a big data mine to understand what people want to know. If I incorporate those signals into the outline, I’m not only more likely to bring in more traffic, but genuinely deliver a better article serving people’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could and probably will write an entire article (or 10) on how I approach SEO research, but for the purpose of this article, I’ll just share that I use these tools: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com&quot;&gt;Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/&quot;&gt;Keyword Planner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://keywordseverywhere.com/&quot;&gt;Keywords Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-937inVVaVP2HUq79c7yQHAEYqqKti_loIbGxZsz7NgFQvtgTEuDCpwfwxkIQHfPkBPKcNDk1PB50hibURbJ9c-VaWiBMfwig97ZH2SlkJCDY1nP2pQtJWqFSWreADCpm6yPvleY&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My ongoing document tracking current, future, and past articles.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-outline-active&quot;&gt;Step 3) Outline - Active&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’ll utilize the mix of my (rough) ideas and SEO research to create an outline. It’s always in bullet-point form and will have approximately 3-6 major headings, with sub-points underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to start the outline at this stage, as this will set the stage for the next step of passive “idea arbitrage”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sZqFK0Fsa7-XpnAljtDu7zY2DbfTJTn4DT1OkSYR5wGGhRlz9CAESVoqa1fxCHqLfZ6sUqKFmGtuxDzvNaZt7eRctoN3gJ94ysPzYPtaEZtOz580Tdlk7s3R7jUb9fhm6CQS8j3S&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;My original outline for my recent article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/untranslatable-words/&quot;&gt;Gaining Perspective Through Untranslatable Words&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-idea-arbitrage-passive&quot;&gt;Step 4) Idea Arbitrage - Passive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating an outline, I enter the fourth stage: Idea Arbitrage﹣my personal favourite. Despite the ridiculous name I’ve chosen for this stage, I ultimately feel as though this is the part of my process which makes my articles stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this stage, I simply let the article sit. I let the creative juices in my passive brain marinate and be stimulated by just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I run into an interesting tweet or quote or tidbit from an article, I’ll make sure to add it to the right outline. I do this for literally weeks or even months, until I feel like I’ve crafted a unique point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To augment this process, I love using two tools: &lt;a href=&quot;https://readwise.io&quot;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weavatools.com&quot;&gt;Weava highlighter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://readwise.io&quot;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; syncs all of my Kindle quotes (now over 1000 highlights across 20+ &lt;a href=&quot;https://stephsmith.io/books&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;). Prior to Readwise, I literally would take time and type these into a Google sheet. But now, it’s a seamless “Sync highlights” click and a delightful UI to sift through them. I’ll typically go through new quotes monthly and add them to the respective outlines that are in the passive idea arbitrage stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, when I am reading an online article and a particular quote sticks out to me, I’ll utilize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weavatools.com/&quot;&gt;Weava highlighter&lt;/a&gt; to store the thought and return to them periodically. In addition to augmenting my writing process, this practice helps with reading retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9a2uWiT9aR8F1i9qgWoACkNDiCtXoipOD7ah9V4dPkJUEeoz-QdFMVe-hxQHUKwQApwOsJRlpHtUsxhRSvXblvzGkZ4zWaLMa3-aM1zBDXyw-f3y4j5yZ6l-SLQCzHAZwARsebMx&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Example of the Weava interface.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important note: when I first started doing this, I would just blindly toss ideas into Evernote, but that required a whole lot of cleanup when I started writing the piece. With the new process of setting up the outline from the outset, I’m instead actively filing this information where needed. It’s my own personal Dewey Decimal system, so that when it comes down to writing a piece, I have a beautiful library to operate off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Yqtv2PRRAJrEj5KsK45F0Cfw2yJfXMDtBcShRssht-8eex2m-FZqJEgJMwsVuchLR4yjsEfQ2JUZXjpfTdcGcObOVz4AT7R6F7R4aarGUIxuhYtze3ejtLgzVNDQqd4Othkk50-V&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Visual of the idea arbitrage step.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-research-active&quot;&gt;Step 5) Research - Active&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, a piece needs more than a few tweets or quotes to truly have authority. So, I typically augment an article with at least a few hours of active research. This stage closely mimics the research that one would do to write a college essay, but this &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; happens once I’ve done quite a bit of passive ruminating, so that I have a clear POV of what I want to convey. I thoroughly enjoy this phase, as it allows me to “write to learn”; to build my articles off of not just my intuition, but the amazing work of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To write a great book, you must first become the book.”  -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-active&quot;&gt;Writing - Active&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s time for the hard part: writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll typically only sit down to really craft a piece once I have at least a few thousand words of what I’ve started to call “notes ‘n quotes”. The reason I do this is simple: I am not a natural writer. Putting words down on paper sometimes comes naturally to me, but often it does not. And that means that in order for me to consistently write, I need to make it as easy as possible for me to build the habit; I need to lower the activation energy to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5987654320988&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.” -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m sitting down to a blank slate of pixels, you better bet my brain sets off an alarm that “This will be hard and grueling and you can’t do this, Steph!”. But if instead, I’m sitting down to an outline that I’ve been passively ruminating on, that’s supported by concrete examples, it doesn’t seem so bad. I’m effectively approaching the writing phase, with maybe 7/10 of the work already completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had I decided to write an article from scratch in a day, not only would the end result be more shallow, it would freak me the f*** out. And quite frankly, I just wouldn’t do it. In effect, I’m trying to be patient with my own psyche and set up an environment that makes me most likely to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.4869109947644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2O1NtNe&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am struggling to put words on paper, I’ll ask myself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would I explain this to a friend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This helps me discern whether I’ve actually spent enough time thinking through the core concepts. Remember, writing is thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;What specifically are you getting hung up on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I find that sometimes I can get caught up in certain problematic routines. For example, if I created an outline with a ton of info, sometimes I struggle to strip some of it out. If I reflect and catch myself doing this, I will more readily cut things out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the only phase where I will set time limits. Not because I have deadlines, but because I’m trying to improve my “finishing muscle”. To this day, I still have over a dozen articles that I almost finished, but did not. And there’s a clear course across all of them. I got maybe 80-90% there, but since I didn’t finish them completely, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval/status/1158964119023652864&quot;&gt;Lindy effect&lt;/a&gt; only becomes more material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while not always possible, once I start the active writing process (Step 6), I try to close out the article in that particular session, get my little hit of dopamine, and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.9855072463768&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Resistance is most powerful at the finish line” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2O1NtNe&quot;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Personal Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that this is &lt;strong&gt;my personal style&lt;/strong&gt; of researching and writing, built upon the constraints (or lack thereof) within my life; most markedly that this is a personal blog. I don’t have deadlines or an editor to impress. Instead, my north star is delivering articles I’m proud of. In all honesty, this process almost certainly would not work in a paid writing environment solely due to turnaround expectations, but as an independent writer, I love the flexibility it gives me to create content that I'm happy to put my name on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that because I’ve been doing this for a while, I have over 50 pending articles at some stage in the process. I estimate that for every article I publish, a few new article ideas spring to mind, so I’m never really jaded or in search of something to write. I view this entire process as a way to formulate, process, and share my ideas, but I’ve found that a byproduct has been that it helps me think more clearly. As I go through the weeks or months of dwelling on the core takeaways of a given article, I learn to transform what are sometimes vague and lacking concepts into tactile, digestible pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I’ve started to use the very process for a book that I hope to write: Thinking in Curves. &lt;em&gt;It’s currently in the Idea Arbitrage state (and been there for months).&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-do-it&quot;&gt;Just Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hopes that you will go out there and write, I encourage you to focus on the process and not the outcome. Many of your articles, as many of mine are, will be flops. Even some of your best may never get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to improve your writing skills is to write (and to write a lot). If you’re focused on a process that helps you build new skills, most notably your ability to parse and process information tactfully, you cannot lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any skill that you hope to acquire, there is no magic moment. It’s a never-ending process of going from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/&quot;&gt;good to great&lt;/a&gt;. And certainly with writing, a post will never write itself, so it’s up to you to keep yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, there are few things more rewarding than looking back at a collection of work that you’ve delivered to the world that is indeed all your own. So get out there, design a process that works for you, and push forward with no intention of an expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has still often been difficult to find answers to my questions. I think this is largely due to the fact that when discussing things with the average Haskell programmer, I feel like I have a fourth-grade education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the material on Haskell online seems to have been written by and for people with four more brains than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re coming to Haskell from another language, or if you’re interested in writing programs that, y’know, actually &lt;em&gt;do things&lt;/em&gt;, participating in the Haskell community can feel like you’re a second class citizen. Between the lack of solid documentation for many popular libraries, to the deluge of posts and articles about the hottest new effect programming sudofunctor, it seems as though you need 2 PhDs in programming language theory just to write Hello World. Picking up any other language seems like a straightforward endeavor; read a few tutorials, try to write a project that interests you, and you’re off. Why is Haskell so much more intimidating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve already learned another language, you can learn Haskell.&lt;/strong&gt; And even if you haven’t, learning Haskell is no harder than learning any other programming language.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;clean-slate-body&quot; href=&quot;https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html#clean-slate-foot&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do all these advanced features seem so important when you’re learning Haskell? Because they’re all that anyone ever seems to talk about. No one talks about the boring, meat-and-potatoes parts of the language, because to anyone that has written Haskell for years and years, those parts come as naturally as breathing. But as a result, the perception of what tools, libraries, and concepts are important ends up distorted by novelty and excessive cleverness. If you strip this away, you’ll find that a lot of things that people talk about end up being unnecessary for writing practical programs. In particular, here are some things that you emphatically do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need to understand in order to write real Haskell programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;category theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lambda calculus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;laziness-body&quot; href=&quot;https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html#laziness-foot&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monad transformers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effect algebras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recursion schemes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template Haskell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proof languages like Coq and Agda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language extensions other than &lt;code&gt;-XOverloadedStrings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the abstract math stuff is utterly fascinating, but generally you don’t actually need to understand any of it to get work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, it will feel frustrating because you will know how to solve the problem in [some other language] but not in Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you need to write real Haskell? The core of the language is extremely simple. If you understand how to write and use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pure functions and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pattern matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sum and product types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to glue together &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; to make side effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;then you already have everything you need to write useful programs that solve real-world problems. With just these few concepts, you have everything you need to build anything you could build in Java, or Python, or Ruby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of valuable Haskell tools that don’t go beyond anything more complicated than &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-XOverloadedStrings&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/&quot;&gt;Hakyll&lt;/a&gt; powers the site you’re reading right now, and it doesn’t use any complicated language extension-based machinery or monad stacks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson&quot;&gt;Aeson&lt;/a&gt; powers JSON handling for the vast majority of Haskell code, and it doesn’t do anything fancy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; powers tons of datetime handling, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mysql-simple&quot;&gt;mysql-simple&lt;/a&gt; provides database access… you get the idea. None of these packages rely on advanced concepts to implement their core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does not having to learn these concepts right off the bat mean that there’s no point &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; learning them? That we should all just abandon our effect algebras and category theory-based abstractions? No, of course not. If you’re choosing to learn Haskell, you’re probably naturally curious. Someone suggesting that you not bother understanding how things really work may as well suggest that you sell your mother to the mafia. But don’t force your forehead to get well-acquainted with brick walls made of type errors. Put aside the things with high learning curves for another day, and get something that &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually you’ll be able to scale the mountain of abstractions that Haskell has to offer. You’ll give up a little bit of type-safety here, some static guarantees there. Remember that even with just the four core concepts we outlined above, you’re &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; getting more confidence from your compiler than any other language out there.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;other-languages-body&quot; href=&quot;https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html#other-languages-foot&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And the great thing about Haskell is that you can incrementally upgrade to more advanced tools and frameworks, even within the same project. The strictness of the compiler grades your “test”; you’ll know once you’ve gotten it right. You can add in the ability for, say, restricting only certain parts of your codebase to be able to access the DB, allowing only some other parts to make HTTP requests, and so on, using &lt;code&gt;freer-simple&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt;. You can try out a new way of structuring your tree transformations using &lt;code&gt;recursion-schemes&lt;/code&gt;. And if you’re happy with your program, you can leave it working as is. There’s an endless amount of things to learn, but there’s nothing wrong with taking it at your own speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time you find yourself banging your head against a screen’s worth of language extensions, take a step back from the heavyweight solution and see if you can solve things using something simpler, or something you already understand. Do you need the static guarantees of Servant, or can you get away with using Scotty? Do you need type-safe queries using Beam or Squeal, or can you get away with using &lt;code&gt;postgresql-simple&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;rdbms-body&quot; href=&quot;https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html#rdbms-foot&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Do you need to add permissions to your code using monad transformers, or is just IO enough? And on a simpler level, do you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to express some logic using a fold or a map, or can you get away with just writing out a recursive function yourself? You’ll probably find that the problem wasn’t as hard as you made it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something in your codebase that you feel like you’re overthinking? Got a comment? &lt;a href=&quot;https://williamyaoh.com/contact.html&quot;&gt;Talk to me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-might-also-like&quot;&gt;You might also like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup/&gt; In fact, it might even be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; if you approach learning Haskell without any programming experience; it means that you won’t have to unlearn any concepts from previous languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup/&gt; You can write programs assuming that they evaluate values strictly and probably not run into any major problems. It might even be a good idea to enable the &lt;code&gt;-XStrict&lt;/code&gt; GHC extension when starting out, just to make performance simpler to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big exception to this is if you plan on doing multicore parallelism, in which case you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to care about laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup/&gt; Unless you’re coming from an ML, Scala, or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup/&gt; Or equivalent simple library for your RDBMS of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;October 3rd, 2019&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/author/maarten/&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Maarten Vinkhuyzen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.spreadshirt.com/CleanTechnica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-121003&quot; src=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/04/CleanTechnica-store-cleantech-news-tesla-solar-wind-electric-vehicles-news.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally Norway is the biggest Tesla market in Europe. When the Dutch market absorbs nearly three times the Norwegian number of Model 3s, that is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric cars are far better known in Norway than in the Netherlands. In Norway, there was a huge pile of orders waiting when the first ship from Fremont arrived. In the rest of Europe, not so much. Europe has to wake up to this new type of car. The Zoes, the Leafs, and the i3s were toys for a small group of treehuggers. The big Teslas were toys for the rich, and there was nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Tesla Model 3 is changing all that. The growing awareness is supported by the Volkswagen ID.3 as well as Peugeot, Opel, Audi, Jaguar, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, and Porsche all asking for attention for their fully electric offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe is waking up slowly, warming to these new type of cars. The first on the mainland is the Dutch market. Supported by a lavish incentive, these electric autos are a better offer then nearly any competitor in the C- or D-segment (aka compact and midsize cars). Germany is waking up more slowly. The UK will see an explosion in the next fiscal year with a new incentive scheme. But back to the Netherlands. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2019/10/02/tesla-demand-cliff-mistaken-logic-tribal-tslaq-kool-aid-fraud/&quot;&gt;stories about demand falling off a cliff (now debunked)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2019/10/02/tesla-delivered-97000-vehicles-globally-in-3rd-quarter/&quot;&gt;97,000 deliveries of Q3, 79,600 being Model 3s&lt;/a&gt;, is great news. That those silly Dutch bought nearly 9.5%, or 7,547, of those Model 3s was rather unexpected. Additionally, the Model S &amp;amp; X are recovering from the dip that followed the spike in demand in late 2018, extra confirmation that Tesla is a healthy brand in this region. Both reached about a hundred units in the quarter. Without the customers making the Tesla stretch any more, these sales come again within the same size as the sales by the competition from BMW and Mercedes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the Tesla sales really into perspective, below are the top brands and to models in the Netherlands in September and January–September sales numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the January–September period, the Tesla Model 3 accounted for 4.1% of Dutch auto sales, while the #2 VW Polo accounted for 2.9%. In the month of September, the Model 3 represented 15.1% of new registrations (and the Tesla brand as a whole 15.5% of new registrations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important comment to make about Dutch and European sales numbers: The monthly numbers show the result of production and logistics planning for that month. The yearly numbers are more of a demand indicator. This is completely different from the USA, where the sales are from stock and the monthly numbers basically reflect the current demand for the brand and model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am already waiting for the European numbers for Q4. Not only those of Tesla, but the whole EV market, which is starting to take off. I expect the European numbers to show that the Netherlands is not the only country where Tesla is gaining in popularity. The biggest problem for Tesla in Europe is not a bad reputation, it is having no reputation, being mostly unknown and not having a sales location within reach. Even without incentives, the Tesla Model 3 can compete with the BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, and Jaguar models in the same class on price and beat them on total cost of ownership (TCO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch numbers are inflated by lavish incentives. In the next fiscal year, the incentives in the UK will be even more lavish. This is not the last time we will see this &lt;em&gt;demand problem&lt;/em&gt; in Europe. Eventually, it has to be solved by a European Gigafactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;dbf0&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Being a freelance WebGIS developer, it is very frequent for me to decide what tools I’ll need for my next project. Now after a few years of experience, this decision has become a bit easier because of prior knowledge and I thought I should share it with all those who want to build a Geospatial Webapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a53d&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Before you read further, I want you to know two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;a220&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma&quot;&gt;All the tools that I’ll discuss in this blog are free and/or opensource, won’t talk about paid and/or proprietary tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;1675&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mb lp mc lr md lt me lv mf lx ly lz ma&quot;&gt;These tools can be used to build a small to medium scale web application. They will be able to work at scale with a lot of users but might or might not be able to handle very large geospatial datasets. If you want to handle large geospatial datasets in your web app, you might want to read “&lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-work-with-big-geospatial-data-4ba919a8ffc2&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;How to work with BIG Geospatial Data&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a876&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;The most important part of a Geospatial web Application is the frontend where all the data is visualized which is the main focus in about 90% of geospatial web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;8ef5&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Leaflet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;58da&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;For the frontend, my first priority is &lt;a href=&quot;https://leafletjs.com/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt; which is a lightweight javascript library for creating web maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0387&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;The reason why I recommend it is because it is very simple to use and the map looks pretty modern. There is also a huge number of Leaflet &lt;a href=&quot;https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; developed by the opensource community. One plugin that I’d particularly like to mention here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://humangeo.github.io/leaflet-dvf/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Leaflet Data Visualization Framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Leaflet Data Visualization framework
&lt;p id=&quot;5da1&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Some of the prominent sites/portals that use Leaflet include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?query=&amp;amp;srchType=A&amp;amp;useMap=1&amp;amp;minAsk=&amp;amp;maxAsk=&amp;amp;bedrooms=&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;USGS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windy.com/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Windy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.data.gov/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;efb2&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Openlayers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9bcc&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;My next recommendation for web mapping library after Leaflet is &lt;a href=&quot;https://openlayers.org&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Openlayers&lt;/a&gt;. You should use it when you need to do some advanced data manipulation and/or display on the web map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;99f6&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Openlayers provides more functionalities as compared to Leaflet but on the downside, the learning curve of Openlayers is steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

Openlayers
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a6ba&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;GeoExt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;07b1&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://geoext.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GeoExt&lt;/a&gt; is a complete and very powerful Javascript framework used for building ‘desktop-like’ geospatial interfaces on the web. It combines the mapping functionality of &lt;a href=&quot;http://openlayers.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenLayers&lt;/a&gt; with the user interface of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ExtJS&lt;/a&gt; library and lets you create great Geospatial interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1433&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Turf.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;113f&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Another very useful library for the frontend is &lt;a href=&quot;https://turfjs.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Turf.&lt;/a&gt;js. It is a Javascript library so you can also use it on the backend as well if you are using Node.js. It allows a lot of manipulation of geospatial data which comes handy in some cases if you can do it on the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

Turf.js

&lt;p id=&quot;8ab0&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;In a geospatial web app, a lot is going on in the backend. Most of the data manipulation and querying is done there. So it is important to choose the backend wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3ede&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;For building a geospatial web app, I’ll always recommend Python for the backend. The reason for that is because Python is very popular in the GIS community and hence a lot of powerful geospatial libraries are available in Python. These python libraries include &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;Shapely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://geopandas.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;GeoPandas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdal.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;GDAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;PyProj&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Building the backend in Python enables you to use these libraries in your backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b9d9&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;GeoDjango&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ae10&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;The framework I always use for the backend of a Geospatial web application is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.djangoproject.com/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And I’ve got a lot of reasons for it. First of all, it is the most popular web framework in Python so there’s a lot of community support available. Secondly, being a Python framework, it allows you to integrate all those powerful Geospatial libraries (we talked about above) in your backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6a90&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;The best part of it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;lm od&quot;&gt;GeoDjango&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is a sub-framework of Django. You can just integrate it into your Django project by adding django.contrib.gis in your installed apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c617&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;It lets you store &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/model-api/#spatial-field-types&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;geospatial data&lt;/a&gt; types, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/db-api/#database-functions&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; different geospatial databases, create geospatial forms, make geospatial queries, have a geospatially enabled admin panel, create &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/db-api/#spatial-lookup-compatibility&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;geospatial lookups&lt;/a&gt;, serialize Geojson objects, and do a lot more. It also comes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/gdal/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GDAL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/geos/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GEOS&lt;/a&gt; APIs integrated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3a2c&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Another great thing about Geodjango is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/djangonauts/django-rest-framework-gis&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Django-rest-framework-gis&lt;/a&gt; which is a geospatial addon for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.django-rest-framework.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Django Rest Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you create APIs that send your data as Geojson which is an extremely popular format and can be ingested by all mapping libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6c36&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Geoserver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d41f&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;GeoServer is an open-source server for sharing geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/is&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;fe45&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Geoserver is built in Java which runs on Apache tomcat. Using its UI, you can publish your geospatial data as web services without needing to code even one line. It supports both Raster and Vector data and is quite helpful when the main goal of your web app is to display data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0750&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Your Geospatial data needs to be stored in a Geospatial database and we have different options for that like PostGIS, Mysql Spatial, Oracle Spatial, MongoDB, Spatialite, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0e81&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx&quot;&gt;Among these, I always prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://postgis.net/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PostGIS&lt;/a&gt; which is the spatial extension of PostgreSQL. I like it because of the fact that it is the most mature geospatial database out there and supports more Geospatial operations and functions as compared to its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;d734&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Many times there’s a need to preprocess the geospatial data before being able to ingest it in the web application. So I’ll talk about the tools I use for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2bcb&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;QGIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;01fe&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;QGIS is the most extensive free and opensource GIS software. It supports almost all sorts of geospatial operations and caters to almost all of my data preprocessing needs. The best thing about it is that (unlike Esri GIS) it is cross-platform compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;36ad&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Mapshaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9b82&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Another great tool for data preprocessing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mapshaper&lt;/a&gt;. It is a very simple site that allows for very simple operations like data format conversion, data simplification, and data visualization. It only works with vector data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;d804&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Many times you need to get the data from somewhere to add to your geospatial web app. For this, the two sources I like the most are OSM and Diva-GIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dbc1&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;OSM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8d50&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is an opensource competitor of Google maps and being opensource, its data is publicly available to download via UI and APIs. It is really helpful in many cases to get data from it. It also serves as Basemap in many web apps I develop. It also provides free routing and geocoding APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5c82&quot; class=&quot;nc ml ed aq ap eb nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn&quot;&gt;Diva-GIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6950&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;Another very convenient data source that I frequently use is &lt;a href=&quot;http://diva-gis.org/&quot; class=&quot;cx bv mg mh mi mj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diva-GIS&lt;/a&gt;. It provides free spatial data like different levels of administrative boundaries, railroads, roads, water, etc. It also provides global datasets about climate, species occurrence, crops, elevation, and others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;230c&quot; class=&quot;lk ll ed aq lm b ln mx lp my lr mz lt na lv nb lx&quot;&gt;There’s no fixed answer to the question “which tools you should use for your Geospatial web app?” Every web application is unique and so is the combination of tools and technologies that fit best for its requirements. There’s no hard and fast rule about it and usually, it is pretty flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CloudFlare is ruining the internet for me (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.slashgeek.net/2016/05/17/cloudflare-is-ruining-the-internet-for-me/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.slashgeek.net/2016/05/17/cloudflare-is-ruining-the-internet-for-me/</guid>
<description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slashgeek.net/2016/06/07/cloudflare-making-internet-little-bit-faster-select-group-people/&quot;&gt;Follow up: Cloudflare: Making the internet a little bit faster – for a select group of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; is a very helpful service if you are a website owner and don’t want to deal with separate services for CDN, DNS, basic DDOS protection and other (superficial) security needs. You can have all these services in a one stop shop and you can have it all for free. It’s hard to pass up the offer and go for a commercial solution. Generally speaking, CloudFlare service is as stable as they come, their downtime and service interruption are within the same margin as other similar services, at least to my experience. I know this because I have used them for two of my other websites, until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the users? If you live in a First World Country then for the most part you probably wouldn’t notice much difference, other than better speed and response time for the websites using CloudFlare services, you will be happy to know that because of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/network-map/&quot;&gt;multiple datacenter locations&lt;/a&gt; mostly in USA, Canada, Europe and China, short downtimes won’t result in service interruptions for you because you will be automatically rerouted to their nearest CloudFlare data center and they have plenty to go around within the first world countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the rest of us? I can only talk about my experience, I live in South East Asia (SEA). As it is normally the case for us we are treated as second class citizens on the Internet, often most premium, and sometimes freemium services, are limited to developed nations. We have to resort of Proxies and VPNs to enjoy the same freedom internet users from developed nations are used to. But other than that, for the most part, we enjoy the same basic internet freedom as rest of the most of the world. Unless of course your website is using CloudFlare services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cloudflare-facebook.png?resize=486%2C376&quot; alt=&quot;cloudflare-facebook&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1289&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cloudflare-facebook.png?w=486&amp;amp;ssl=1 486w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cloudflare-facebook.png?resize=300%2C232&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see CloudFlare has these &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203366080-Why-do-I-see-a-captcha-or-challenge-page-Attention-Required-trying-to-visit-a-site-protected-by-CloudFlare-as-a-site-visitor-&quot;&gt;“Security” features&lt;/a&gt; which can prompt users belonging to certain IP blocks, countries, blacklists or behavioral patterns and either automatically block you to visit some sites (rare, but often done by Site Owners discretion) or prompt you for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html&quot;&gt;reCAPTCHA&lt;/a&gt; (much better than the ridiculous captcha they had before), before you can visit the site. reCAPTCHA prompts happens a lot, I know its only one click away, but we shouldn’t have to deal with this annoying pseudo security measure. The entirety of the StackExchange sites is under CloudFlare firewall. As it is often the case, a lot of my searches often end up to one of the StackExchange sites and if I visit the link through Google search results I am prompted for captcha, but curiously I don’t get prompted if I directly visit the site. I wish it was only limited to StackExchange, because of CloudFlare’s ludicrous free one-stop shop offering and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners/&quot;&gt;aggressive partnership with cheap hosting service&lt;/a&gt;, every joe with a website is using CloudFlare. So that one click per site per day often results in 30-40 clicks per day or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish it was something to do with only my IP. You see I co-own an ISP, we have four /22 IP blocks (4096 IPs) while I didn’t get a chance to test all our IPs but all of them I have personally checked (about 500+) over the last year gets prompted for captchas. It’s not only limited to our IP blocks, It happens on my phone when I am using my telco’s internet or services from a couple of dozen of ISPs I have tried in my country. We often do market research for service quality of our competition, so it happens a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/network-map-e1463471996476.png?resize=900%2C390&quot; alt=&quot;network-map&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1284&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a second part of this CloudFlare annoyance. CF being a CDN, its strength lies in having redundancy all around the world. So, in theory, their service should work even if their closest node goes down. But their data centers or nodes are not evenly distributed around the world, so if my closest CloudFlare node becomes unavailable my traffic get rerouted to a node that could be a lot further from my location, which results in increased latency and invalidating the whole point of having a CDN in the first place. This is exactly what happened on May 13, two of my closest nodes in SEA, &lt;strong&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;New Delhi&lt;/strong&gt;, was down for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/&quot;&gt;scheduled maintenance&lt;/a&gt;. For whatever reason instead of traffic being rerouted to the closest nodes (which wasn’t very close to me in the first place), all CloudFlare hosted sites would either not work or was heavily broken because static files weren’t loading. This includes Reddit and StackExchange. This is not the first time it happened, but this was probably the longest duration so far with approximately 4-5 hours worth of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a single company can negatively influence the experience of such a large portion of the internet for users is kinda scary. I would urge everyone to reconsider using CloudFlare as your CDN/DNS/DDOS solution. Being free is not good enough reason to use something, if you are concerned about your site speed there are more important things to look into for optimization before considering a CDN. DDOS might be a good reason to choose CloudFlare, but only small portion of total users probably gets affected by DDOS anyways. Not to mention their free tier doesn’t cover the complex DDOS attacks that you really should be concerned about. So something that you configured because its free to use and relatively easy to setup because of its integration to most cheap hosts, turns out to be a nuisance to a large part of the internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c31&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research presents VPN⁰&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the first distributed virtual private network offering a privacy preserving traffic authorization and validation mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research was conducted by Dr. Matteo Varvello (Performance Researcher at Brave), Iñigo Querejeta-Azurmendi (intern at Brave), Dr. Panagiotis Papadopoulos (Security Researcher at Brave), Gonçalo Pestana (Research Engineer at Brave) and Dr. Ben Livshits (Brave’s Chief Scientist).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c31&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;istributed virtual private networks (dVPNs) are a new form of VPN with no central authority.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a dVPN,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are both VPN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;relay/exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt; nodes as in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. While dVPNs make strong privacy claims, they also carry the risk that a user will inadvertently have their machine used to transmit potentially harmful or illegal network traffic. Several incidents have been reported [2] where unaware dVPN users have been (ab)used as exit nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our prior&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://brave.com/analysis-of-dvpns/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://brave.com/analysis-of-dvpns/&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we analyzed several dVPN proposals and reported a lack of (i) performance, (ii) privacy guarantees, (iii) traffic accountability. In this post, we tackle these issues by introducing&lt;/span&gt; VPN⁰&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;, to the best of our knowledge the first  distributed virtual private network offering a privacy preserving traffic authorization and validation system.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c31&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;span class=&quot;c25&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is founded on the idea that dVPN nodes should be able to decide which traffic they want to carry.  For example, a dVPN node may only be willing to transmit network traffic related to news websites. To guarantee user privacy, this property should be achieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;without learning the contents of the traffic a VPN user is transmitting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;presents a novel method for simultaneously achieving both of these goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have integrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c25&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with BitTorrent’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;DHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT&quot;&gt;Mainline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com/&quot;&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a popular VPN provider. We demonstrate the feasibility of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c25&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;also benchmark its performance with respect to DHT lookup, VPN tunnel setup, and zero-knowledge traffic attestation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VPN⁰ Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; allows relay nodes to control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;which&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; traffic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they transmit, without learning&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;what&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; content it contains,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;through a novel application of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;zero knowledge proofs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A zero knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique that allows a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;prover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to prove to a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;verifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that a certain statement is true, without disclosing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; information&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;except the validity of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;statement. In our case,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a&lt;/span&gt; VPN⁰&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; wants to prove to a&lt;/span&gt; VPN⁰&lt;span&gt; relay that the traffic it is sending is contained within the relay’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;whitelist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;, or a set of domains the relay is willing to carry traffic for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several challenges exist to realize this goal in a decentralized system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In the following, we present each challenge along with a high level description of the solution we have devised. The interested reader can find a complete and more technical description of each solution in our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00159&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;Challenge 1: Private Whitelist Sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-right-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/files_2019-9-23/image-diagram-circle.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c50&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c25 c33&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;Flow of a connection using VPN-zero. First, nodes announce their whitelists. Then, when a user wants to connect to a domain,  it first uses a temporary VPN, and then performs a lookup to find the node to create an authorized VPN with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPN⁰&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;leverages a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Distributed Hash Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt; (DHT) — a class of distributed systems that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table — to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;privately&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;locate at least&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt; node willing to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;act as VPN relay node for some specific traffic. To this end, VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; nodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;announce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the DHT each entry of their whitelists using the hash of the domain name as a key, and as a value the domain's public key and their current public IP address.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; clients leverage the DHT to  privately lookup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt; nodes willing to serve their content.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Figure 1 shows an example of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;both&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;announce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  (magenta dashed line) and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (blue dashed line) operations.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Challenge 2:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Zero-Knowledge Traffic Proof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VPN⁰ client is required to prove to a VPN⁰ relay that the traffic it is sending is contained within the node's whitelist, in zero knowledge. This is achieved by piggybacking on TLS to build a proof of visit. Precisely, on the information derived from the encryption of the Server Name Indication (SNI) field in the ClientHello (as discussed in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-03&quot;&gt;RFC draft&lt;/a&gt; related to TLS v1.3). While VPN⁰ can be extended to work with regular TLS v1.3 as well as v1.2, the less private nature of such traffic would allow snoopy relay nodes to potentially violate the privacy of a VPN⁰ client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the DHT lookup, a VPN⁰ client receives the relay's IP willing to take the corresponding traffic and an encryption of the accessed service provider's public key — the one present in the certificate of the website the client is accessing. Combining this encrypted public key with the encrypted SNI gives enough tools to the VPN⁰ client to prove that the service being accessed corresponds, with high probability, to a service announced as authorized during the private whitelist sharing phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to produce this proof, the TLS v1.3 handshake together with the RFC extension discussed above &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; happen through the relay. If the proof presented by the VPN⁰ client verifies correctly, and the TLS handshake succeeds, the relay is convinced that the server for which it is acting as a relay is, with a high probability, among its whitelisted services; this probability captures the prevalence of honest nodes in the system. A potential avenue of attack here is a collusion between the relay and the DHT node(s) responsible for announce/lookup operations for a domain. This translates into a sybil attack, a popular attack on the DHT for which many countermeasures exist [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Challenge 3:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;Balancing Performance and Strict Privacy Guarantees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;aims to offer strict privacy guarantees with no performance penalty for its users. We achieve so by introducing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt;VPN chains.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;When a VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; wants to visit a domain, it first opens a classic VPN connection to any VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; node. In the background,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3 c6&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; software privately locates a second node which is willing to carry this specific traffic, and forward all the cryptographic material required (see F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;igure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; 1 and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00159&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;for a detailed description of the protocol execution).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;When found, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt;temporary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN relay transparently chains the first VPN tunnel with a new VPN tunnel towards the designated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c15 c1 c3&quot;&gt; node,  with no noticeable impact at the user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/files_2019-9-23/image-wireshark.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c50&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;TCP and TLS connection (re)negotiation triggered by a VPN⁰ chain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;The latter operation has two main effects. First, it provides continuation of VPN service while the privacy preserving protocol is executed. Second, it allows the actual VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6 c3&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;node to verify, in zero knowledge, that the ongoing traffic is allowed. This is possible because the remote website will notice a change in the underlying TCP connection, i.e., a new socket endpoint and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; wrong TCP sequence number, causing a TCP RST — see in Figure 2 the wireshark log of a TCP RST triggered when accessing Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This will travel back to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c3&quot;&gt; the VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; client forcing a new TCP handshake and thus TLS handshake.&lt;/span&gt; This new TLS handshake can now be observed by the final exit node. The SNI encryption in the new ClientHello is used to verify (in zero knowledge) that the destination domain is within its whitelist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c30 c1 c43&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To make sure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; design can support real world use,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we integrated it with Mainline (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BitTorrent DHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with tens of millions of users), and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c55&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com&quot;&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (a popular VPN provider). We further use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c55&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://openvpn.net/&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt; to run the first VPN path on a Raspberry Pi under our control.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/files_2019-9-23/image-raspberry-pi.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c50&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;High level overview of VPN⁰’s prototype.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows a graphical representation of our testbed. A headless browser runs on a laptop (node S) and it is instrumented to visit a TLSv1.3-enabled website. The laptop connection is tunneled through a Raspberry Pi (node X) located in the same LAN as S; note that this is a worst case scenario for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; since the extra network latency would further hide the latency of the traffic verification process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whenever a new website visit is initiated, node X performs a DHT query in Mainline.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;As input for the DHT query, we use one of the top 100 magnet links (DHT hashes) as indicated by a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;popular indexing website for BitTorrent content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;. As soon as the DHT response is received, X opens a new tunnel to a random ProtonVPN server (node A) from the list provided with a basic subscription, and proceeds with setting up the VPN chain. Meanwhile, the ZKP is calculated at S to be then sent to A where the ZKP can be verified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of DHT lookup duration in the Mainline DHT for the 100 hashes under tests. Overall, we observe a uniform distribution between 1 and 20 seconds. Contributions to this delay are: diverse network paths taken by DHT lookups, failures along the path, lookup replication factor, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;float-right-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/files_2019-9-23/image-chart.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c50&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;CDF of DHT loop duration and VPN setup time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;The next operation, post DHT lookup, is the setup of the second leg of the VPN chain. The figure also shows the CDF of such VPN setup time computed for 72 VPN nodes — 96 nodes were tested but 24 failed, i.e., negotiation did not succeed within 30 seconds. This high failure rate is potentially due to a ProtonVPN protection for too  frequent switches. The figure shows a median reconnect time of 4 seconds and worst case durations of up to 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, we benchmarked our ZKP calculation using a Python prototype implementation and measured an average of 10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This time is overall slower than both VPN chain setup and DHT lookup, and thus the current bottleneck of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It has to be noted that, from a user perspective, the setup time of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is as fast as a classic VPNs, e.g., in our demonstration as fast as ProtonVPN. This is because our design purposely hides the extra operations required, i.e.,  DHT lookup, VPN chain setup, and ZKP calculation The drawback is that, during this time, potentially unauthorized traffic can flow through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;VPN⁰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;From this analysis, our main future work consists in minimizing the duration of potential unauthorized traffic. We plan to achieve this via both protocol improvements (e.g., optimized DHT lookup and chain selection) and by switching to better performing languages (Rust, C++) for the ZKP calculation. We also plan to perform more comprehensive measurements under realistic VPN workloads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) are VPN solutions where users share their resources in exchange for other users bandwidth or, more recently, a cryptocurrency compensation [3][4][5][6]. &lt;span&gt;In our prior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://brave.com/analysis-of-dvpns/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c4&quot; href=&quot;https://brave.com/analysis-of-dvpns/&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we noted that&lt;/span&gt; existing dVPN designs fail to provide strong privacy guarantees. Most notably, their decentralized nature requires strong guarantees on the traffic a dVPN node carries without violating a user's privacy, at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;This post has presented VPN⁰, to the best of our knowledge, the first dVPN with strong privacy requirements and high performance. VPN⁰ is built around a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) atop of which we designed several privacy preserving mechanisms. Most notably, a strategy to prove, in zero knowledge, that a dVPN client is attempting to access a TLS domain. This information is used by dVPN nodes to only allow through them traffic they are willing to carry, without violating dVPN users’ privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;We integrated VPN⁰ with BitTorrent DHT and ProtonVPN, and benchmarked its performance. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach but they also highlight a need for more research to speed up VPN⁰’s zero knowledge calculations. We believe the strong privacy guarantees offered by VPN⁰ will foster the development of future VPN solutions and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;We foresee the ideas contained here to be the foundation of a decentralized VPN system, which may be combined with a set of incentives around a utility token such as BAT (Basic Attention Token). In a scenario like this, users carrying traffic would be compensated in BAT and users would pay for VPN services or subscriptions in BAT, as well. Care must be taken to make sure that token economic incentives keep this model continuously attractive for all participants and also that BAT payments cannot be used to deanonymize the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>VPN⁰: A Privacy-Preserving Distributed Virtual Private Network | Brave Browser</og:title>
<og:description>Distributed virtual private networks (dVPNs) are a new form of VPN with no central authority. In a dVPN, users are both VPN clients and relay/exit nodes as in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. While dVPNs make strong privacy claims, they also carry the risk that a user will inadvertently have their machine used to transmit potentially harmful or illegal network traffic. Several incidents have been reported [2] where unaware dVPN users have been (ab)used as exit nodes.</og:description>

<title>Google, Xiaomi, and Huawei affected by zero-day flaw that unlocks root access</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/10/04/google-xiaomi-and-huawei-devices-affected-by-zero-day-flaw-that-unlocks-root-access/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Google’s security group Project Zero have found an active vulnerability in Android that affects several popular devices including the Pixel 2, Huawei P20 Pro, and Xiaomi Redmi Note 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post from the security group suggests &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;it found the bug last week&lt;/a&gt;, and attackers were exploiting it at that moment. The post notes the exploit requires no or minimal customization to root a phone that’s exposed to the bug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research group has listed some of the devices affected that are running Android version 8.x or later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;Pixel 2 with Android 9 and Android 10 preview &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;Huawei P20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; Xiaomi Redmi 5A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi Redmi Note 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi A1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oppo A3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moto Z3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oreo LG phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samsung Galaxy S7, S8, S9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug was fixed in earlier versions – 3.18, 4.4, and 4.9 – of Android kernel, but it has resurfaced again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker can’t use Remote Code Execution (RCE) to exploit the vulnerability. However, if you install an application from an untrusted source, attackers can take advantage of that. Attackers can also take advantage of the bug if they pair it with vulnerabilities in the Chrome browser to render content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement from Android team says it has informed phone makers to issue a patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have notified Android partners and the patch is available on the Android Common Kernel. Pixel 3 and 3a devices are not vulnerable while Pixel 1 and 2 devices will be receiving updates for this issue as part of the October update.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate the bug is being used by NSO, an Isreal-based group known to sell tools to authorities to exploit iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s advisable that you don’t install apps from non-trustworthy sources, and use an alternate browser such as Firefox or Brave till the issue is fixed. We’ll keep you posted on any updates issued by phone makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This means crawling or using illegally obtained datasets then processing it with &quot;machine learning&quot; until you have enough plausible deniability to use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This could be used for bypassing copyrights. For example you can remix stock photos you don't want to pay for. You can crawl a competitor's dating network to build similar looking fake profiles. You can steal writings and automatically paraphrase it. You can steal algorithms by cloning their inputs/outputs. You can generate new porn by swapping faces and background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;An illegal dataset can also be used as a hidden input to improve your core product. For example you can buy up all stolen databases and logs and correlate the users. This can then be used for better ad targeting using data that isn't even available to google and facebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There is a huge space around &quot;&quot;&quot;fitness&quot;&quot;&quot; devices that are running around the FDA regulatory process. I think there is going to be a huge health revolution by making everybody take their weight, glucose, blood pressure, sleep statistics, and heart rate statistics every day and feed them into an AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The major techincal step forward that is happening is microneedles that can draw out interstitial fluid. The patient doesn't feel it, and you can do things like constant glucose monitoring, and constant cortisol monitoring (which is huge) completely uninvasively. It's going to be amazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The breakthrough device is going to be a watch that can sense glucose and cortisol all the time. A while ago there was some PG post about wanting a tricorder, well it's coming, and it's going to look like a watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Sidenote: if anybody reading this is working in any of the labs working with these microneedles, please contact me, I would love to collaborate with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Could you replace the needles somehow? Can you avoid having to replace the needles frequently?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Every worn device that I'm aware of that continuously interacts with the body in some way is either totally noninvasive (like a pulse oximeter that just shines light through a finger, or an EEG with external electrodes placed against the skin) or invasively and persistently attached to the bloodstream or an organ system (like an IV, an insulin pump, or an implantable defibrillator).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Or do you have to somehow deliberately engage and retract the needles when putting on and taking off the watch? But wouldn't they break, or something, when the watch moves around on your wrist?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Or do you apply a disposable or partly disposable sensor under adhesive tape to one part of the body, and then have the watch receive data from it using electrical or electromagnetic signals?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;7.9293286219081&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The way (these) continuous glucose monitors work is that there's an adhesive patch with the needle, sensor, some storage/processing and comms module. Attaching the patch is done via a spring-loaded module and the data is read by waving the reading over the patch. The patch itself lasts a couple of weeks before it deactivates itself and you need to apply a new one.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The patch/sensor doesn't hurt going in but depending on where it's attached and how you move it can sometimes pinch a bit when you move around. And you'll definitely feel it when you jostle it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are physical constraints concerning continuous glucose monitoring, you cannot simply replace the capillary blood with something drawn from skin tissues depth. It significantly lags the real blood glucose level and the water content screws up the measurement. Even the continuous glucose monitors that are implanted under the skin and that are significantly larger than anything a watch would do have issues with precision and lag compared to the blood prick method. It is worth it because of the better control loop, but its not a simple topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They are also more precise than it sounds like you think they are. I think that all current models require some calibration every once in a way (maybe every few days).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, there is a lag, but it is fairly predictable and for a lot of potential use cases the lag is not an issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;We already know, for instance, a bit about the beginnings of glucose dysregulation in the beginning of diabetes. If we could have more samples of &quot;continous&quot; glucose data from a person, then we could catch glucose dysregulation before it becomes either type 2 or type 1 diabetes (or something else). We'd thus be able to more easily keep someone at risk from getting type 2 diabetes through simple lifestyle interventions (which would be a lot easier to study with a lot of continuous glucose data) or if it is type 1 we could administer the BCG vaccine to keep them from losing their pancreatic function. That sounds like a revolution to me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, for obesity, it is known that lactate (and other metabolite) levels predict someones metabolic health and whether they have metabolic syndrome. If we had continuous lactate data or maybe BCAA data (this is probably one I'm not sure they can get easily with current tech) then we could find out when and why metabolic syndrome happens and how best to stop it and reverse it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c5a&quot;&gt;Tldw: within a small number of miles of shore it’s police or federal (USA I guess it’s similar for other countries). After that it’s up to the ship. Cruise companies don’t want crime statistics so are unlikely to do anything about petty crime. There is death on high seas act but that only helps for a blatant murder. Jurisdiction is the flag which is likely to be panama or Bahamas. Your living areas can be searched any time and security can lock you up in your cabin. Cruises seem horrible to me and there are reports in the news of fights breaking out. But the worst thing for me is why be stuck on a ship that has less to do than I can do in my home city?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Id also contend the spaceship is likely controllable remotely, and monitored in both location and status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Step 1: make a law declaring it illegal. Step 2: have undercover cop attempt an exchange, then arrest/fine the other party. Step 3: repeat until no one wants to exchange anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;34.878218510786&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;We've seen many businesses attempt to exploit the lack of regulation at their peril. Ride-sharing companies come to mind as one example.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think it is more useful to think of regulations in the context of history and societal values. For example, an oilspill off the shore of California helped galvanize support for the clean air movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Perhaps it is possible to hypergrow a business before regulation catches up. I think expecting such an outcome risks the long-term viability of a business, since ultimately its foundation rests upon trust in its brand. Companies (in a competitive environment at least) must earn goodwill from their customers to do well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I hope all entrepreneurs think about building businesses that can thrive even as regulations shift as society changes. In other words, build in some resilience into your business model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For example, you don't have to have a crystal ball to recognize when a business model over-relies on certain power imbalances. If you want to extract value from such power imbalances, don't be surprised when there is a backlash. For example, ride-sharing companies skirted with employee/contractor definitions. Flirting with this boundary is risky -- and naively hoping that one narrow interpretation is shared by society and lawmakers is, frankly, over-optimism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Realism combined with long-term thinking, I think, tends to lead to similar decisions as &quot;strive to do the right thing&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;44.901445466491&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Some general responses to &quot;that's not the question&quot;: There are different ways to respond to a question; some responses push back on the premise of the question. Some ask about the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; behind a question. Both are valuable. A mix of thoughtful responses is the whole idea.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are plenty of places for more constrained styles of discussions, such as any of the topical Stack Exchange web sites. HN is built for open-ended discussion, best I can tell, based on some years of using it. I regularly see comments meander somewhat; discussion takes many forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Anyhow, I'll try rewriting some of my arguments in a few different ways, in case it helps connect the dots:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;First, some people have a blanket view regarding regulated industries as 'lesser' opportunities (for starting a company or technical innovation in general). Such a generic belief may lead to the premature dismissal of opportunities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Second, what may appear to be &quot;unregulated&quot; at one point in time may not be a strong signal as to what happens going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Third, (and I didn't touch on this in my comment above) it might be useful to think of regulation as one signal that a market area is mature and predictable. (Think of this story: if you want to buy a house, which of the following two choices has more variability? House A in an incorporated city of 100,000 people with known zoning laws and a more-or-less predictable economic and political situation? Or house B at the edge of a sprawling city where an influx of people could lead to dozens of different outcomes? Choosing the best house depends on what outcomes you value and your risk tolerance. With regards to regulation, my point is to say that you can often use regulation to your advantage in choosing a business plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Fourth, as a general principle, understanding how a range of possible situations affects your objectives is more useful than simply &quot;avoiding regulation&quot;. Designing a new method to ingest nicotine that currently sidesteps regulation might work fine until one day it doesn't. You might want to know how regulators might respond to these sorts of situations. Hence my points about history and ethics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;These ideas are all connected and relevant. I hope this is of some value to those who seek unregulated (for now) opportunities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Like the speed of light, Planck's constant has units which is problematic (how can you define the meter in terms of the speed of light if the speed of light depends on the definition of the meter?) Thus, you simply assign a value to the constant to break the unit dependency.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't follow your thought process here. The speed of light has units, that's true. Being a speed, it has units of distance over time. But the question &quot;how can you define the meter in terms of the speed of light if the speed of light depends on the definition of the meter?&quot; is totally incoherent; the premise is wrong. The speed of light does not depend on the definition of the meter, making it very easy to define the meter in terms of the speed of light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To take a trivial example, the speed of light is 300,000,000 meters per second and 300,000 kilometers per second. If we relabeled kilometers &quot;flags&quot;, then the speed of light would &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be 300,000 flags per second. But while 300,000,000 and 300,000 are different &lt;em&gt;numbers&lt;/em&gt;, 300,000,000 meters and 300,000 flags are the same &lt;em&gt;distance&lt;/em&gt;. You can't change the speed of light by defining a new unit of length. You can only change the &lt;em&gt;coefficient&lt;/em&gt; of that unit that gives the speed of light. But coefficients are dimensionless and therefore aren't speeds. When you multiply the coefficient by the unit, you get the same constant speed as always.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I can't tell why you think it's &quot;problematic&quot; for a physical constant to have units, but I feel safe in saying that whatever you have in mind, it's wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree, I messed that up. What I meant to say was: &quot;how can the speed of light have an unchanging numerical value if the definition of the meter is not an unchanging definition?&quot; Prior to 2019 the meter was not defined in terms of speed of light over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My point is that, unlike dimensionless constants like pi, constants with units can have arbitrary numerical values depending on the definitions of the units. And if you make a law that changes the definition of a unit, you therefore change the numerical representation of the corresponding constants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In other words, if you defined a meter to be &quot;the distance light travels in 1 second&quot;, then the constant &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; would now be 1 m/s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; I can't tell why you think it's &quot;problematic&quot; for a physical constant to have units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Because the definitions of units can change[1]. The definition of the meter changed earlier this year, and thus the speed of light constant, &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; also changed. Before May 9, 2019, &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; had an infinite number of digits using SI units. Now it only has 9 digits. Planck's constant, along with a bunch of others changed as well during the units redefinition[1].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_ba...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Again, I'm not arguing that the speed of light can change, but that those constants are only unchangeable in their symbolic forms. Laws can and do change their numeric representations by proxy of defining units.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For example, according to Wikipedia, the second is defined thus:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For example, there are regulations in most states about ebikes, their motor capability and whether they have throttle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But these are also very regularly entirely unenforced (nyc not withstanding)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It seems often interesting phenomena may have _some_ regulation but it is not remotely enforced. In my mind this meets the threshold of cool unregulated stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Regulations range from &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you can burn, to &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you can do it, to &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; you can do it (example: outside fires not permitted within 50 feet of a building, or something along those lines). Sometimes there are outright bans on all outside burning during certain periods of time, when - due to weather conditions - there is a heightened risk of wildfires.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Really interesting post. My suggestion: Hacking the stock market with AI's, algos, and current results from neural-science research, and large, accurate historical datasets and analytic models. There are lots of regs that mandate &quot;prudent man&quot; behaviour for agents and brokers, and myriad regs around capital required to execute or margin trades - but the domain of research-gathering prior to trade execution - is essentially wide open for &quot;outsiders&quot;. Company officers face restrictions on when they can buy or sell company stock - but non-insiders have wide latitude, and in most cases are free to make buy/sell decisions whenever, and at any rate they wish to pay for. You are free to invest and speculate - and lose - your own money. And the neural-science on this is interesting. Most wealthy speculators in commodity markets, mostly lose. Most gamblers at casinos mostly lose. If you have wealth, you are able to give it away (or piss it away), without restriction, unless your family members can get you declared &quot;mentally not competent&quot;. Also, environments where very complex regulations exist, allow and encourage &quot;regulatory arbitrage&quot; - structures can be created which take advantage of various regime differences. But the fact remains, few regulations exist which can effectively prevent someone giving away, or destroying their own wealth. (I recall a fellow in Sweden, who was ordered by a divorce court to turn over half his wealth to a former wife. He withdrew over $100,000 in life savings in cash, and carefully burned it all.) People face few restrictions in disposing of wealth. Charities exploit this fact relentlessly. Also, there are few restrictions on attending school, or gaining education - except in truly horrible societies, such as religiously deluded cultures, which for example, prevent women from gaining education to maintain breeding stock. But civilized societies encourage education, and often subsidize it. The existence of unlocked libraries (in ancient times, they were almost always locked), and our western-cultural concept of freely available science information, remains the greatest unregulated open space. It is also where the greatest opportunity resides. Western culture is unique, in that it &quot;deregulated&quot; knowledge acquisition, and scientific inquiry in the early 1600's. And there remains a risk of &quot;re-regulation&quot; of science inquiry. Imagine a world run by book-burning god-believers. You don't have to imagine. You can study the historical examples. Quite possible that science knowledge may be restricted and access regulated in the future. But for now, gaining knowledge, using that knowledge to get rich, and then giving away the wealth accumulated, remains an essentially unregulated activity.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At some stage license plates will have to disappear, but then you move to facial recognition for cars and other meta data, they probably have unique sounds for instance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'd try and do a app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_barcode_games&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_barcode_games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You should know how to monetize it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(Obviously facial recognition works equally well here, but there is some regulatory attention, although none that would stop you)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'd also look at things like using neural nets to detect race and/or underlying genetic structure from visual, audio and other metadata.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.898336414048&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I am not sure why this comment was marked dead without any responses, and hence I am &quot;vouch&quot;-ing for it. Can someone point to laws related to license plate tracking?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It seems to me that having a huge database of known locations of vehicles could be used to do some cool (but likely immoral) things, specially coupled with the fact that several state agencies all over the world make it free and easy to retrieve licensing and ownership information for vehicles. It'd also be relatively much easier to do compared to facial recognition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.881756756757&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Big question is, how would you do it at scale? You can crowdsorce data, but then it's hardly precise or frequently updated data. Sort of a thing that vinwiki does now. Govt has a head start on it with speed cameras/traffic light cameras etc, but there only so many of them.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The wildest idea I can think of is using reverse camera on every car and recognizing the plate of the car which is tail gating you. Now, that's more interesting, but how much of a fleet you would need to track down a random car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not something car manufacturers would do either, even with their love of telemetry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In Spain is almost the same, you are dealing with personal data, if you automate that you have to notify people of that and they can request you to delete the data.&lt;/span&gt;
