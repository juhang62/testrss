<description>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;SIGBOVIK - Colin McMillen&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale: 1, user-scalable=no&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,300italic&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather+Sans:700,300,300italic&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;../style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;93% of Paint Splatters are Valid Perl Programs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGGNMfmfpWB-DzWS3Jr-YLcRNRjhp3FKS6v0KELxXK8/preview&quot;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.html&quot;&gt;view the gallery of pretty Perl programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we aim to answer a long-standing open problem in the programming languages community: &lt;em&gt;is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer this question in the affirmative: it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; possible to smear paint on the wall without creating a valid Perl program. We employ an empirical approach, using optical character recognition (OCR) software, which finds that merely 93% of paint splatters parse as valid Perl. We analyze the properties of paint-splatter Perl programs, and present seven examples of paint splatters which are not valid Perl programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;but is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?&lt;/p&gt;
— Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1095706032448393217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 13, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepted for publication at SIGBOVIK 2019, held April 1st 2019 in Pittsburgh. Winner of a Unwitting Participation Ribbon, &quot;an unwelcome brand we’ve affixed to each paper determined after careful scrutiny to have included a genuine artifact, thereby furthering the admirable causes of open science and fruitful procrastination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGGNMfmfpWB-DzWS3Jr-YLcRNRjhp3FKS6v0KELxXK8/preview&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; or download a &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/2019.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;. Or grab the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sigbovik.org/2019/proceedings.pdf&quot;&gt;entire SIGBOVIK 2019 proceedings&lt;/a&gt;; I'm on page 174.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Supplementary Materials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.html&quot;&gt;all the paint splatters&lt;/a&gt; on a single page, along with the valid Perl source code corresponding to each. &quot;Not valid&quot; is written in red for those images which did not parse as valid Perl programs. If different OCR settings recognized multiple valid Perl programs, I chose the one that seemed the most &quot;interesting&quot;, according to my own aesthetic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.tar.gz&quot;&gt;tarball of 100 paint-splatter images&lt;/a&gt; that were used as the main dataset for this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;source code not available yet because i am bad at GitHub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Errata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few paint splatter Perl programs that I didn't recognize as &quot;interesting&quot; until after the SIGBOVIK submission deadline. For example, this splatter is recognized by OCR as the string &lt;code&gt;lerzfijglpFiji-j&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/6b78f8696b05f9322b2dda21b6932776.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below is recognized as the string &lt;code&gt;-*?&lt;/code&gt;, which also evaluates to the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/e47b8463b359906947c66ec4c852a2a3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another surprising program is shown below; OCR recognizes this image as the string &lt;code&gt;;i;c;;#\\?z{;?;;fn':.;&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the string &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/803dd5a54c42ed93462c78ad7da357b0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this image is recognized as the string &lt;code&gt;;E,'__'&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the string E__ in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;49c9&quot; id=&quot;49c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Software engineers go crazy for the most ridiculous things. We like to think that we’re hyper-rational, but when we have to choose a technology, we end up in a kind of frenzy — bouncing from one person’s Hacker News comment to another’s blog post until, in a stupor, we float helplessly toward the brightest light and lay prone in front of it, oblivious to what we were looking for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c52&quot; id=&quot;0c52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is not how rational people make decisions, but it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; how software engineers decide to use MapReduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d64&quot; id=&quot;4d64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Joe Hellerstein sideranted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_NSKvCVFmk2E&quot; data-href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_NSKvCVFmk2E&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his undergrad databases class&lt;/a&gt; (54 min in):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is there’s like 5 companies in the world that run jobs that big. For everybody else… you’re doing all this I/O for fault tolerance that you didn’t really need. People got kinda Google mania in the 2000s: “we’ll do everything the way Google does because we also run the world’s largest internet data service” [tilts head sideways and waits for laughter]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9ngayPVvoHBf5Le7Uqw1dA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;743&quot; data-height=&quot;440&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*9ngayPVvoHBf5Le7Uqw1dA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9ngayPVvoHBf5Le7Uqw1dA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
How many stories are your data center buildings? Google chose to stop at 4, for this one in Mayes County, Oklahoma.
&lt;p name=&quot;7373&quot; id=&quot;7373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Having more fault tolerance than you need might sound fine, but consider the cost: not only would you be doing much more I/O, you might be switching from a mature system—with stuff like transactions, indexes, and query optimizers—to something relatively threadbare. What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/mapreduce_a_major_step_backwards.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/mapreduce_a_major_step_backwards.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major step backwards&lt;/a&gt;. How many Hadoop users make these tradeoffs consciously? How many of those users make these tradeoffs wisely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7a6&quot; id=&quot;f7a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;MapReduce/Hadoop is a soft target at this point because even the cargo culters have realized that the planes ain’t en route. But the same observation can be made more broadly: if you’re using a technology that originated at a large company, but your use case is very different, it’s unlikely that you arrived there deliberately; no, it’s more likely you got there through a ritualistic belief that imitating the giants would bring the same riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0dd2&quot; id=&quot;0dd2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Ok, so yes: this is another “don’t cargo cult” article. But wait! I have a helpful checklist for you, one you can use to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b256&quot; id=&quot;b256&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Cool Tech? UNPHAT.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22b2&quot; id=&quot;22b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Next time you find yourself Googling some cool new technology to (re)build your architecture around, I urge you to stop and follow &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UNPHAT&lt;/strong&gt; instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4d1b&quot; id=&quot;4d1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t even start considering solutions until you &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt; the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; domain, not the solution domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6612&quot; id=&quot;6612&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;eNumerate&lt;/strong&gt; multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8e4f&quot; id=&quot;8e4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Consider a candidate solution, then read the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt; if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2df9&quot; id=&quot;2df9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Determine the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Historical context&lt;/strong&gt; in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8f7d&quot; id=&quot;8f7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Weigh &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt; against disadvantages. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Determine what was de-prioritized&lt;/em&gt; to achieve what &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;843d&quot; id=&quot;843d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Think!&lt;/strong&gt; Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind?&lt;/em&gt; For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you’d elect &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use Hadoop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;d47c&quot; id=&quot;d47c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You Are Also Not Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;999b&quot; id=&quot;999b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It’s pretty straightforward to apply UNPHAT. Consider my recent conversation with a company that briefly considered using Cassandra for a read-heavy workflow over data that was loaded in nightly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90ae&quot; id=&quot;90ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Having read the Dynamo paper, and knowing Cassandra to be a close derivative, I understood that these distributed databases prioritize &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;write availability&lt;/em&gt; (Amazon wanted the “add to cart” action to never fail). I also appreciated that they did this by compromising consistency, as well as basically every feature present in a traditional RDBMS. But the company I was speaking with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; need to prioritize write availability since the access pattern called for one big write per day. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*2c9zLYMMHf0SMJRCs2rtUg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;600&quot; data-height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2c9zLYMMHf0SMJRCs2rtUg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Amazon sells a lot of stuff. If “add to cart” occasionally failed, they would lose a lot of money. Is your use case the same?
&lt;p name=&quot;b4eb&quot; id=&quot;b4eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This company considered Cassandra because the PostgreSQL query in question was taking minutes, which they figured was a hardware limitation. After a few questions, we determined that the table was around 50 million rows and 80 bytes wide, so would take around 5 seconds to to be read in its entirety off SSD, if a full FileScan were needed. That’s slow, but it’s 2 orders of magnitudes faster than the actual query. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53cf&quot; id=&quot;53cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this point, I really wanted to ask more questions (understand the problem!) and had started weighing up about 5 strategies for when the problem grew (enumerate multiple candidate solutions!), but it was already pretty clear that Cassandra would have been the wrong solution entirely. All they needed was some patient tuning, perhaps re-modeling some of the data, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; (but probably not) another technology choice… but certainly not the high-write availability key value store that Amazon created for its shopping cart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d580&quot; id=&quot;d580&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Furthermore, You Are Not LinkedIn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a931&quot; id=&quot;a931&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I was surprised to discover that one student’s company had chosen to architect their system around Kafka. This was surprising because, as far as I could tell, their business processed just a few dozen very high value transactions per day—perhaps a few hundred on a good day. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;At this throughput, the primary datastore could be a human writing into a physical book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2da8&quot; id=&quot;2da8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In comparison, Kafka was designed to handle the throughput of all the analytics events at LinkedIn: a monumental number. Even a couple of years ago, this amounted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/running-kafka-scale&quot; data-href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/running-kafka-scale&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around 1 trillion events per day, with peaks of over 10 million messages per second&lt;/a&gt;. I understand that Kafka is still useful for lower throughput workloads, but 10 orders of magnitude lower?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*58fByP3ysdAKFlbH_KAWRQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;512&quot; data-height=&quot;320&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*58fByP3ysdAKFlbH_KAWRQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The sun, while massive, is only 6 orders of magnitude larger than earth.
&lt;p name=&quot;3874&quot; id=&quot;3874&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Perhaps the engineers really &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make an informed decision based on their expected needs and a good understanding of the rationale of Kafka. But my guess is that they fed off the community’s (generally justifiable) enthusiasm around Kafka and put little thought into whether it was the right fit for the job. I mean… 10 orders of magnitude!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4387&quot; id=&quot;4387&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You Are Not Amazon, Again&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86c5&quot; id=&quot;86c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;More popular than Amazon’s distributed datastore is the architectural pattern they credit with enabling them to scale: service-oriented architecture. As Werner Vogels pointed out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065&quot; data-href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this 2006 interview by Jim Gray&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon realized in 2001 that they were struggling to scale their front end, and that a service-oriented architecture ended up helping. This sentiment reverberated from one engineer to another, until startups with just a few engineers and barely any users started splintering their brochureware app into nanoservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e37&quot; id=&quot;2e37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But by the time Amazon decided to move to SOA, &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/2001annualreport.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/2001annualreport.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they had around 7,800 employees and did over $3 billion in sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;398&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Bill Graham Auditorium in San Francisco has capacity for 7,000 people. Amazon had around 7,800 employees when it moved to SOA.
&lt;p name=&quot;6cd7&quot; id=&quot;6cd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That’s not to say you should hold off on SOA until you reach the 7,800 employee mark… just, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Is it the best solution to your problem? What is your problem exactly, and what are other ways you could solve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;46e6&quot; id=&quot;46e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you tell me that your 50-person engineering organization would grind to a halt without SOA, I’m going to wonder why so many larger companies do just fine with a large but well-organized single application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f46e&quot; id=&quot;f46e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even Google Is Not Google&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;718d&quot; id=&quot;718d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Use of large scale dataflow engines like Hadoop and Spark can be particularly funny: very often a traditional DBMS is better suited to the workload, and sometimes the volume of data is so small that it could even fit &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;in memory.&lt;/em&gt; Did you know you can buy a terabyte of RAM for around $10,000? Even if you had a billion users, this would give you 1kB &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;of RAM&lt;/em&gt; per user to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;759e&quot; id=&quot;759e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Perhaps this isn’t enough for your workload, and you will need to read and write back to disk. But do you need to read and write back to literally thousands of disks? How much data do you have exactly? GFS and MapReduce were created to deal with the problem of computing over &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the entire web&lt;/em&gt;, such as… rebuilding a search index over &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the entire web&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Hard drives prices are now much lower than they were in 2003, the year the GFS paper was published.
&lt;p name=&quot;d448&quot; id=&quot;d448&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Perhaps you have read the GFS and MapReduce papers and appreciate that part of the problem for Google wasn’t capacity but throughput: they distributed storage because it was taking too long to stream bytes off disk. But what’s the throughput of the devices you’ll be using in 2017? Considering that you won’t need nearly as many of them as Google did, can you just buy better ones? What would it cost you to use SSDs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c157&quot; id=&quot;c157&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Maybe you expect to scale. But have you done the math? Are you likely to accumulate data faster than the rate at which SSD prices will go down? How much would your business need to grow before all your data would no longer fit on one machine? As of 2016, Stack Exchange served 200 million requests per day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;backed by just four SQL servers&lt;/a&gt;: a primary for Stack Overflow, a primary for everything else, and two replicas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca91&quot; id=&quot;ca91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Again, you may go through a process like UNPHAT and still decide to use Hadoop or Spark. The decision may even be the right one. What’s important is that you &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;actually use the right tool for the job&lt;/em&gt;. Google knows this well: once they decided that MapReduce wasn’t the right tool for building the index, they stopped using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1a8c&quot; id=&quot;1a8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, Understand the Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

<title>Adventures of putting 16 GB of RAM in a motherboard that doesn’t support it</title>
<link>https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2019/04/adventures-of-putting-16-gb-of-ram-in-a-motherboard-that-doesnt-support-it/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2019/04/adventures-of-putting-16-gb-of-ram-in-a-motherboard-that-doesnt-support-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I put 16 GB of RAM into one of my computers. The computer is using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxconnchannel.com/ProductDetail.aspx?T=motherboard&amp;amp;U=en-us0000474&quot;&gt;Foxconn P55MX&lt;/a&gt; motherboard with a Core i5 750. It’s old and could probably be replaced, but it still works for what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the interesting part. This motherboard doesn’t officially support 16 GB of RAM. The specs on the page I linked indicate that it supports a maximum of 8 GB. It only has 2 slots, so I had a suspicion that 8 GB sticks just weren’t as common back when this motherboard first came out. I decided to try anyway. In a lot of cases, motherboards do support more RAM than the manufacturer officially claims to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made sure the BIOS was completely updated (version 946F1P06) and put in my two 8 gig sticks. Then, I booted it up into my Ubuntu 16.04 install and everything worked perfectly. I decided that my theory about the motherboard actually supporting more RAM than the documentation claimed was correct and forgot about it. I enjoyed having all the extra RAM to work with and was happy that my gamble paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few months later, I tried to boot into Windows 10. I mostly use this computer in Linux. I only occasionally need to boot into Windows to check something out. That’s when the fun really started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-1210&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When GRUB came up, I navigated to the Windows 10 menu choice and hit enter. The Windows boot screen briefly showed up, and then I was immediately greeted with a Blue Screen of Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1211&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode.jpg 1286w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stop code was: ACPI_BIOS_ERROR. I did a bunch of Googling, and basically the gist of the error is that something is wrong with the ACPI tables in my BIOS. The ACPI tables tell your operating system how to set up the hardware among other things. Trying to boot from a Windows install USB stick resulted in the same error. So I guess Foxconn wasn’t lying. This computer doesn’t support 16 GB of RAM. Dropping the RAM back down to 8 GB resulted in a successful boot. RAM tests passed just fine too, so it wasn’t a matter of bad RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried contacting Foxconn support to ask about a potential BIOS fix, but didn’t receive a response. I found an email address on their website, and my message bounced. I don’t think Foxconn is in the motherboard business anymore. They don’t appear to provide support either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ordinary person would just give up at this point, and either stick with 8 gigs of RAM or get a new computer. I didn’t want to give up quite so easily. I knew that theoretically the computer could use 16 gigs, because it worked fine in Linux. So I started learning about ACPI and experimenting with my computer’s BIOS settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting section in the BIOS where I could play with some memory settings. One of the settings was “Memory Remap Feature”. I had it enabled. The documentation in the BIOS said that the option allows the “overlapped PCI memory” to be remapped above the total physical memory. Some Googling indicates you should turn it on when booting into a 64-bit OS. On a whim, I tried disabling it, and Windows actually booted! However, it told me that less than 4 GB of my RAM was usable. But this was nice — I had a way to get into Windows without having to physically remove RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu was the same. It limited me to less than 4 GB with the Memory Remap Feature disabled. At this point I was pretty sure there was some kind of memory mapping issue going on. I decided to look more into the ACPI_BIOS_ERROR code and what causes it. I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0xa5--acpi-bios-error&quot;&gt;this excellent Microsoft driver debugging document that explains the ACPI_BIOS_ERROR bug check&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for the document to help me, I clearly needed to find the four error parameters that used to be displayed with the blue screen on older versions of Windows. Windows 10 hides all the information by default, but I discovered that it’s possible to re-enable display of the extra error information by adding an entry to your registry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/a/1035736&quot;&gt;Here’s the excellent answer on Super User that pointed me in the correct direction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After applying the registry patch described in the linked answer, I re-enabled the Memory Remap Feature in my BIOS and booted Windows. The BSOD now showed four additional codes in the upper-left corner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-1024x661.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1212&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-768x496.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect! So Parameter 1 is 0x0000000000000002. Looking at the Microsoft documentation, Parameter 1 being equal to 0x02 means there is a problem processing the resource list for the PCI root buses. Because Parameters 2, 3, and 4 all look like crazy values, they are probably pointers. And when they’re all pointers, Microsoft says the problem is that the PCI decode region overlaps with the list of memory regions returned by the BIOS E820 interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. This information was a bit overwhelming, but it gave me something to start researching. I learned about how the E820 BIOS call provides information about memory regions. I went back to Linux and looked at all the kernel startup info using the dmesg command, paying extra special attention to E820 and ACPI stuff. Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009ebff] usable&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000000009ec00-0x000000000009ffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000e0000-0x00000000000fffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000cf77ffff] usable&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf780000-0x00000000cf78dfff] ACPI data&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf78e000-0x00000000cf7cffff] ACPI NVS&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf7d0000-0x00000000cf7dffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf7ed000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fee00000-0x00000000fee00fff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000ffb00000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000042fffffff] usable
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi PNP0A08:00: ignoring host bridge window [mem 0x400000000-0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;window] (conflicts with System RAM [mem 0x100000000-0x42fffffff])&lt;br /&gt;PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x0cf7 window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0d00-0xffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000bffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000d0000-0x000dffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xf0000000-0xfed8ffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00-ff]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! See that warning about the conflict? I hadn’t noticed it, but Linux had started printing that message at every boot after I installed the RAM. I tried booting into Linux with the Memory Remap Feature turned off in my BIOS. In that case, the last e820 region from 0x100000000 to 0x42fffffff was no longer present, and thus the conflict message also disappeared and the host bridge window from 0x400000000 to 0xfffffffff showed up as another “root bus resource” in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s my answer. The reason Linux works with 16 GB is because it notices the conflict and ignores the conflicting PCI range that ACPI provides, whereas Windows throws up its hands in disgust and pukes out a blue screen that says, “your BIOS has a problem!” I can’t blame Windows. There is definitely an overlap, so it makes sense that it gets confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I wasn’t sure if I should keep going. The last 768 MB chunk of my RAM from 0x400000000 to 0x42fffffff was mapped to the start of a huge area of the memory space that my motherboard uses for PCI stuff. Clearly if the motherboard is expecting PCI stuff to be there, something really bad could happen. So my motherboard only supports a total of 15.25 GB of RAM, and that’s that. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…Linux was working just fine without that extra PCI mapping area enabled! What if I could somehow modify the ACPI tables so that the big PCI range starts at 0x430000000 instead of 0x400000000? That would be just after the end of my RAM, so there would no longer be a conflict, and most of the PCI mapping window would still be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started digging into the ACPI tables. Luckily, Linux makes it really easy to dump them. There are tools out there, but you can also easily find the tables in sysfs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they all are. I was also excited because I discovered that GRUB has the ability to replace your ACPI tables with new versions. So if I could figure out which table was involved, I could install a new version of that table using GRUB and theoretically Windows would be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/iasl&quot;&gt;iasl&lt;/a&gt;, among other tools, to try to disassemble the different ACPI tables and find the 0x400000000 value so I could change it. Remembering that the value is probably little-endian, and it’s also probably 64 bits wide, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk&quot;&gt;binwalk&lt;/a&gt; to search through all the table files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
binwalk -R '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00' *
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one result in the OEMB table. The next 64-bit word after it was 0x1000000000, which just so happens to be one more than the end address in the host bridge window conflict message. This looked like a very promising lead. The OEMB table is special because it doesn’t appear to be a standard table according to the ACPI specifications. Linux also complains that its checksum is invalid, but I don’t think it matters. I’m assuming you can guess what I did next…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a copy of the OEMB table, replacing the 0x00 byte directly before the 0x04 byte with 0x30 in order to change the value to 0x430000000 (remember, it’s little-endian). I put this modified copy in a file called /boot/oemb.dat in Linux. Then, I used GRUB to replace the OEMB table with my copy by temporarily inserting the following command into the boot command list (by typing the letter ‘e’ in GRUB with Ubuntu selected):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi --exclude=OEMB /boot/oemb.dat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that it tells GRUB to load all ACPI tables except the OEMB table, and then tells it to load the content of /boot/oemb.dat and add it as an additional table. This will effectively replace the old OEMB table with my new OEMB table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I booted up Linux…and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi PNP0A08:00: ignoring host bridge window [mem 0x400000000-0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;window] (conflicts with System RAM [mem 0x100000000-0x42fffffff])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That damned error was still there. WTF? I guessed that maybe the PCI range was actually determined somewhere else, but I didn’t see anywhere else that particular value was defined. I verified that my patched OEMB table was indeed loaded, and went back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided to use iasl to decompile the DSDT table. Some sleuthing indicated that the DSDT table was going to contain a method called “_CRS” that is responsible for creating this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
iasl -d DSDT
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the _CRS method associated with the PCI bus in the resulting .dsl file, and it looked pretty complicated. The DSDT table contains actual code, so it’s not necessarily possible to simply search for table values. In my case, the _CRS method was fairly complex. I interpreted the code as best as I could. It led me to realize that the _CRS method was loading information from a different table in memory, starting at 0xCF78E064. I looked at my Linux dmesg boot log again, and found this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
ACPI: Early table checksum verification disabled&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: RSDP 0x00000000000F9820 000014 (v00 ACPIAM)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: RSDT 0x00000000CF780000 000044 (v01 012110 RSDT0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: FACP 0x00000000CF780200 000084 (v01 012110 FACP0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: DSDT 0x00000000CF780460 006FE7 (v01 946F1  946F1P06 00000000 INTL 20051117)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: FACS 0x00000000CF78E000 000040&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: APIC 0x00000000CF780390 00008C (v01 012110 APIC0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: MCFG 0x00000000CF780420 00003C (v01 012110 OEMMCFG  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: OEMB 0x00000000CF78E040 000082 (v01 012110 OEMB0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: HPET 0x00000000CF78A460 000038 (v01 012110 OEMHPET  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: GSCI 0x00000000CF78E0D0 002024 (v01 012110 GMCHSCI  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: DMAR 0x00000000CF790100 000090 (v01 AMI    OEMDMAR  00000001 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: SSDT 0x00000000CF7917C0 000363 (v01 DpgPmm CpuPm    00000012 INTL 20051117)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! It’s loading the information from the OEMB table. My hunch had been correct all along. So why didn’t replacing the OEMB table work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked again at my dmesg log after replacing the OEMB table. What I hadn’t realized was that GRUB relocates most of the tables, including OEMB, to a different area in memory if you try to modify them. The problem is that the DSDT table is hardcoded to look at 0xCF78E064 for things it needs to read out of the OEMB table. It assumes that’s where the OEMB table is loaded. So it wasn’t looking at my new modified table — it was still looking at the original table. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first inclination was to modify the DSDT to look at the new OEMB table location, but I felt like that was a bad idea for the future because new versions of GRUB might change the location of where the custom OEMB table is stored in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on a different idea. GRUB has commands called write_byte, write_word, write_dword, and the read_ equivalents of them all. What if I used GRUB to modify the original OEMB table in place? BIOSes these days are compressed. The tables are probably loaded into RAM, so theoretically I should be able to modify the table values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did. I added the following command to my GRUB boot sequence as a temporary test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
write_byte 0xCF78E0B5 0x30
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This replaced the 0x00 byte just before the 0x04 byte with 0x30, transforming the 64-bit PCI start address of that final range into 0x0000000430000000. I didn’t bother updating the OEMB table’s checksum, because Linux was already whining to me that the checksum was incorrect, so it obviously didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted into Linux, and anxiously checked my dmesg log for the PCI stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x0cf7 window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0d00-0xffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000bffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000d0000-0x000dffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xf0000000-0xfed8ffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x430000000-0xfffffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00-ff]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! The 0x430000000-0xfffffffff window appeared as a new valid window in the list, and the conflict warning was gone. After verifying that Linux still worked fine, I tried booting into Windows with the same hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! I am now able to boot into Windows with 16 GB of RAM installed in my computer, as long as I use GRUB as my bootloader with the write_byte command above. The stock Windows 10 bootloader obviously won’t work, and if I ever reinstall Windows I’ll probably have to temporarily yank out half of my RAM so that the installer will boot. But it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To permanently add the fix to GRUB, I created a file called /etc/grub.d/00_patchbios containing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
# This file patches the BIOS in my Foxconn P55MX motherboard to work&lt;br /&gt;# properly when I have 16 GB of RAM installed. It's a nasty hack.&lt;br /&gt;# Basically, the BIOS is hardcoded in the OEMB ACPI table&lt;br /&gt;# to have a PCI address range from 0x400000000 to 0xfffffffff, but&lt;br /&gt;# that overlaps with 16 GB of RAM being installed, because the RAM&lt;br /&gt;# uses up (among other ranges) 0x100000000 to 0x42fffffff.&lt;br /&gt;# This patch changes the table to actually list a PCI range of:&lt;br /&gt;# 0x430000000 to 0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;echo &quot;write_byte 0xCF78E0B5 0x30&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I made sure to chmod +x it, and ran sudo update-grub. Now the patch is automatically applied when GRUB starts up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know how safe this is. I don’t know if the motherboard is actually hardwired to look at those addresses for PCI stuff or what. All I know is it passes my RAM tests. Since Linux has been working fine with the 16 gigs of RAM installed, I am not too worried. It’s possible I would have problems if I had more PCI/PCIe cards installed or something, but in my use case, it seems to behave fine. Obviously, your mileage may vary, and this hack isn’t going to directly work on other motherboards because every BIOS’s ACPI table is going to be a little bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a fun learning experience to share with the world! I hope you learned something from reading this post. I sure learned a lot just from the process of figuring this all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congestion pricing has the potential to significantly change how traffic flows through Manhattan streets, how commuters get around the city, how companies like Uber and Lyft operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But most radically, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/nyregion/new-york-congestion-pricing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;if the policy spreads&lt;/a&gt; it could challenge a deeply embedded cultural idea, requiring people to pay for something Americans have long demanded — and largely believe they’ve gotten — free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The idea of the open road evokes these intertwined meanings: The freedom to use it should be free. Residential street parking should be free. Traffic lanes should be free. Stretches of public curb dedicated to private driveways? Those should be free, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In other ways, the government has heavily subsidized driving, or hidden the reality of who pays for it in places no one sees. Local laws require off-street parking from businesses and housing developers, who pass on the construction cost of it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/research_item/who-pays-for-parking/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to tenants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/business/economy/15view.html?_r=3&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/a&gt; who may not drive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Federal and state governments fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee (and that have come to operate like less and less of one &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-15/gas-taxes-aren-t-paying-the-bills-for-roads-anymore&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in an era of fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They add up to a pretty giant system of subsidies,” said Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But they don’t look like what we often consider subsidies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This system looks to us, instead, like an entitlement — driving is an American right, and so the infrastructure that enables it should be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congestion pricing is premised instead on the notion that public roads are a valuable and scarce resource. And we should pay in some places to use it not primarily to gin up revenue, but to help manage access for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s a huge departure from how we’ve culturally thought about this over the years,” said Kari Watkins, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In reality, the government is a monopoly provider of road space, and the government has largely chosen to give it away. It’s no surprise, then, that the vast majority of American commuters &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/10/03/americans-commuting-choices-5-major-takeaways-from-2016-census-data/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drive to work alone&lt;/a&gt;, or that all those lonely commuters (plus taxis, Ubers, buses and delivery trucks) cause congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the government holds down the price of something people value, Mr. Manville said, we get shortages. And congestion is effectively a shortage of road — one that occurs at the peak times when people want to use it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If we had that problem with other kinds of infrastructure or commodities, we’d charge people more for them. If airline tickets were particularly in demand, their prices would go up. If there were a run on avocados, grocers wouldn’t respond by keeping them as cheap as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The roads hold such a special position in our brain that we use logic around them that we would never use around everything else,” Mr. Manville said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other countries have socialized health care, parental leave or housing, Jeffrey Tumlin, a transportation consultant at Nelson\Nygaard, pointed out. In America, we’ve socialized driving — and housing for our cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t let people put their self-storage containers in public parks, but it’s just fine to store their cars on other public land for free,” Mr. Tumlin wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Peter Norton, a historian at the University of Virginia, traces this thinking to the 1920s and ’30s, when industry groups and government officials were debating whether to fund America’s expanding roads with tolls, which were by then common on bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Road builders were happy to have tolls, and they appeared in places like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But auto clubs and car manufacturers dependent on car sales opposed them. They preferred a gas tax, a cost less visible to drivers every time they got in a car. Together, they were remarkably savvy about branding the choice as one between “toll roads and free roads.” (A 1939 federal report even &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.virginiaplaces.org/transportation/tollroadsfreeroads.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adopted that phrase as its title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Of course, there’s no such thing as a free road,” Mr. Norton said. “But they were making the ambiguous association between their cause and the great cause of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gsapp/projs/call-it-home/html/chapter10.2.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industry publications&lt;/a&gt; at the time linked the need for “free” roads to patriotism, the Bill of Rights, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gsapp/projs/call-it-home/html/images/2-015.gif&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even the Minutemen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today, because most people seldom pay directly for roads — or because general funds do — it can seem as if no one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Therefore the street transportation system has no cost,” said Yonah Freemark, a doctoral student in city planning at M.I.T., who runs the blog &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Transport Politic&lt;/a&gt;. “And therefore we can just expect to have unlimited parking, we can expect to have unlimited access to neighborhoods, for whatever reason, for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Take those expectations to their logical conclusion in a major city today, and you get 10-mile-per-hour road speeds, rampant double parking, clogged intersections and worsening commute times. You get, finally, the political will for congestion pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now the culture of limitless, cheap driving may begin to shift in some places. But it will take much longer to change the physical environment that has grown up around that culture over decades, leaving many people without good alternatives to driving alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Where there are few other choices, like reliable bus routes, congestion pricing risks burdening poorer drivers in particular. But that is a problem we’ve thought about before, too, Mr. Manville said, if we’re now willing to treat roads as we do other infrastructure. He pointed to “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/doas/home/lifelinedetail.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lifeline&lt;/a&gt;” utility services: subsidized rates for electricity and gas offered to users with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Fortunately, congestion pricing comes with its own built-in solution,” he said, “which is that it raises a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Agile Lite: Agile without all the burnout</title>
<link>https://github.com/davebs/AgileLite</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/davebs/AgileLite</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Agile software development&quot; is a great idea that's been overcomplicated by the publishing and consulting industries. Agile Lite is an attempt to simplify the situation. You do not need a book or a workshop to explain Agile Lite. You just need a text file with several paragraphs. This is that text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Lite is pretty simple. It can be applied to any project with people working on it, assuming that the work can be broken into smaller component tasks that we'll just call Issues. Like other agile methodologies, it utilizes short development cycles called Sprints. Somewhat uniquely, Agile Lite explicitly acknowledges the prevalence of burnout in the software development industry and attempts to mitigate it directly via a 3 weeks on/1 week off development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic setup is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week of each month is spent with project leads and stakeholders defining the upcoming &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt;. Despite a week being allocated, a sprint planning session should take no more than 2 hours and probably about 45 minutes if done correctly. It is an intentionally light week and many people may simply take the time off to paint or surf or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt; takes place during the remaining 3 weeks of the month. During this period, engineers will work on the Issues that were allocated to them during the sprint planning sessions. Because the team may be fully remote and distributed over time-zones, &quot;live&quot; meetings happen infrequently and most communication happens through the &lt;code&gt;issue tracking system&lt;/code&gt; (which is faster to work with than e-mail). A shared kanban board like Trello is a sufficient issue tracking system, but a spreadsheet is probably not. Daily standups are discouraged; a basic pulse on the project can be obtained by reviewing issue tracking system updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt; has begun, Issues may not be added to the sprint, but they can be removed. This reduces context switching and that is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues that are not completed during the sprint are reviewed at the next sprint planning session and it's decided whether to move the Issue forward into the next sprint, put it back in the Backlog, or reassign it to a different developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue is either in the &lt;code&gt;backlog&lt;/code&gt; or in the &lt;code&gt;current sprint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, developers are encouraged to take the planning week off to allow their brain to recover from the previous sprint. There are no death marches. Developers don't work on the weekends. This all helps avoid burnout. Avoiding burnout is good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it. The system doesn't really prescribe engineering practices and I think that's ok. Engineering practices can be defined at a per project level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support work is done on a rotating basis because sometimes things do happen unexpectedly and need to be dealt with, but a surprising number of issues can wait until later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Lite is a better, more sustainable way to develop software. It empowers software developers while delivering a consistently solid level of productivity to project stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MIT cuts ties with Chinese tech firms Huawei, ZTE</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-zte/elite-u-s-school-mit-cuts-ties-with-chinese-tech-firms-huawei-zte-idUSKCN1RG0FS</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-zte/elite-u-s-school-mit-cuts-ties-with-chinese-tech-firms-huawei-zte-idUSKCN1RG0FS</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has severed ties with Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp as U.S. authorities investigate the Chinese firms for alleged sanctions violations, the school said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT is the latest top educational institution to unplug telecom equipment made by Huawei and other Chinese companies to avoid losing federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;MIT is not accepting new engagements or renewing existing ones with Huawei and ZTE or their respective subsidiaries due to federal investigations regarding violations of sanction restrictions,&quot; Maria Zuber, its vice president for research, said &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2K528XI&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2K528XI&lt;/a&gt; in a letter on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborations with China, Russia and Saudi Arabia would face additional administrative review procedures, Zuber added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The institute will revisit collaborations with these entities as circumstances dictate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain’s Oxford University stopped accepting funding from Huawei this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re disappointed by MIT’s decision, but we understand the pressure they’re under at the moment,” Huawei said on Thursday. The company denies the allegations of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We trust the U.S. judicial system will ultimately reach the right conclusion,” Huawei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Zuber and Richard Lester, an associate provost at MIT who also signed the letter, referred questions about details such as how much research was likely to be affected to MIT spokespeople, who did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to MIT faculty at the start of the current school year, Lester wrote that in cases where U.S. and Chinese interests are in direct conflict, MIT would prioritize its home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She denies wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions forced ZTE to stop most business between April and July last year after Commerce Department officials said it broke a pact and was caught illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea. The sanctions were lifted after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry referred questions to the two companies, but said Chinese firms were required to abide by local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we ask that governments in countries where they are based provide a just, fair, and nondiscriminatory environment,” its spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a news briefing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese telecoms equipment makers have also been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries Beijing could use their equipment for spying. The companies, however, have said the concerns are unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Heart of a Swimmer vs. the Heart of a Runner</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/well/move/heart-health-swimming-running-exercise.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/well/move/heart-health-swimming-running-exercise.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Do world-class swimmers’ hearts function differently than the hearts of elite runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A new study finds that the answer may be yes, and the differences, although slight, could be telling and consequential, even for those of us who swim or run at a much less lofty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Cardiologists and exercise scientists already know that regular exercise changes the look and workings of the human heart. The left ventricle, in particular, alters with exercise. This chamber of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the rest of the body, using a rather strenuous twisting and unspooling motion, as if the ventricle were a sponge being wrung out before springing back into shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, requires that considerable oxygen be delivered to working muscles, placing high demands on the left ventricle. In response, this part of the heart in athletes typically becomes larger and stronger than in sedentary people and functions more efficiently, filling with blood a little earlier and more fully and untwisting with each heartbeat a bit more rapidly, allowing the heart to pump more blood more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While almost any exercise can prompt remodeling of the left ventricle over time, different types of exercise often produce subtly different effects. A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361851&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 study found, for instance&lt;/a&gt;, that competitive rowers, whose sport combines endurance and power, had greater muscle mass in their left ventricles than runners, making their hearts strong but potentially less nimble during the twisting that pumps blood to muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These past studies compared the cardiac effects of land-based activities, though, with an emphasis on running. Few have examined swimming, even though it is not only a popular exercise but unique. Swimmers, unlike runners, lie prone, in buoyant water and hold their breaths, all of which could affect cardiac demands and how the heart responds and remakes itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So, for the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.01700/full&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study, which was published in November in Frontiers in Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada and other institutions set out to map the structure and function of elite swimmers’ and runners’ hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The researchers focused on world-class performers because those athletes would have been running or swimming strenuously for years, presumably exaggerating any differential effects of their training, the researchers reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eventually they recruited 16 national-team runners and another 16 comparable swimmers, male and female, some of them sprinters and others distance specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They asked the athletes to visit the exercise lab after not exercising for 12 hours and then, when on site, to lie quietly. They checked heart rates and blood pressures and finally examined the athletes’ hearts with echocardiograms, which show both the structure and functioning of the organ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It turned out, to no one’s surprise, that the athletes, whether runners or swimmers, enjoyed enviable heart health. Their heart rates hovered around 50 beats per minute, with the runners’ rates slightly lower than the swimmers’. But all of the athletes’ heart rates were much lower than is typical for sedentary people, signifying that their hearts were robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The athletes also had relatively large, efficient left ventricles, their echocardiograms showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But there were interesting if small differences between the swimmers and runners, the researchers found. While all of the athletes’ left ventricles filled with blood earlier than average and untwisted more quickly during each heartbeat, those desirable changes were amplified in the runners. Their ventricles filled even earlier and untwisted more emphatically than the swimmers’ hearts did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In theory, those differences should allow blood to move from and back to the runners’ hearts more rapidly than would happen inside the swimmers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But these differences do not necessarily show that the runners’ hearts worked better than the swimmers’, says Jamie Burr, a professor at the University of Guelph and director of its human performance lab, who conducted the new study with the lead author, Katharine Currie, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since swimmers exercise in a horizontal position, he says, their hearts do not have to fight gravity to get blood back to the heart, unlike in upright runners. Posture does some of the work for swimmers, and so their hearts reshape themselves only as much as needed for the demands of their sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The findings underscore how exquisitely sensitive our bodies are to different types of exercise, Dr. Burr says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They also might provide a reason for swimmers sometimes to consider logging miles on the road, he says, to intensify the remodeling of their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Of course, the athletes here were tested while resting, not competing, he says, and it is not clear whether any variations in their ventricles would be meaningful during races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The study also was cross-sectional, meaning it looked at the athletes only once. They might have been born with unusual cardiac structures that somehow allowed them to excel at their sports, instead of the sports changing their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Burr, however, doubts that. Exercise almost certainly remakes our hearts, he says, and he hopes future experiments can tell us more about how each activity affects us and which might be best for different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But even now, he says, “an important message is that all of the athletes showed better function than a normal person off the street, which supports the message that exercise is good for hearts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Linus Torvalds Says Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram Are &amp;#039;A Disease&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/linus-torvalds-says-twitter-facebook-instagram-a-disease-2019-4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/linus-torvalds-says-twitter-facebook-instagram-a-disease-2019-4</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system that secretly runs the internet and is the basis for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/category/android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, was recently asked what he would change about the tech world that his technology helped create, if he could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;His answer: social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;I absolutely detest modern 'social media' — Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It's a disease. It seems to encourage bad behavior,&quot; Torvalds &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds&quot;&gt;told the Linux Journal's Robert Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is interesting criticism from a man who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/geekess-calls-linus-torvalds-out-for-rants-2013-7&quot;&gt;has often been accused of being uncivil&lt;/a&gt; to other programmers on Linux email lists. Torvalds is known as a brilliant, funny, and speaks-his-mind kind of guy who is generally fair-minded but doesn't tolerate fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/11-enterprise-rock-stars-quietly-changing-the-industry-2019-3&quot;&gt;11 enterprise rock stars that have quietly been responsible for some of the most successful cloud services in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;That personality means he's publicly dressed down people whose work, or motivations, fell short of his standards. Years ago, he defended his behavior when a developer from the chipmaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/category/intel&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; publicly called him out for it and told him to knock it off because it was not only unprofessional but was also driving away newbies and others who wanted to contribute to Linux. He shrugged off the criticism &lt;a href=&quot;http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;amp;m=137392506516022&amp;amp;w=2&quot;&gt;by responding&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;People are different. I'm not polite, and I get upset easily but generally don't hold a grudge — I have these explosive emails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since then, the open-source world has started to confront how much bad behavior goes on its world with various communities and has adopted codes of conduct. In 2018, the main Linux community adopted a code of conduct, too. And along with that, Torvalds finally said his behavior needed changing. He took time off to &quot;get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and respond appropriately,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So Torvalds calling out social media for encouraging bad behavior is ironic. To be fair, as one of the most famous programmers, he's been the target of his fair share of online abuse, too. In 2015, he made a cheesy, funny video in which he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/linux-creator-linus-torvalds-tweets-2014-5&quot;&gt;read aloud nasty tweets about himself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;'If you cannot prove your identity, your crazy rant on some social-media platform shouldn't be visible'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Torvalds told Linux Journal that the internet eliminates all the social cues that are usually part of communications, so &quot;nobody can hear you being subtle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;It's easy to miss humor and sarcasm, but it's also very easy to overlook the reaction of the recipient, so you get things like flame wars, etc., that might not happen as easily with face-to-face interaction,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Torvalds said the same issues can crop up with email, too, but he believes email is more necessary and often communicating real information, which is not always so with social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;The whole 'liking' and 'sharing' model is just garbage. There is no effort and no quality control. In fact, it's all geared to the reverse of quality control, with lowest common denominator targets, and click-bait, and things designed to generate an emotional response, often one of moral outrage,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On top of all that, when you add in anonymity, &quot;it's just disgusting,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Some people confuse privacy and anonymity and think they go hand in hand, and that protecting privacy means that you need to protect anonymity. I think that's wrong. Anonymity is important if you're a whistle-blower, but if you cannot prove your identity, your crazy rant on some social-media platform shouldn't be visible, and you shouldn't be able to share it or like it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consequently, Torvalds is not on any social media today, although he briefly used Google Plus for a while, feeling like Google's unsuccessful attempt at social media was &quot;less mindless&quot; than the others. (Google announced it was shutting down Google Plus in December &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/google-plus-executive-profiles-deleted-2019-4&quot;&gt;and began deleting accounts on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Torvalds didn't get into whether or not governments should step in and start regulating internet companies, perhaps making them more responsible for the content they promote (if not host). Still, having Torvalds give the social-media world a &quot;thumbs down&quot; isn't a good sign for internet companies trying to convince the world that they are the good guys.&lt;/p&gt;
