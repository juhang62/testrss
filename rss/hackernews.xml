<title>Rails 6.1</title>
<link>https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/12/9/Rails-6-1-0-release/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/12/9/Rails-6-1-0-release/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rails 6.1 has been released and wow does it have a lot of great stuff! We’ve been hard at work these past few months implementing improvements to multiple databases, adding support for destroying associations in jobs instead of in-memory, turning errors into objects, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how Rails has grown over the years and while we have some improvements to make to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/5/7/A-May-of-WTFs/&quot;&gt;onboarding process&lt;/a&gt;, Rails has never been better. The features in this release focus on adding the functionality you need to keep your application up and running for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the new functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multi-db-improvements&quot;&gt;Multi-DB Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;per-database-connection-switching&quot;&gt;Per-database Connection Switching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails 6.1 provides you with the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40370&quot;&gt;switch connections per-database&lt;/a&gt;. In 6.0 if you switched to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/code&gt; role then all database connections also switched to the reading role. Now in 6.1 if you set &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;legacy_connection_handling&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in your configuration, Rails will allow you to switch connections for a single database by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;connected_to&lt;/code&gt; on the corresponding abstract class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;horizontal-sharding&quot;&gt;Horizontal Sharding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails 6.0 provided the ability to functionally partition (multiple partitions, different schemas) your database but wasn’t able to support horizontal sharding (same schema, multiple partitions). Rails wasn’t able to support horizontal sharding because models in Active Record could only have one connection per-role per-class. This is now fixed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38531&quot;&gt;horizontal sharding&lt;/a&gt; with Rails is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-improvements&quot;&gt;Additional Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding horizontal sharding support we added tons of new functionality and improved a lot of internals for multiple databases. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kylekthompson&quot;&gt;Kyle Thompson&lt;/a&gt; added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38449&quot;&gt;database namespaced tasks&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db:schema:dump:namespace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db:schema:load:namespace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db:structure:dump:namespace&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db:structure:load:namespace&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/casperisfine&quot;&gt;Jean Boussier&lt;/a&gt; from Shopify improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37296&quot;&gt;connection pool management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;strict-loading-associations&quot;&gt;Strict Loading Associations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the many database and connection management improvements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove&quot;&gt;Aaron Patterson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eileencodes&quot;&gt;Eileen M. Uchitelle&lt;/a&gt; added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37400&quot;&gt;strict loading associations&lt;/a&gt;. With this feature you can ensure that all your associations are loaded eagerly and stop N+1’s before they happen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kddeisz&quot;&gt;Kevin Deisz&lt;/a&gt; added additional support to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38541&quot;&gt;association declarations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bogdanvlviv&quot;&gt;bogdanvlviv&lt;/a&gt; added support to turn &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39491&quot;&gt;strict loading on by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delegated-types&quot;&gt;Delegated Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails 6.1 adds “Delegated Types” as an alternative to single-table inheritance. This is helpful for representing class hierarchies allowing the superclass to be a concrete class that is represented by its own table. Each subclass has its own table for additional attributes. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39341&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dhh&quot;&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;destroy-associations-async&quot;&gt;Destroy Associations Async&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destroy associations async adds the ability for applications to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt; associations in a background job. This can help you avoid timeouts and other performance issues in your application when destroying data. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40157&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; was a group effort - the PR was started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/georgeclaghorn&quot;&gt;George Claghorn&lt;/a&gt; from Basecamp, further support added by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gwincr11&quot;&gt;Cory Gwin&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub and finalized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rafaelfranca&quot;&gt;Rafael França&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adrianna-chang-shopify&quot;&gt;Adrianna Chang&lt;/a&gt; from Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;error-objects&quot;&gt;Error Objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Model’s errors are now objects with an interface that allows your application to more easily handle and interact with errors thrown by models. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/32313&quot;&gt;The feature&lt;/a&gt; was implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lulalala&quot;&gt;lulalala&lt;/a&gt; and includes a query interface, enables more precise testing, and access to error details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;active-storage-improvements&quot;&gt;Active Storage Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Storage got a nice update in Rails 6.1! You can now configure attachments for service you want to store them in. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34935&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; was implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev&quot;&gt;Dmitry Tsepelev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Rails 6.1 adds support to Active Storage for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36729&quot;&gt;permanent URLs for blobs&lt;/a&gt;. Implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peterzhu2118&quot;&gt;Peter Zhu&lt;/a&gt; from Shopify, this feature allows configuring your attachments to use a private or public URL and ensures that public URLs will always use a permanent URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disallowed-deprecation-support&quot;&gt;Disallowed Deprecation Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like to run your application deprecation-warning free then this feature is for you. The feature allows applications to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37940&quot;&gt;optionally raise an error&lt;/a&gt; if a deprecation warning is thrown. This is useful for making sure developers don’t reintroduce deprecation warnings that have already been fixed. The feature was implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cpruitt&quot;&gt;Cliff Pruitt&lt;/a&gt; of Test Double!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-improvements-and-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A release isn’t just about the awesome features you get. It’s also about fixing bugs, improving performance, and making Rails more stable for everyone. This release includes an improvement that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37266&quot;&gt;avoids making a query if &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; passes an empty array&lt;/a&gt; reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mstruve&quot;&gt;Molly Struve&lt;/a&gt; and the fix implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhawthorn&quot;&gt;John Hawthorn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eileencodes&quot;&gt;Eileen M. Uchitelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tenderlove&quot;&gt;Aaron Patterson&lt;/a&gt; also implemented a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/39009&quot;&gt;performance improvement&lt;/a&gt; that speeds up &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; queries when we know all the values are an integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-classic-autoloader-is-deprecated&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/code&gt; Autoloader is Deprecated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/code&gt; autoloader has served us well since the first Rails release, but there’s a new kid on the block and it is going to start its deprecation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Rails projects are strongly discouraged from using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/code&gt; autoloader, and we recommend that existing projects running on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/code&gt; switch to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zeitwerk&lt;/code&gt; mode when upgrading. Please check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upgrading Ruby on Rails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guide for tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-more&quot;&gt;And more!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many great changes in Rails 6.1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/releases/6-1-0/contributors&quot;&gt;654&lt;/a&gt; people made contributions to Rails. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v6.1.0&quot;&gt;CHANGELOGS&lt;/a&gt; for more details on bug fixes, performance improvements, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who reported a bug, sent a pull request, and helped improve Rails. Rails is better because of your hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor will acquire Boston Dynamics. The acquisition will be finalized at Hyundai’s December 10 board meeting. News about the deal was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202012080011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the deal is for $921 million (1 trillion won). &lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt; has also confirmed the news with a source familiar with the deal. The source said the acquisition is for about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Boston Dynamics but has yet to hear back. We will provide updates as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics has become a bigger focus for Hyundai since Chung Euisun was named chairman in October. The company has since said robotics will account for 20% of its future business. Hyundai Robotics was founded in 2017, but it officially launched earlier in 2020. The company’s automotive group invested in autonomous vehicle startup 42dot and Realtime Robotics in 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/aptiv-hyundai-joint-venture-autonomous-vehicles/&quot;&gt;Hyundai has also created a $4 billion autonomous vehicle joint venture with Aptiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear how Boston Dynamics will fit into Hyundai, which becomes the third owner of Boston Dynamics in seven years. It was acquired by Google in 2013 and sold to Softbank Group in 2017. The RBR50 company has mainly operated as an R&amp;amp;D organization since it was founded. But a new emphasis on commercialization was evident after it was acquired by Softbank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;We Took Boston Dynamics' Spot Robot for a Walk from 3,000 Miles Away&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKMeMb9CF8E?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/boston-dynamics-3d-vision-kinema-systems/&quot;&gt;Boston Dynamics acquired Kinema Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a Menlo Park, Calif.-based startup that uses vision sensors and deep learning to help robots manipulate boxes. Kinema’s Pick system was rebranded as the Boston Dynamics Pick System. It was the company’s first commercialized product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, it&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/spot-commercial-availability-a-milestone-for-quadrupeds/&quot;&gt; commercialized its Spot quadruped robot&lt;/a&gt;, initially selling it to U.S.-based customers for $74,500. Sales have since been opened to other parts of the world, and Spot has been used for a number of interesting applications, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/watch-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-explore-chernobyl/&quot;&gt;radiation monitoring at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;. It has reportedly already sold 400-plus robots and generated $30 million-plus in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early November, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/softbank-is-in-talks-to-sell-robot-maker-boston-dynamics-to-hyundai-1.1519810&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bloomberg first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Hyundai was in talks to acquire Boston Dynamics from Tokyo-based SoftBank Group. The Japanese conglomerate is selling off non-core business assets after it was hit hard by a series of soured bets, including WeWork and Uber. In September 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/nvidia-acquire-processor-maker-arm-softbank-40b/&quot;&gt;Softbank sold Arm to NVIDIA for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softbank Group has also been going through leadership changes. Sources have told &lt;em&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/em&gt; several champions of the Boston Dynamics acquisition are no longer at Softbank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftBank Group is also a holding company for SoftBank Robotics, which produces the Pepper humanoid (formerly from Aldebaran Robotics) and the Whiz commercial floor-cleaning robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Perry, vice president of business development at Boston Dynamics, recently joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-robot-report-podcast/id1517684926&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robot Report Podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the commercial launch of Spot and its most unique applications. You can listen to that conversation below.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MDMA-assisted couples therapy investigated in pilot trial</title>
<link>https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/mdma-assisted-couples-therapy-ptsd-cbct-pilot-trial-maps/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/mdma-assisted-couples-therapy-ptsd-cbct-pilot-trial-maps/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s and early 1980s MDMA was often utilized to help facilitate positive results in couples counseling. A &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2050324518767442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few dozen pioneering psychotherapists&lt;/a&gt; in the United States explored the drug’s therapeutic uses until the US government declared MDMA a Schedule 1 controlled substance in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Ingrasci, a psychiatrist who had for years been successfully using MDMA as an adjunct to marriage counseling, was one of several therapists who opposed the scheduling of the drug. Ingrasci, whose work became foundational for many modern psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy researchers, provided prominent testimony during the government's scheduling hearings in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have seen MDMA help many couples break through longstanding communication blocks because of the safety that emerges in the session as a result of the drug,” Ingrasci &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.org/research-archive/dea-mdma/pdf/0011.PDF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;declared in his testimony&lt;/a&gt; from the scheduling hearings. “It is difficult to convey in words how deeply moving it is to watch couples heal in this way with the help of MDMA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all know what happened next. MDMA was classified a Schedule 1 drug with no medical uses making it virtually impossible to clinically study anywhere in the world. Since the turn of century research into the therapeutic uses of MDMA has slowly but surely moved back into the realm of clinical credibility, largely due to the efforts of &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://newatlas.com/mdma-ptsd-rick-doblin/52792/&quot;&gt;Rick Doblin and his non-profit organization MAPS&lt;/a&gt; (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAPS was founded in 1986, in the wake of MDMA’s Schedule 1 restriction. Its goal was to get MDMA clinical research going again, and over the years its primary framework to do that was through investigating the drug as an adjunct to psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://newatlas.com/mdma-ptsd-rick-doblin/52792/&quot;&gt;years of work&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://newatlas.com/mdma-ptsd-successful-trial-results/57074/&quot;&gt;truly extraordinary results&lt;/a&gt;, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD is now on the &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/mdma-psychotherapy-ptsd-expanded-access-fda-maps/&quot;&gt;cusp of being approved&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. And now some researchers are turning their attention to engaging in clinical studies investigating the benefits of the drug in couples therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest study, published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Psychotraumatology&lt;/em&gt;, is the first to explore the effects of MDMA therapy in couples where one member is suffering from PTSD. Candice Monson, corresponding author on the new study, says this new proof-of-concept trial arose organically out of the prior MDMA for PTSD research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PTSD in one partner can cause distress in the relationship and barriers to understanding each other,” says Monson. “It seems that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can engender empathy and connection, opening a pathway to remembering why came together in the first place and a desire to understand the other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preliminary study investigated the feasibility of incorporating two MDMA sessions into a previously established PTSD therapeutic regime known as CBCT, or cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy. As opposed to traditional PTSD therapies focusing on the individual, CBCT is designed to help improve relationship functioning for couples, while still improving PTSD symptoms in the individual patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new trial recruited six couples, in which one member of the couple had a pre-existing PTSD diagnosis, and explored the feasibility of incorporating two MDMA sessions into the CBCT protocol, which traditionally involves around 15 therapy sessions conducted over several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The literature that inspired this study suggests that MDMA may allow people to talk about painful experiences without experiencing the pain again,” explains Monson. “The therapist can guide couples to talk about very difficult things that they’ve either experienced themselves or experienced together—against the other or with the other— with a greater sense of understanding, openness, connection, and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study reports the addition of MDMA to the couples therapy protocol resulted in effects that were, “on par with, or greater than, those achieved with CBCT alone.” Improvements were detected in both relationship outcomes and individual PTSD symptoms. The effects were most significant at the six-month follow up implying the MDMA therapy confers compelling long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note the study was uncontrolled, so any efficacy comparisons to CBCT alone can only be garnered by examining prior CBCT studies. However, this feasibility study does establish the addition of MDMA to the pre-existing therapeutic protocol is safe and it does not negatively interfere with other PTSD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previously published case study in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.2019.1589028&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of Psychoactive Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; outlined the experiences of one couple in this preliminary trial. The couple, Stuart and Josie, were suffering from relationship difficulties after Stuart’s trauma-related PTSD symptoms had returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For Josie, the CBCT + MDMA experience allowed her the opportunity to no longer feel she had to 'walk on eggshells,' and to experience relief from anxiety and tension,” the case study reports. “Together, Stuart and Josie were able to share the experience of Stuart’s traumatic memories, and face them in a united and accepting manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the improvements seen in PTSD symptoms in this pilot study were noted as greater than those seen in several individually delivered MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD trials. Of course, this is a tiny pilot study, so little can be concluded by comparing its efficacy results to these larger ongoing randomized trials. However, the interpersonal nature of PTSD and the way the condition impacts close relationships does suggest involving partners in a therapeutic protocol could hypothetically improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger Phase 2 randomized controlled trial is currently being prepared by the research team. The next steps will be to better explore the safety and efficacy of MDMA-facilitated CBCT for PTSD in a diverse set of participants with a variety of relationship distresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20008198.2020.1840123&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;European Journal of Psychotraumatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FTC Sues Facebook for Illegal Monopolization</title>
<link>https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1910134fbcomplaint.pdf&quot;&gt;sued Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct. Following a lengthy investigation in cooperation with a coalition of attorneys general of 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, the complaint alleges that Facebook has engaged in a systematic strategy—including its 2012 acquisition of up-and-coming rival Instagram, its 2014 acquisition of the mobile messaging app WhatsApp, and the imposition of anticompetitive conditions on software developers—to eliminate threats to its monopoly. This course of conduct harms competition, leaves consumers with few choices for personal social networking, and deprives advertisers of the benefits of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that could, among other things: require divestitures of assets, including Instagram and WhatsApp; prohibit Facebook from imposing anticompetitive conditions on software developers; and require Facebook to seek prior notice and approval for future mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Personal social networking is central to the lives of millions of Americans,” said Ian Conner, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Facebook’s actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition. Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video by Ian Conner, Director of the Bureau of Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;video/mp4 icon&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/sites/all/themes/ftc/images/icons/video-x-generic.png&quot; title=&quot;video/mp4&quot;/&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization/connor_video_fb.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4; length=107564008&quot;&gt;Download MP4 (11.43 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization/statement_of_ftc_bc_director_ian_conner_on_fb_enforcement_action.pdf&quot;&gt;Statement by Ian Conner, Director of the Bureau of Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FTC’s complaint, Facebook is the world’s dominant personal social networking service and has monopoly power in a market for personal social networking services.  This unmatched position has provided Facebook with staggering profits. Last year alone, Facebook generated revenues of more than $70 billion and profits of more than $18.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticompetitive Acquisitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FTC’s complaint, Facebook targeted potential competitive threats to its dominance. Instagram, a rapidly growing startup, emerged at a critical time in personal social networking competition, when users of personal social networking services were migrating from desktop computers to smartphones, and when consumers were increasingly embracing photo-sharing. The complaint alleges that Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, quickly recognized that Instagram was a vibrant and innovative personal social network and an existential threat to Facebook’s monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that Facebook initially tried to compete with Instagram on the merits by improving its own offerings, but Facebook ultimately chose to buy Instagram rather than compete with it. Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012 allegedly both neutralizes the direct threat posed by Instagram and makes it more difficult for another personal social networking competitor to gain scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, according to the complaint, Facebook perceived that “over-the-top” mobile messaging apps also presented a serious threat to Facebook’s monopoly power. In particular, the complaint alleges that Facebook’s leadership understood—and feared—that a successful mobile messaging app could enter the personal social networking market, either by adding new features or by spinning off a standalone personal social networking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that, by 2012, WhatsApp had emerged as the clear global “category leader” in mobile messaging. Again, according to the complaint, Facebook chose to buy an emerging threat rather than compete, and announced an agreement in February 2014 to acquire WhatsApp for $19 billion. Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp allegedly both neutralizes the prospect that WhatsApp itself might threaten Facebook’s personal social networking monopoly and ensures that any future threat will have a more difficult time gaining scale in mobile messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticompetitive Platform Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint also alleges that Facebook, over many years, has imposed anticompetitive conditions on third-party software developers’ access to valuable interconnections to its platform, such as the application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that allow the developers’ apps to interface with Facebook. In particular, Facebook allegedly has made key APIs available to third-party applications &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the condition that they refrain from developing competing functionalities, and from connecting with or promoting other social networking services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that Facebook has enforced these policies by cutting off API access to blunt perceived competitive threats from rival personal social networking services, mobile messaging apps, and other apps with social functionalities. For example, in 2013, Twitter launched the app Vine, which allowed users to shoot and share short video segments. In response, according to the complaint, Facebook shut down the API that would have allowed Vine to access friends via Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit follows an investigation by the FTC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2019/10/whats-name-ask-technology-enforcement-division&quot;&gt;Technology Enforcement Division&lt;/a&gt;, whose staff cooperated closely with a coalition of attorneys general, under the coordination of the New York State Office of the Attorney General. Participating Attorneys General include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission vote to authorize staff to file for a permanent injunction and other equitable relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was 3-2. Commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine S. Wilson voted no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Commission issues a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission works to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-competition&quot;&gt;promote competition&lt;/a&gt;, and protect and educate consumers.  You can learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/competition-counts/zgen01.pdf&quot;&gt;how competition benefits consumers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/faq/competition/report-antitrust-violation&quot;&gt;file an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube to remove content that alleges widespread election fraud</title>
<link>https://thehill.com/policy/technology/529414-youtube-to-start-removing-content-alleging-widespread-election-fraud</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehill.com/policy/technology/529414-youtube-to-start-removing-content-alleging-widespread-election-fraud</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;YouTube said Wednesday it will start removing any content uploaded to its platform that contains allegations of widespread fraud or errors in the 2020 presidential election after Tuesday's so-called safe harbor deadline that essentially locked in President-elect &lt;span class=&quot;rollover-people&quot; data-behavior=&quot;rolloverpeople&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;rollover-people-link&quot; data-nid=&quot;188332&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rollover-people-block&quot; id=&quot;rollover-people-188332&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rollover-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/blogs/bidenjoe_081315getty_0.jpg?itok=pS6Ifqu9&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;name&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/529372-trump-jr-cuts-ad-for-loeffler-perdue-in-georgia&quot;&gt;Trump Jr. cuts ad for Loeffler, Perdue in Georgia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/529369-biden-to-tap-vilsack-for-agriculture-secretary-reports&quot;&gt;Biden to tap Vilsack for Agriculture secretary: reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/529353-georgia-elections-official-trump-should-act-more-responsibly&quot;&gt;Georgia elections official: Trump should 'act more responsibly'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;more&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;’s victory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The deadline marked the date by which all states are required to have resolved any election-related disputes. &lt;span class=&quot;rollover-people&quot; data-behavior=&quot;rolloverpeople&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;rollover-people-link&quot; data-nid=&quot;261287&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump&quot;&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rollover-people-block&quot; id=&quot;rollover-people-261287&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rollover-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/trumpdonald_070117getty.jpg?itok=YIP2hsPW&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;name&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/529377-trump-taps-conway-chao-to-government-posts-in-waning-days-of&quot;&gt;Trump taps Conway, Chao to government posts in waning days of administration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/529376-pelosi-schumer-hit-trump-but-cite-progress-in-covid-relief-talks&quot;&gt;Pelosi, Schumer hit Trump but cite 'progress' in COVID relief talks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;people-articles&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/house/529373-house-gop-leader-trolls-democrats-over-reduced-majority&quot;&gt;House GOP leader trolls Democrats over reduced majority&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;more&quot; href=&quot;https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, however, has not conceded the race, even as state officials have certified their election results showing Biden has the Electoral College votes to be the 46th president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/?utm_campaign=wp_the_technology_202&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_technology202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube said content “that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome” of the presidential election will be removed. The update applies to content uploaded Wednesday or anytime after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;dfp-ad-incontent_desk_1-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;dfp-tag-wrapper wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The move does not appear to involve the removal of any content fitting that description if it was uploaded before Wednesday, though&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; YouTube said that since September it has terminated more than 8,000 channels and “thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos” for violating its existing policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube said 77 percent of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views, meaning about a quarter may have reached a wide audience before they were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Democrats have increasingly criticized social media platforms over their handling of election misinformation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of Facebook and Twitter have frequently come under scrutiny from lawmakers this year, but YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has not been summoned for Senate hearings like other social media executives. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also appeared before a Senate panel, but he has largely not faced questions over YouTube, which is owned by Google.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Former Tesla engineer sues for defamation</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-12-08/tesla-called-her-a-criminal-now-shes-representing-herself-at-the-ninth-circuit-court-of-appeals#2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-12-08/tesla-called-her-a-criminal-now-shes-representing-herself-at-the-ninth-circuit-court-of-appeals#2</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The woman from human resources opened the doors — those big heavy fire doors with the push bars. She led the way through an unlighted, windowless room, draped in plastic, smelling of paint. Cristina Balan grew nervous. “This doesn’t look like the way to Elon’s office,” she thought to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was led, she said, through another door into a room where she saw two large men in security uniforms behind desks. They were ordered to wait outside. Balan’s boss walked in. Balan was told to sit in a rolling desk chair. They were joined by a company lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was not proceeding as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks earlier, in a companywide email, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had dumped on the concept of corporate hierarchy. Find “the fastest way to solve a problem to the benefit of the whole company” and don’t worry about your boss, he told them. Go straight to the top, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;google-dfp-ad-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan took him up on it. An automotive engineer at the electric car maker’s Fremont, Calif., assembly plant, she was motivated by Tesla’s save-the-planet mission and wanted it to succeed, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she was bothered to see what she believed were contracts awarded based on friendships more than quality and price. She had also been raising concerns about floor mats installed in the then-new Model S that tended to curl up under the pedals, a potential safety hazard. Defective mats have caused crashes in other automakers’ vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sent Musk an email and asked for a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the HR manager appeared at her desk and said, “So you want to talk to Elon, right? Well, let’s go.” But as soon as Balan saw the dark room with the plastic drapes, “I knew I should have returned to my desk,” she said. “This is weird, I thought. This is not going to be a meeting with Elon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;google-dfp-ad-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Balan said, she was forced to resign, an event that launched a six-year legal journey leading to where she is today: about to face off against Tesla — on her own, without an attorney — in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defamation is the main claim in Balan’s suit against Tesla — the company &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;http://deleter.net/index.php/news/5541/Business/September-11-2017/Reporter-Writes-Glowing-Article-About-Elon-Musk-But-Leaves-Out-Key-Details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accused her of criminal behavior&lt;/a&gt; on a popular online news site but provided no evidence to back up the charge. Balan says her professional reputation suffered damage so severe she can’t find a company willing to hire her. “They tell me, ‘We’d like to hire you, but we can’t afford to be on Musk’s blacklist,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 lawsuits have been filed against Tesla and Musk, a number of them alleging defamation, including the case in which Musk called a rescue diver who criticized him a “pedo” on Twitter and a “child rapist” in an email to a reporter without offering evidence. (A Los Angeles jury found the diver was not defamed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Balan’s appeals case goes beyond defamation. It raises questions about the limits of the legal practice known as mandatory arbitration, about whether an arbitration agreement can follow an employee for years or even decades after they’ve left a company — which is what Tesla lawyers argue as they attempt to keep the case out of court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of employees in corporate America are asked to sign arbitration contracts, often with little knowledge of what they’re signing away. Given Tesla’s high profile, said Imre Szalai, an arbitration expert at the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, “this will be a leading case on the topic of arbitration and defamation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pliers-no-dolls&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Pliers. No dolls.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristina Balan grew up with grease under her fingernails in the Transylvania region of Romania. Other girls played with dolls. She took engines and motors apart and put them back together again. “I was fascinated with everything mechanical,” she said. “My toys were pliers and screwdrivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That set off some cluck-clucking among the neighbors. “I got a lot of badmouthing,” said her father, Ion Carstoc, then a mechanic at Romania’s national automotive research center and now retired. “I’ll never forget, one [neighbor] called me names, telling me to be a responsible parent. She said, ‘Cristina’s got oil on her clothes, she’s got oil in her hair. You need to teach her how to be a woman!’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan shrugged off the neighbors. After earning an engineering degree at Transylvania University of Braşov, she was hired by Boeing and traveled the world to work with suppliers for the 787 aircraft. In 2010, Tesla hired her to help design the battery pack for the now-iconic Model S all-electric luxury sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on evidence reviewed by The Times, Balan was well regarded by fellow workers and managers. Her performance reviews were glowing. She was known as a hard worker who put in long hours and was dedicated to creating high-quality products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her initials are etched onto the battery pack clamshell cases she designed, which still can be found in older versions of the Model S. A performance review, entered in court, lauded her, saying, “She is often consulted by engineers from various departments when they come upon perplexing design and CAD challenges.” (CAD stands for computer-aided design.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2014 email from Daniel Ho, a top Tesla executive who now runs the Model 3 program, singled Balan out for praise. “Without creative engineers like you, this place would be just another car company,” he said. “DON’T LET THAT HAPPEN!” Ho did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety-concerns&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Safety concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan’s problems began after she joined the interior fittings team. She developed a way to replace flip-down sun visors with touch-based windshield-dimming technology. Tesla never adopted it, but emails show the idea was reviewed by Musk, who urged that development be continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All seemed to be going well until Balan came across what she considered sketchy dealings on supplier contracts and the curling floor mats. She said interior-engineering supervisors at the time acknowledged safety issues but noted that a recall on the floor mats would have been expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After she emailed her concerns to Musk, a Tesla lawyer took her aside, she said, and told her that if she continued to push matters, she should remember that some of her friends at Tesla had green card applications pending. (Contacted by The Times, the lawyer denied saying this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla was struggling for solvency at the time. It hadn’t yet become &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-22/why-the-stock-market-is-so-high-and-tesla-even-higher&quot;&gt;a stock market darling&lt;/a&gt;. Cash flow was low. The future depended on the Model S’ success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;google-dfp-ad-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money wasn’t the only problem. Musk was dealing with quality-control issues, some potentially dangerous. The company was installing cooling systems in earlier versions of the Model S that it &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-01/federal-safety-officials-probe-tesla-battery-cooling-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;knew were prone to leak&lt;/a&gt;. After recent stories on the matter, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has acknowledged it is conducting an investigation. Following reports that wheels fell off due to cracked ball joints and control arms, the Chinese government recently ordered a major recall of older Model S cars. Tesla says it will obey, but the company has &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-10-23/china-forces-recall-of-30-000-tesla-models-s-and-x-for-to-repair-suspension-systems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blamed China’s drivers&lt;/a&gt; for the problem, not its own products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the Model S project was the top priority at Tesla in April 2014, when Balan was walked into that security office. According to Balan’s recollection, the HR manager strongly suggested she drop her complaints about the supplier contracts. Balan said no. “OK, this is your exit interview,” Balan recalls being told. She was handed resignation papers and asked to sign them. When she protested, she said, a Tesla official threatened to have her led outside in handcuffs and told her, “This is what happens if you don’t know how to keep your mouth shut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan felt intimidated and wanted to get out of there, she said. Even so, she insisted on adding a line to the documents: “I’m resigning for the position that I was put in a month ago bc I dare to speak up to the Sr management, also bc people that had the chance to speak up were threatened...” she wrote. The security guards escorted her from the building and into the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tesla wasn’t through with her yet. After she filed an arbitration claim against the company, the Huffington Post ran a 2017 story about her case. After it ran, Tesla communications executive Dave Arnold demanded that the online publication run a 600-word Tesla response in full. In part, it read, “Ms. Balan spent company time working on a ‘secret project’ without her manager’s approval and booked an unapproved trip to New York at Tesla’s expense to visit a potential supplier for her own personally-created project. She also illegally recorded internal conversations within Tesla without anyone’s permission, which is clearly criminal conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold’s piece offered no evidence to substantiate his assertions, and the Huffington Post later took the story down, though an archived version &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;http://deleter.net/index.php/news/5541/Business/September-11-2017/Reporter-Writes-Glowing-Article-About-Elon-Musk-But-Leaves-Out-Key-Details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remains online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Model S team surprised Balan by having her initials etched on the car’s battery packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “secret project,” Balan has shown through emails and other documents entered in court, was no secret at all. It was the windshield sun visor project that had attracted support from Tesla top executives, including Musk, whom she briefed personally about the technology behind it, according to emails entered into evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Field, then Musk’s operational right hand man, issued several emails on the topic, including one that read, “This one is a no-brainer; let’s spend the money. It might be too late for [Model] X but this could be a big feature on future vehicles.” (Field, now an executive at Apple, told The Times he preferred not to discuss the case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to Balan’s “unapproved” trip to New York, Rich Heley — then head of manufacturing technology at Tesla and now an engineering executive at Facebook — sent Balan an email that stated “you should go to ny.” (Heley declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan filed her defamation claim in January 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;staying-out-of-court&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Staying out of court&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a public offensive by Tesla’s media department failed to deter Balan, the company’s lawyers took a different approach: Keep the whole thing in arbitration and under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitration system in the U.S. goes back to 1925, when Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act. The main purpose was to relieve the burden on the court system by moving business contract disputes into another forum. The variety of cases subject to arbitration has mushroomed since then. By the 1980s, the insistence that new hires sign arbitration agreements as a condition of employment became standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2018 study by Alexander J.S. Colvin for the Economic Policy Institute estimates that 60 million American workers have &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration-access-to-the-courts-is-now-barred-for-more-than-60-million-american-workers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed arbitration contracts&lt;/a&gt; with their employers — and that such contracts are more common for low-wage workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;google-dfp-ad-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law professor Szalai found that &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;http://employeerightsadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NELA-Institute-Report-Widespread-Use-of-Workplace-Arbitration-March-2018.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;80% of the 100 largest&lt;/a&gt; U.S. companies have used arbitration in workplace disputes, and said the actual percentage was almost certainly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented with Balan’s claim that she had been defamed, Tesla’s lawyers pointed to her employment agreement to argue the matter must remain in private arbitration and not in public court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsha J. Pechman, senior judge of the U.S. District Court in Seattle, disagreed. In June 2019, she found that although some of Tesla’s allegations were directly related to employment and must remain in arbitration, others could be tried in federal court, including whether Balan was defamed by Tesla’s assertion of criminality. She noted that Tesla had not made a case to back up the charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also questioned Tesla’s legal stance: “It’s your position that, if 30 years from now there is a newspaper article that the plaintiff finds somehow maligns her, that no matter how old she is, no matter how far away her employment was from this, that she has to arbitrate it? She has forever signed away any cause of action that might mention her prior employment?” she said, according to a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;google-dfp-ad-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla lawyers had no direct answer but filed an appeal to the 9th Circuit. Oral arguments were set to begin in November, but Tesla lawyers won a continuance to March. The lawyers said they were busy with other trials. Balan thinks they’re trying to wear her down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of Tesla’s claims against her follow her to this day, she said. She continues to be &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BLSmith2112/status/1319305539327827972&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pilloried on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by some of Musk’s more &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gazzerg23/status/1317551258392211458?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extreme supporters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;musks-track-record&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Musk’s track record&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the details in Balan’s case are unique, Musk’s proclivity to &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-meltdown-20180717-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launch personal attacks on critics&lt;/a&gt; is not. Musk has gone after &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2018/07/05/elon-musk-attacks-media-accuses-journalist-briding-former-employee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; (including this one), &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-20/judge-told-tesla-to-release-evidence-in-short-seller-trial-instead-tesla-dropped-the-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;short sellers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danahull/status/1258563679542374400?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-teslas-factory-a-medical-clinic-designed-to-ignore-injured-workers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;internal critics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times repeatedly sought comment from all parties involved. None of the three law firms that have worked for Tesla on the defamation case would comment. Tesla no longer has a public relations department and does not respond to media inquiries; The Times sent emails to investor relations and several corporate executives, without response. Dave Arnold, now an executive at Facebook, did not respond to several emails seeking comment. The Huffington Post did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that those with plenty of money can use delay tactics to wear down less-flush opponents, as they run out of money to pay their own lawyers. That’s a reason Balan, with a stated net worth of $50,000, gives to explain why she is representing herself — she doesn’t have to pay lawyers, so time is her only expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges tend to support arbitration because it relieves pressure from enormous caseloads, saving the system money and time. (More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought civil proceedings in California to a near-standstill.) Employers like it, Szalai said, not just for speed and convenience, but also because the proceedings are often kept secret, and new hires often sign contracts that ban them from joining class-action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That keeps issues such as sexual harassment and racial discrimination hidden from view, he said, though there are occasional attempts at reform. A bill to limit mandatory arbitration was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019 but was never taken up by the Senate. At Tesla, shareholders rejected an arbitration reform proposal in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some attempts are successful. In 2019 Google ended mandatory arbitration after &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-11-06/google-employee-walkout-tech-industry-activism&quot;&gt;a 2018 walkout&lt;/a&gt; by employees demanding it be abolished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-want-to-clear-my-name&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;‘I want to clear my name’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balan is preparing for the appeals court hearing from a makeshift office in her 11-year-old son’s bedroom, her HP computer on a small wooden desk with a brown glass top. When her son gets rambunctious, she takes her iPad and moves to her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her defamation suit, she’s asking for legal expenses and whatever punitive damages the court sees fit. She said she’d welcome any monetary awards, but money’s not her motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First of all, I want to clear my name,” she said. “I want to see the pride in my parents’ eyes that they’ve had for me all my life. And I want to show the level of vindictiveness Tesla can go to when they want to destroy somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will determine whether she’s able to make her case in a public courtroom — and perhaps whether many others like her will be free to do so in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a seductive tale about the incredible, counterintuitive concept of the “open core” business model for software companies. In &lt;a class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://joemorrison.medium.com/three-models-for-commercializing-open-source-software-84d3130c82cd&quot;&gt;a piece I wrote last year&lt;/a&gt; that no one read, I defined the open core strategy thusly:²&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;jp jq jr&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a9d9&quot; class=&quot;hp hq ih hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;“Open core” businesses offer a free, open source version of their software and a paid version with additional proprietary features that would be a pain to replicate […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8d31&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;For the best in-depth analysis of the concept of the “open core” business model I’ve come across, I highly recommend reading Joseph Jacks’ blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;Open Core — Definition, Examples &amp;amp; Tradeoffs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5fa6&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;The whole idea is insane. No one believes it could possibly work when they first learn about it, and yet dozens of companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://d2iq.com/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;D2iQ&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Mesosphere), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudera.com/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Cloudera&lt;/a&gt; have all managed to achieve valuations in the billions of dollars by pursuing this batshit-crazy, reverse-psychology, let-it-all-hang-out strategy. Or, at least, they were open core businesses at some point…maybe not so much today. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dbfd&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Today, we’re gathered here on the internet to mourn the death of the open core business model. We’re here to tell stories of the before-times, to reminisce about how smart we thought we were. We went against consensus, and we were wrong. Because, open core is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7c43&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Cloud killed open core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8079&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf ko hs ht gi kp hu hv hw kq hx hy hz kr ia ib ic ks id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;In the case of Mapbox GL JS, Mapbox had previously decided to openly license the first two versions of the their browser-based map renderer (the same one that powers Snap Maps, the New York Times, and CNN among &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;myriad others&lt;/a&gt;). Ever since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mapbox.com/introducing-mapbox-gl-7a1f4e960e16&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;initial release in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been incredibly popular among web developers. Once you know what you’re looking for, you start to see it…everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;f364&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;I personally experienced the power of Mapbox GL JS when my team at Azavea started building GroundWork, a tool for labeling satellite imagery. Using functionality from that library, GroundWork supports freeform drawings of complex geometries. The resulting shapes are cartographic — they’re projected onto a real location on earth, not just suspended in imaginary 2D space. It’s the type of feature that feels obvious and straightforward but is in fact extraordinarily difficult to engineer from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0c1f&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Even simple-looking shapes drawn with a freehand technique can contain thousands of individual vertices. Pretty quickly, you fill up your screen with hundreds of thousands of vertices worth of shapes and…oh, poop-and-a-half.³ Your browser crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e344&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Mapbox GL JS helps to circumvent that problem by summoning help from the graphics card on your machine. There’s no way we could have built that feature within our budget and time constraints without piggybacking on Mapbox’s tens of thousands of hours of hard, low-level engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;a00c&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Mapbox’s decision this week to release a brand new version of Mapbox GL JS and keep it proprietary stunned me. Not only was v1 already a wildly popular open source library, but Mapbox’s reputation as a prolific creator of open source software is a cornerstone of their whole identity. Describing what makes Mapbox special without mentioning “open source” is like trying to describe chocolate milk to an alien without using the word “liquid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;23eb&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Mapbox still has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;over 800 open source projects&lt;/a&gt; to their name and has consistently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-top-contributors-to-github-2017-be98ab854e87/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;ranked in the top 40 organizations worldwide&lt;/a&gt; in terms of Github activity on public repositories. They employ (and have previously employed) some of the highest-profile open source software contributors in the world, not just the mapping industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ca6a&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;So…what the &lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;dickens&lt;/em&gt; is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;6b7a&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf ko hs ht gi kp hu hv hw kq hx hy hz kr ia ib ic ks id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Mapbox’s choice to keep v2 of Mapbox GL JS proprietary is a strong signal. But what precisely the signal is indicating is…less clear. Nonetheless, I’ll bite.⁴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e83&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;I &lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it means we’ve reached the end of an era. I think it portends the death of “open core” as a viable business model. My suspicion didn’t start with Mapbox, but it has concluded with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c921&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;To understand how a company like Mapbox decides to release a proprietary update to one of its most popular open source libraries, I think it helps to start by studying at the cautionary tales of two kindred spirits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Mongo DB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Redis Labs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;da09&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Ben Thompson wrote an excellent summary in his piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/aws-mongodb-and-the-economic-realities-of-open-source/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;AWS, MongoDB, and the Economic Realities of Open Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; almost two years ago. To summarize his summary: if you give your secret sauce away for free, and it gets popular enough, cloud providers will inevitably spin up competitive services using your very own code against you. They will ruthlessly, unapologetically, shamelessly bludgeon you with a rubber chicken of your own fashioning. They’ll take a dump in your front yard while your lawyer stands over your shoulder whispering, “nothing can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ffbc&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Since Ben wrote about AWS launching a service directly competing with MongoDB and Redis’s paid offerings, AWS hasn’t exactly crushed the competition…in fact, MongoDB’s stock price has risen over 275% since then, and Redis &lt;a href=&quot;https://redislabs.com/press/redis-labs-raises-100-million-series-f-financing/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;just raised $100M to officially cross the magic $1B valuation threshold&lt;/a&gt; a couple months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Open core is dead, you say? Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/MDB:NASDAQ?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiI3fu5q7_tAhVYGVkFHa_MCU4Q3ecFMAB6BAgBEBk&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Finance&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cecd&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;The bigger story is not simply &lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Mongo and Redis thrived in response to getting shanked by AWS, but &lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they did it&lt;em class=&quot;ih&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Both fought back the way companies always fight back: with an army of IP lawyers. Redis adopted a strategy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.com/redis-commons-clause-open-source-148558.html&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;adding a severely restrictive “commons clause”&lt;/a&gt; to updated versions of their existing open source tools, prompting some prominent open source commentators to feel that they’d thrown the baby out with the bathwater:&lt;/p&gt;

Someday, I hope to create something worthy of being called an “abrogation.”
&lt;p id=&quot;ba63&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Redis later shifted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/redis-labs-drops-commons-clause-for-a-new-license/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;an entirely novel and idiosyncratic license&lt;/a&gt;, which can’t be worse than the commons clause fiasco, but almost certainly isn’t much better. MongoDB also took the “poison pill” legal strategy by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-mongodbs-turn-to-change-its-open-source-license/&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;shifting to a new and equally made-up license for their software&lt;/a&gt;, “Server-Side Public License (SSPL)” shortly after AWS launched its competitive “DocumentDB” service. In both cases, the moves were specifically aimed at making it harder for public cloud providers to screw them over.⁵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7f55&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Perhaps more accurately, they made their open source offerings radioactive to any company large enough to have a department called “compliance.”⁶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9272&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;These changes made Redis and Mongo fundamentally less open. The companies have since done quite well, although perhaps at the expense of their original ideals and some of the goodwill of their early adopters. The open source community of evangelists and contributors felt that they’d been sold a lie and treated as a stepping stone in the process. And I tend to agree with them, although I don’t fault either Redis or Mongo for being rational economic actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;2c15&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf ko hs ht gi kp hu hv hw kq hx hy hz kr ia ib ic ks id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;There is at least one cloud provider that has publicly copy-and-pasted Mapbox code into services they charge for: Azure, Microsoft’s cloud service. Last year, Azure announced map styling powered by Mapbox GL JS and it remains a key feature of their “Azure Maps” service. Mapbox even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mapbox.com/azure-maps-adds-data-driven-styling-powered-by-mapbox-gl-f14d062b79f9&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote an announcement about it on their company blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b008&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;While Mapbox made the Azure announcement out to be a good thing, I suspect it was the beginning of the end for Mapbox GL JS remaining open source. After all —in the incomprehensibly competitive world of public cloud computing, once one cloud provider starts offering a service, the rest are surely soon to follow. Mapbox found themselves in a similar position to Mongo and Redis: they were subsidizing R&amp;amp;D for a handful of trillion-dollar tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2d95&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Unlike Mongo and Redis, Mapbox resisted the urge to try to have their cake and eat it, too. Rather than change the fundamental license for the “open” part of their offering, they made a clean break. The old version, which is still a mature and extremely useful library, will retain its original, permissive license. Efforts are already underway to fork it and gather community members to maintain it indefinitely, which I’m hopeful will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6cba&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;The new version will remain public (the code is all published on Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/pull/10160&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It’s just not permissively licensed anymore. To me, this feels like a more honest approach than trying to thread the needle with a creative and totally unproven license or some “gotcha” clause.⁷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8c4e&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Some might feel that this is a tragedy because it means community contributions will probably fall off. It’s true that, despite a long &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/graphs/contributors&quot; class=&quot;dk ii&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;list of contributors&lt;/a&gt;, current and former Mapbox employees contributed the lion’s share of investment in the library. But the project had attracted a massive, global community of engineers who built things with it, gave tech talks on it, and forked/remixed it countless times. Yesterday was a sad day for those enthusiastic users, there is no question. They’ll survive, but I can’t blame them for feeling a sense of loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eca7&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;As for the question of whether or not this choice strays from Mapbox’s mission or culture, I think this tweet from a current employee who has been with the company since its founding about sums it up:&lt;/p&gt;

Preach, Saman.

&lt;p id=&quot;0864&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf ko hs ht gi kp hu hv hw kq hx hy hz kr ia ib ic ks id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Once upon a time, I really thought you could give away your trade secrets and still be successful. I thought the scale of the internet had enabled a new genre of company that could become massive despite only capturing an infinitesimally small fraction of the value they created. I believed the act of building a company around open source software was virtuous and ethical. I saw it as an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b679&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;These days, I’m not so sure.⁸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f68a&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;I still believe open source software is a powerful force for good in the world. I still think companies can strategically and earnestly contribute to open source software in service of not only their own mission but also the collective good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b44e&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;But, I no longer believe venture-backed companies can responsibly pursue a strategy of giving away the software at the core of their value proposition. I no longer think it’s a feasible model for companies with ambitions of becoming very large or those actively avoiding consulting work. Eventually, if they’re successful, they will be forced to choose between betraying their loyal early adopters and dying a long, slow death by rubber chicken bludgeoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cbbc&quot; class=&quot;hp hq fi hr b gf jk hs ht gi jl hu hv hw jm hx hy hz jn ia ib ic jo id ie ig de dw&quot;&gt;Yesterday was a sad day, indeed. But not because Mapbox did something wrong or disappointing. Because yesterday, I finally conceded to myself:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Elon Musk moves to Texas</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ktvu.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-critical-of-california-leaves-the-state-and-moves-to-texas</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PALO ALTO, Calif.&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;/span&gt; Tesla CEO Elon Musk has left California and is now a resident of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Musk said that the move made sense, amid plans underway for a new Tesla factory in the Austin area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;full-width-image&quot; data-v-098e938a=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8.7898832684825&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.foxtv.com/static.ktvu.com/www.ktvu.com/content/uploads/2020/05/932/524/Tesla-CEO-Elon-Musk.jpg?ve=1&amp;amp;tl=1&quot; data-v-098e938a=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;info&quot; data-v-098e938a=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;12.696498054475&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-v-098e938a=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-v-098e938a=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk talks to the media about the condition of the factory workers who were injured at the Tesla plant earlier in the day, outside of Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, Calif. on Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2013. (Photo by MediaNew&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In revealing his departure from California, the 49-year-old tech executive also took aim at the state and said it has taken innovators for granted with strict regulations that stunted opportunity for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have a forest of redwoods and the little trees can’t grow,” in the interview, which took place during the Wall Street Journal’s annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://ceocouncil.wsj.com/&quot;&gt;CEO Council Summit&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said, &quot;California has been winning for a long time, and I think they’re taking it for granted.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The auto executive also suggested that the Silicon Valley might be declining in relevance in the tech world. “I think we’ll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk’s shift away from California appeared to have been in the works for awhile. Earlier this year, Tesla announced its plans to build a new car plant in Texas, scheduled to start production next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;advert-txt&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in May, Musk threatened to move the company’s operations out of California, amid COVID-19 shelter-in-place rules that forced its Fremont plant to shut down. He filed a lawsuit against Alameda County, which he eventually dropped after resuming production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also in May, when he may have hinted at his exit from the Golden State, where he's resided for some two decades. On Twitter he wrote that he's selling almost all of his physical possessions and “Will own no house.” He later put four Los Angeles mansions and his Hillsborough estate on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk has recently spent a considerable amount of time in Texas, where his rocket company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, has operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are great financial incentives for Musk to leave California for Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a net worth of $134.7B, Musk recently surpassed Bill Gates as the second-richest person in the world, and he's on track to earn more than $50 billion in stock options. If he remained in California, he’d be facing income taxes on the profits when he exercises them. In Texas, there is no income tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott weighed in on rumors about Musk becoming a resident of his state. “Elon Musk reportedly told friends he plans to move to Texas,&quot; the Republican governor tweeted. “Texas is the best state for business. Texas has no state income tax, while California’s is the highest in the country. It just got better because Texas made an income tax unconstitutional.”&lt;/p&gt;
