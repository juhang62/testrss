<title>Rails 6.0</title>
<link>https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/8/15/Rails-6-0-final-release/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/8/15/Rails-6-0-final-release/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Dealing with incoming email, composing rich-text content, connecting to multiple databases, parallelizing test runs, integrating JavaScript with love, and rewriting the code loader. These are fundamental improvements to the fundamentals of working with the web and building fast and fresh applications. This is the kind of work we’ve been doing for the past fifteen years, and we’re still at it. THIS IS RAILS SIX!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the headline improvements! Since Rails 5.2 was released a little over a year ago, we’ve continued our high pace of improvement all over the framework. In 2019 alone, we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/this-year&quot;&gt;had 341 code contributors&lt;/a&gt; submit improvements and fixes. We’ve tried to summarize just some of the goodies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html&quot;&gt;the release notes&lt;/a&gt;, but there are many more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we took a little while longer with the final version than expected, the time was spent vetting that Rails 6 is solid. In fact, GitHub, Shopify, and Basecamp, as well as plenty of other companies and applications, have been running the pre-release version of Rails 6 for months and months in production. We might not have caught everything, but if it’s good enough for GitHub, Shopify, and Basecamp, it’s probably good enough for you too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you going to get with Rails 6? Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/12/13/introducing-action-mailbox-for-rails-6/&quot;&gt;Action Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; routes incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes for processing in Rails. It ships with ingresses for Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mandrill, Postmark, and SendGrid. You can also handle inbound mails directly via the built-in Exim, Postfix, and Qmail ingresses. The foundational work on Action Mailbox was done by George Claghorn and yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/10/3/introducing-action-text-for-rails-6/&quot;&gt;Action Text&lt;/a&gt; brings rich text content and editing to Rails. It includes the Trix editor that handles everything from formatting to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries. The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own RichText model that’s associated with any existing Active Record model in the application. Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model. The foundational work on Action Text was done by Sam Stephenson, Javan Makhmali, and yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34052&quot;&gt;new multiple database support&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy for a single application to connect to, well, multiple databases at the same time! You can either do this because you want to segment certain records into their own databases for scaling or isolation, or because you’re doing read/write splitting with replica databases for performance. Either way, there’s a new, simple API for making that happen without reaching inside the bowels of Active Record. The foundational work for multiple-database support was done by Eileen Uchitelle and Aaron Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31900&quot;&gt;parallel testing support&lt;/a&gt;, you can finally take advantage of all those cores in your machine to run big test suites faster. Each testing worker gets its own database and runs in its own thread, so you’re not pegging one CPU to 100% while the other 9 sit idle by (y’all do have a 10-core iMac Pro, right 😂). Hurray! The foundational work for parallel-testing support was done by Eileen Uchitelle and Aaron Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webpacker is now the default JavaScript bundler for Rails through the new app/javascript directory. We’re still using the asset pipeline with Sprockets for CSS and static assets, though. The two integrate very nicely and offer the best trade-off of advanced JavaScript features with an it-just-works approach to other assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@fxn/zeitwerk-a-new-code-loader-for-ruby-ae7895977e73&quot;&gt;Xavier Noria’s new Zeitwerk code loader for Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. No more const_missing, no more code loading gotchas, hello Module#autoload!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just some of the marque additions, but Rails 6.0 is also packed with minor changes, fixes, and upgrades. Just some I’d call out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33659#issue-209385961&quot;&gt;Proper Action Cable testing&lt;/a&gt;, Action Cable JavaScript rewritten in ES6, protection against DNS rebinding attacks, and per-environment credentials. Also, Rails 6 will require Ruby 2.5.0+ now. You can check out everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v6.0.0&quot;&gt;the individual framework CHANGELOG files&lt;/a&gt; for the nitty-gritty rundown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release was shepherded by release manager Rafael França with support by Kasper Timm Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone who keeps working on making Rails better! Thanks to everyone who uses Rails! I’m incredibly proud to see this open-source framework continue to thrive outside the pressures of market terms and reciprocal guilt. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBwWbFpkltg&quot;&gt;This is a gift we give each other and expect nothing in return&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Big Coal Plants Begin to Close</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/and-now-the-really-big-coal-plants-begin-to-close/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/and-now-the-really-big-coal-plants-begin-to-close/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona shuts down later this year, it will be one of the largest carbon emitters to ever close in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giant coal plant on Arizona’s high desert emitted almost 135 million metric tons of carbon dioxide between 2010 and 2017, according to an E&amp;amp;E News review of federal figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its average annual emissions over that period are roughly equivalent to what 3.3 million passenger cars would pump into the atmosphere in a single year. Of all the coal plants to be retired in the United States in recent years, none has emitted more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Generating Station isn’t alone. It’s among a new wave of super-polluters headed for the scrap heap. Bruce Mansfield, a massive coal plant in Pennsylvania, emitted nearly 123 million tons between 2010 and 2017. It, too, will be retired by year’s end (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060924871&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energywire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Aug. 12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in western Kentucky, the Paradise plant emitted some 102 million tons of carbon over that period. The Tennessee Valley Authority closed two of Paradise’s three units in 2017. It will close the last one next year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/greenwire/stories/1060121089&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenwire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Feb. 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just the economics keep moving in a direction that favors natural gas and renewables. Five years ago, it was about the older coal plants becoming uneconomic,” said Dan Bakal, senior director of electric power at Ceres, which works with businesses to transition to clean energy. “Now, it’s becoming about every coal unit, and it’s a question of how long they can survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal plant closures have been a feature of U.S. power markets for the better part of a decade, as stagnant demand, low natural gas prices and increasing competition from renewables have battered the coal fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous years, most retirements were made up of smaller and lesser-used units (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/stories/1060053677&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climatewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, April 27, 2017). That means the emissions reductions were less substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the United States closed 15 gigawatts of coal capacity, or roughly 5% of the coal fleet. That still stands as a record amount of coal capacity retired in one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the emissions reductions were modest by today’s standards. The units retired in 2015 emitted a combined 261 million tons in the six years prior to their retirement, according to an E&amp;amp;E News review of EPA emissions data. On average, they annually emitted about 43 million tons over that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that to 2018, when almost 14 GW of coal was retired. Those units emitted 511 million tons of carbon between 2010 and 2015. Their combined average annual emissions rate was 83 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend figures to be even more dramatic this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small plants are gone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects almost 8 GW of coal to retire in 2019, or a little more than half the capacity retired in 2015. Yet the units retired this year emitted more than their 2015 counterparts. Between 2010 and 2015, their combined emissions were 328 million tons, giving them an annual emissions average of 55 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors are also at play in the retirement of coal’s behemoths. In some cases, federal air quality regulations or an exodus of customers may have contributed to the closure, said John Larsen, who leads power-sector analysis at the Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Generating Station is a case in point. The plant had already planned to shut down a unit to comply with federal smog regulations. Two utilities with a stake in the facility had either divested from the plant or plan to do so. And the plant’s largest customer announced it could buy power on the wholesale market for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You notice the average size of retired plants going up over time. There are not a lot of small plants left, period,” Larsen said. “Once you’ve cleared out all the old inefficient stuff, it’s logical the next wave would be bigger and have more implications for the climate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats to consider. Units scheduled for retirement generally produce less in the years running up to their closure, meaning the plants that closed in 2015 once emitted more than they did near the end of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also this: The vast majority of super-polluters have no closure date in sight. That’s because massive coal plants generally benefit from large economies of scale. Because they crank out power around the clock, their cost of generating electricity is relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The coal plants remaining have generally installed all the environmental controls,” Larsen said. “There are no additional regulatory threats, or they are cost-effective in a world where gas is $2.50 per MMBtu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another caveat: Coal plant closures don’t guarantee power-sector emissions reductions on their own. In 2018, power-sector emissions increased for the first time in many years because electricity demand rose, prompting natural gas generation to spike (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/stories/1060111765/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climatewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jan. 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there is a notable trend with the current round of plant closures, it is this: The large coal plants closing today are in places like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re not seeing climate policy close these plants,” said Mike O’Boyle, director of electricity policy for Energy Innovation, a nonprofit that advocates for a transition to clean energy. “Coal plants are becoming more expensive to operate over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Key Negotiation of Bluetooth Attack</title>
<link>https://knobattack.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://knobattack.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;About the KNOB Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: The specification of Bluetooth includes an encryption key negotiation protocol that allows to negotiate encryption keys with 1 Byte of entropy without protecting the integrity of the negotiation process. A remote attacker can manipulate the entropy negotiation to let any standard compliant Bluetooth device negotiate encryption keys with 1 byte of entropy and then brute force the low entropy keys in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol commonly used between low power devices to transfer data, e.g., between a wireless headset and a phone, or between two laptops. Bluetooth communications might contain private and/or sensitive data, and the Bluetooth standard provides security features to protect against someone who wants to eavesdrop and/or manipulate your information. We found and exploited a severe vulnerability in the Bluetooth specification that allows an attacker to break the security mechanisms of Bluetooth for any standard-compliant device. As a result, an attacker is able to the listen, or change the content of, nearby Bluetooth communication, even between devices that have previously been successfully paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call our attack the &lt;strong&gt;Key Negotiation of Bluetooth&lt;/strong&gt; (KNOB) Attack. Because this attack affects basically all devices that &quot;speak Bluetooth&quot;, we decided to coordinate public disclosure with industry to try to make sure that workarounds could be put in place. In November 2018 we shared details of the attack with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG)—the standards organisation that oversees the development of Bluetooth standards—as well as the CERT Coordination Center and the International Consortium for Advancement of Cybersecurity on the Internet (ICASI)—an industry led coordination body founded by Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Juniper and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on affected systems see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918987/&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-9506&lt;/a&gt; . The technical details of the attack are available in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/antonioli&quot;&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/francozappa/knob&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; contains the code that we developed to implement and test the KNOB attack, including our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/francozappa/knob/tree/master/poc-internalblue&quot;&gt;PoC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;vulnerable&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Are my Devices Vulnerable?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The KNOB attack is possible due to flaws in the Bluetooth specification. As such, any standard-compliant Bluetooth device can be expected to be vulnerable. We conducted KNOB attacks on more than 17 unique Bluetooth chips (by attacking 24 different devices). At the time of writing, we were able to test chips from Broadcom, Qualcomm, Apple, Intel, and Chicony manufacturers. &lt;strong&gt;All devices that we tested were vulnerable to the KNOB attack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we disclosed our attack to industry in late 2018, some vendors might have implemented workarounds for the vulnerability on their devices. So the short answer is: if your device was not updated after late 2018, it is likely vulnerable. Devices updated afterwards might be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KNOB attack was identified, investigated, and demonstrated by an international team of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Employee Writes Memo About ‘The Burden of Being Black at Google’</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43kd3w/google-employee-memo-about-being-black-at-google</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43kd3w/google-employee-memo-about-being-black-at-google</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjvy3/heres-the-memo-about-the-burden-of-being-black-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a memo he sent before leaving the company&lt;/a&gt;, a former Google employee criticized the internet giant and its employees, noting that he regularly encountered racism during his experience as a Black worker at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjvy3/heres-the-memo-about-the-burden-of-being-black-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The memo&lt;/a&gt;, obtained by Motherboard, is titled “The Weight of Silence,” and argues that Google is lacking in diversity, and that some of its employees make racist or at least insensitive comments about minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Over the last 5 years I’ve heard co-workers spew hateful words about immigrants, boast unabashedly about gentrifying neighborhoods, mockingly imitate people who speak different languages, reject candidates of color without evidence because of ‘fit’ and so much more,” the employee wrote. “So, just as I’m doing with this essay, I ultimately resolved to break my silence. And though I eventually grew more comfortable using challenging moments to educate my co-workers, I never stopped feeling the burden of being black at Google. And the more insensitive comments weighed on me, the less safe I felt here—and the less capable I was of being my best self at work, or myself at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you work or have you worked Google, or another tech company? We'd love to hear from you about workplace culture. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzofb@vice.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author worked at the company for several years before leaving. He confirmed to Motherboard that he did write it, but he declined to comment. We have redacted his name from the memo to protect him against retaliation. The memo was sent internally but we were unable to determine how many people read it or how widely it was shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the memo, the former employee cites a few moments where he felt uncomfortable at Google, particularly after big news events such as the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, and during the ensuing protests against police brutality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I realized that my team simply did not have much to say on the issue of police brutality. This was odd—mostly because I’d watched them debate countless other topics, newsworthy and not, with a proud deftness and alacrity,” the memo reads. “From disappearing Malaysian airplanes to the spread of Ebola to the marriages and divorces of celebrities I’d never heard of, my teammates always had something to say about everything. But when it came to the violent policing of black bodies, they were silent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo highlights once more how several employees at Google are unhappy with how the company treats its employees. In the summer of 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an anti-diversity memo&lt;/a&gt; written by a now former employee caused an uproar within the company. Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmkx/google-employee-alleges-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-in-viral-memo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a new mother shared a memo&lt;/a&gt; complaining that the company discriminated and retaliated against her for being pregnant. This memo is the latest public manifestation of the internal tensions within the company, which were recently detailed extensively in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/inside-google-three-years-misery-happiest-company-tech/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Several university student leaders have said they have received threats directed at themselves and their families from unknown people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents came after the arrest of Keith Fong, the leader of the Baptist University’s student union, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/07/angry-protests-tear-gas-sham-shui-po-arrest-hong-kong-student-leader-possessing-laser-pens/&quot;&gt;possession of offensive weapons&lt;/a&gt; last Tuesday. Officers saw him purchase ten laser pointers, but he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/08/hong-kong-student-leader-arrested-laser-pointers-freed-protesters-challenge-police-safety-tear-gas-rubber-bullets/&quot;&gt;released unconditionally&lt;/a&gt; after being detained for 47 hours. He refused bail conditions offered by the police, but a house search of Fong’s home was conducted before his release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Thursday, Leung Siu-yuk, external vice president of the Baptist University’s student union, said she received a Facebook message from an unknown person called “Luck Lee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message said Leung should think before she does anything, or else the person will go to her home to talk to her family. The message included the address and names of her family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leung said her family also found a poster near her home threatening to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an organised threat against the student union to silence us,” she said. “I am afraid. But I know I have been doing what is right. I will not be silenced.”&lt;/p&gt;

Photo: inmediahk.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leung Yiu-ting, acting president of the Education University’s student union, said he saw a threatening poster – similar to the one targetting Leung – near his home on Thursday morning. The poster included his address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said his family members on Friday morning found there were several unknown men appearing near his home. Leung said the men had knocked on the door and asked if he was inside. Leung was away at that time and the men took no further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Such action was clearly targeting people like us who are serving in university student unions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_219466&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-219466&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566521_982f8273d2_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leung Yiu-ting&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566521_982f8273d2_k.jpg 1050w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566521_982f8273d2_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566521_982f8273d2_k-810x540.jpg 810w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Leung Yiu-ting showing poster threatening to kill him, with his address. Photo: inmediahk.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pang Ka-ho, a former external vice president of the University of Hong Kong student union, said he received threatening messages on Tuesday and Wednesday urging him to surrender himself to the police, or he and his family will be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, he too received a Facebook message from “Luck Lee” threatening to visit his family. The message also included his father’s name and his address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family member of his received a call on Thursday night threatening harm to the family member: “This is not about political views. This is about right and wrong, and our moral values,” Pang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pang said he has reported the case to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_219467&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-219467&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566371_fa02983155_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pang Ka-ho&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566371_fa02983155_k.jpg 1050w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566371_fa02983155_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566371_fa02983155_k-810x540.jpg 810w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Pang Ka-ho showing threatening message with name of his family member and address. Photo: inmediahk.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leung Yiu-ting and Pang Ka-ho both said they had recently been followed by unknown people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fong, who was arrested over the possession of laser pointers, said two police criminal investigation department officers visited his father’s home on Thursday looking for a person surnamed Lee. However, no-one in the household is named “Lee.” Fong does not live with his father, but he was there at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officers, nevertheless, recorded the identity card details of him, his father and his family members. “We will not fear such political suppression or white terror,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_219464&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-219464&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566871_4004a0c18b_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Keith Fong&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566871_4004a0c18b_k.jpg 1050w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566871_4004a0c18b_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/48549566871_4004a0c18b_k-810x540.jpg 810w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Keith Fong. Photo: inmediahk.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Fong said police searched his home when he was under arrest, and it was an unreasonable search. He said the search occurred only 30 minutes before he was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why my home had to be searched when I would be unconditionally released,” he said.  Fong said officers did not take anything from his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has been rocked by over two months of anti-government demonstrations and unrest, as protesters demand a full withdrawal of the ill-fated extradition law bill. Demonstrators are asking for a complete withdrawal of the city’s controversial extradition bill, as well as universal suffrage and an investigation into alleged police brutality.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter locked my account for a nine year old tweet</title>
<link>https://fightthefuture.org/article/twitter-is-trying-to-erase-the-past/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fightthefuture.org/article/twitter-is-trying-to-erase-the-past/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/images/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got an e-mail saying I had violated Twitter’s rules for hateful conduct. I immediately thought my &lt;a href=&quot;https://penguindreams.org/blog/my-accounts-been-hacked-no-it-hasnt/&quot;&gt;account password had been compromised&lt;/a&gt;, or that this was a phishing attempt. I rarely post to Twitter anymore, except to promote this website or other personal projects. The e-mail was real though, and Twitter locked my account for a Tweet I made nearly a decade ago!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/images/twitter-account-lock.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Twitter Account Lock e-mail with offensive tweet&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s honestly a very immature tweet. It’s something I wouldn’t say today. I have personally grown past the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/articles/the-fallout-of-american-anger/&quot;&gt;hate of the two party system&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like I have a clearer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/videos/does-voting-make-a-difference/&quot;&gt;more mature view on American elections&lt;/a&gt;, as well as seeing past the endless media designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/videos/all-trump-all-the-time/&quot;&gt;keep most people angry&lt;/a&gt;. This tweet was from a different era in my life. I’m not proud of it, yet it is a part of my history. Furthermore, it’s nearly a decade old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why now? Why is Twitter locking my account for a nine year old tweet? I can’t imaging anyone going through tweets from 2010 and actively reporting them, so it seems more likely that they must be using some algorithm to go back and find posts they consider offensive, throughout the history of their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings grow. Part of learning to be better people is to be able to look at our past, our inexperience and our embarrassment, and acknowledge that’s who we were. I use to be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/faith/evangelism/&quot;&gt;evangelical Christian&lt;/a&gt;, another thing I’m not proud of. Even though I &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/faith/the-non-theists-wager/&quot;&gt;no longer hold the same views on God&lt;/a&gt;, I acknowledge that past was an important part of my growth and development, and that the experience helps me relate to a whole group of people others have trouble understanding. The majority of our fiction, both novels and movies, depend on characters &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/people/change-and-growth/&quot;&gt;growing throughout the story&lt;/a&gt;. If there is no growth, the stories tend to be boring, and aren’t received well by their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Twitter is scanning old tweets and attempting to erase them, they’re also erasing a part of their history and the history of their users. They’re trying to wash over a troubled situation within our current &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/perspective/context/&quot;&gt;context&lt;/a&gt; by rewriting the past. It’s just another indication that we should stop using third party platforms where we are the product and don’t have control over the content we generate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years I’ve been using an open source, federated alternative to Twitter that uses a protocol called ActivityPub. I run &lt;a href=&quot;https://hitchhiker.social&quot;&gt;my own server&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hitchhiker.social/@djsumdog&quot;&gt;myself&lt;/a&gt; and my friends. People on my server can communicate with other servers that support ActivityPub, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://penguindreams.org/blog/how-google-and-microsoft-made-email-unreliable/&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;. If people on my server don’t like the way I manage it, they can always export their content and start their own, or transfer to someone else’s server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using Twitter back in 2008. Before the age of smart phones, Twitter could send tweets via SMS/text message (hence the 140 character limit) and it was used by many of my friends as a type of group message chat. One of those friends is &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/faith/afterlife/&quot;&gt;no longer with us&lt;/a&gt;, and I wonder what would happen if Twitter locked and censored the account of a dead person. They’d have absolutely no way to respond, and their history on this one corner of the Internet would disappear from the pages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/science/time/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone cares about this Tweet I made in 2010, except the algorithms. I suspect critics of Twitter use their own search algorithms to aggregate offensive Tweets and build statistics for news headlines. Twitter might be trying to meet that criticism by cleaning up and censoring content that they once allowed on their site. It’s not only washing out its own history, but the histories, both the beautiful and the ugly, of all the users that made Twitter what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a clear warning of the upcoming age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fightthefuture.org/article/the-new-era-of-corporate-censorship/&quot;&gt;corporate Internet censorship&lt;/a&gt; that we now live in, and I would hope it would encourage people to start hosting their own long form content, on servers they pay for, instead of being the product of other businesses that manipulate the content and narrative of their users, in order to keep the world safe for their advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Impact of Meditating Every Day</title>
<link>https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation can open up surprisingly many doors when it comes to being more aware, mindful, focused and just at piece with yourself. I try to meditate &lt;a href=&quot;https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day/a-productivity-manifesto&quot;&gt;every morning&lt;/a&gt; for about 15 minutes and been doing that for quite some time now. Originally, I tried to find a way to deal with anxiety, however, after such a long time of practing meditation, I get to observe how my mind and character have changed beyond my original motivation, which I find quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this article I’d like to share how meditating every day has changed the way I think, the way I judge, the way I deal with people, the way I react to (external) stimuli, and pretty much the way I live my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-meditate&quot;&gt;Why meditate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons why people meditate, ranging from dealing with stress and anxiety to being more mindful, focused, and present (in the moment) every day. I first started meditating pretty unregularly out of curiosity after seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/igorminar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Igor Minar&lt;/a&gt;’s talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGeaXo2ZBr0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;(Super)Power Management&lt;/a&gt;, in which he also mentions one of my favorite books &lt;a href=&quot;https://pascalprecht.github.io/favorite-books#search-inside-yourself-the-unexpected-path-to-achieving-success-happiness-and-world-piece&quot;&gt;Search Inside Yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, I soon became part of the group of people that practiced meditation due to stress and anxiety. In fact, for several years during my time of travelling the world and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;teaching Angular&lt;/a&gt; at thoughtram, I had to deal with a series of anxiety and panic attacks that were most likely triggered by stress and me simply being burned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the worst experiences I had was when I was giving a talk at a conference about two years ago. The moment I went on stage my heart rate went up, a thousand thoughts went through my head, I felt out of breath, couldn’t think, let alone speak, straight anymore and just wanted to stop and leave. It’s probably hard to notice when watching the talk now, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PNbAY_eCems?t=52&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;first three minutes&lt;/a&gt; of it were horrible in my head and the feeling kept coming back a few times throughout the talk. A panic attack on stage in front of over 500 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event lead me to picking up meditation regularly again and getting a better understanding of how my mind and body works. I’m glad to say that ever since, I haven’t had any major panic attacks and on top of that, I’m overall happier in life, I’m much more calm and react much better to situations in life like keeping a cool head in heated discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever motivates you to give it a try, it’ll be most likely time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking you have to sit with closed eyes and crossed legs on the ground, saying ”&lt;em&gt;Ooommhhhhh…&lt;/em&gt;” out loud for an hour or so. That is really not the case. You can totally do it, but it’s not necessary. Meditation is all about &lt;strong&gt;being aware&lt;/strong&gt; of how your body feels and the thoughts that go through your head without judging or getting caught up in them. Often, this is done by focusing on a certain part of your body, like the breath or your feet, legs, arms, hands and chest etc. At the end of the day, what you’re aiming for is to keep bringing your attention back to what you’re focusing on, everytime you notice your mind has drifted off. There’s also no requirement to do it for a long time. Just a few minutes every day can already make a difference. There’s even little exercises and techniques that can be applied for just a few seconds, multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally there’s no right or wrong, which makes the whole activity very rewarding. I personally am looking very forward to my meditation session every morning because I know there’ll be 15 minutes of relaxation for my mind. Just keep in mind that it takes some time and practice to get used to focusing on, for example your breath, while your brain is bored and craves for distraction. It’s not unusual to have bad days either, where your mind seems distracted all the time and you can’t manage to focus for just a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recommend using one of the great apps out there that guide you through your meditation sessions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wakingup.android&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Waking Up&lt;/a&gt; (no affiliation, I just use those myself). They both come with free sessions that can be used infinitely, so you don’t have to go all-in and get an annual subscription right away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effects-of-regular-meditation&quot;&gt;The effects of regular meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, here are some of the things that I’ve observed and noticed in my body, mind and character over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;calmness-and-serenity&quot;&gt;Calmness and Serenity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a quite active and impatient personality by nature. I used to rush a lot of things, whether it’s life or work, things had to be done quickly so I could move on to the next thing. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s also core to what lead to all the stress and anxiety I’ve experienced in the past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the biggest changes I’ve noticed is that my mind is overall much more calm. Being calm turns out to be a very good foundation for all things in life! I no longer rush to work on my bike every morning, instead, I enjoy the ride and am more aware of all the people, streets and houses I’m passing by (given that it’s not raining of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to discussions, I can give much more constructive feedback and don’t get too attached to the topic at hand. When I have a lot of things on my plate for the day, instead of getting overwhelmed and stressing out, I just take it one step at a time, at a pace that’s comfortable for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pascalprecht.github.io/posts/meditating-every-day/a-productivity-manifesto#focus-and-execution&quot;&gt;Bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember having a chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThomasBurleson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thomas Burleson&lt;/a&gt;, about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;thoughtram&lt;/a&gt; puts out so many &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thoughtram.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; at such a high pace. After I explained him the process, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, life is not a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I now understand what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-listening&quot;&gt;Better listening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I used to let my thoughts out as soon as they popped up in my head without letting the other person finish their sentence; whether it’s during an argument or simply when the person asked for advice. Despite not being the most polite thing to do, my intention is usually to express my understanding or confusion, and since there’s a lot of empathy I have the urge to let them know my thoughts as soon as possible. Similar things could happen when people tried to build up to questions - I think I know what the question is going to be so I try to answer it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it’s different. I no longer immediately try to respond, instead, I listen. And I keep listening. Even when you’re done, I’ll be listening. At least for a few moments. It’ll give both of us space. Space for you to finish your train of thoughts, maybe you want to add one or another thing. Space for me to process what you’ve said and carefully craft a response that hopefully addresses your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a couple of nice effects as well. The other person will feel and appreciate that there’s “room” to talk and to express what needs to be expressed. It also shows that you’re indeed actively listening and on top of that, you’re taking the time to give a meaningful response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how this can make nearly every discussion in your daily life constructive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;letting-go&quot;&gt;Letting go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not judging anything is one of the key concepts in meditation. Thoughts will come and go. Bad ones and good ones. Some will trigger emotions, others won’t. When these thoughts come up, it’s kind of like watching them from far away without really doing anything about it. No action required, no judgment needed. It’s that moment when we bring our attention back to what we’ve focused on (often the breath). The same applies to feeling tension, heavyness or lightness in the body. It’s not about whether we think it’s good or bad, it’s just about being aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that I’m judging things in my environment much less. It’s almost as if I’m completely neutral to any external stimuli that other times made me react in a certain way, like feeling anxious and offended or getting aggravated. Even things like getting to know new people becomes a completely different game if you don’t (sub)consciously start making up a picture in your head based on your impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting feeling of &lt;strong&gt;curiousity&lt;/strong&gt; that comes with it, which makes me feel humbled throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-creates-headspace&quot;&gt;It creates “Headspace”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might have noticed that a lot of the experiences I’ve mentioned boil down to pausing, slowing down, and creating mental space. It’s interesting how these few, very simple, things can affect pretty much every aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s really just a few moments, all of a sudden there’s time to enjoy the now, there’s time to listen, there’s time to make decisions, and there’s time to be aware of your mind, your body and your surroundings. It’s like watching a movie in a higher resolution on a really good screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could you say no to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothings-perfect-though&quot;&gt;Nothing’s perfect though&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to finish this article by saying that, by no means is my life now all about rainbows and unicorns. It might have sounded a little bit like it, but meditation doesn’t take you to a parallel universe in which everything is just fine. Life will still be hard at times and there’s going to be moments in which I just want to throw everything out of the window. However, at least I now have better tools to deal with such situations. Tools I don’t want to miss anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;シン・エヴァンゲリオン劇場版　特報2.5&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ffbBbB9cA8?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”We finally got a 3D creation tool like paper and pencil”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The reason why Khara, Inc. started moving to Blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara, Inc. is known as Hideaki Anno’s motion picture planning and production company. They are currently working on “&lt;strong&gt;EVANGELION:3.0+1.0&lt;/strong&gt;”, film to be released in June 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_01.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-64761&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_01.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_01-512x303.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_01-768x455.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara announced on July 30th, 2019:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_02.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;2312&quot; height=&quot;1382&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-64760&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_02.jpg 2312w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_02-512x306.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_02-768x459.jpg 768w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_02-1280x765.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2312px) 100vw, 2312px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was titled “Supporting Blender Development Fund”, announcing that they support Blender Foundation on developing the open source 3D creation software “Blender”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, it was not only a story of funding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara and Anime/CG production company “Project Studio Q, Inc.” are preparing to switch their primary 3D CG tools to Blender. Blender will be used for some parts of “EVANGELION:3.0+1.0” they are currently working on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is Khara moving to Blender? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Tool cost” challenges to Anime production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3D CG is essential to modern Anime productions. Not only the so called “animation films” such as those from Pixar and Dreamworks, but it’s now common for 3D CG to be used in many Anime films. 3D CG and hand-drawing make a great combination that improves productivity and quality of Anime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara is a company focusing on a “hybrid of 3D CG and hand-drawing”. They are currently working on “EVANGELION:3.0+1.0” with the same policy. They also founded “Project Studio Q, Inc.” in 2017, a company focusing mainly on the movie production and the training of Anime artists as the joint venture with Dwango Co., Ltd. and Aso College Group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara has been using Autodesk “3ds Max” as their primary tool so far. “EVANGELION:3.0+1.0” production is mainly done with 3ds Max.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;They are now starting to switch from 3ds Max to Blender.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Usually the reason being “due to differences such as quality and functionalities”, but Khara’s reason is different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiroyasu Kobayashi, General Manager of Digital Dpt. and Director of the Board of Khara and President of Studio Q, and Daisuke Onitsuka, CGI Director of Digital Dpt. of Khara and General Manager of Production Dpt. of Studio Q, told about their situation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Simply, the project scale got bigger than what was possible with 3ds Max.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;– Hiroyasu Kobayashi&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_64759&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-64759&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_03.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64759 size-full&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_03.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_03-512x384.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_03-768x576.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-64759&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Khara Director and General Manager of Digital Department and President of Project Studio Q. Mr. Hiroyasu Kobayashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need more production resources from outside, not only from Studio Q. We need cooperative work with friend companies for our production. However, many of those companies are small or middle-sized, so if we stick to 3ds Max it will cause higher management costs.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;– Daisuke Onitsuka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may need a bit further explanation about this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3dx Max is offered by Autodesk on subscription fee basis, this fee is expensive. According to Autodesk’s website, an annual fee for a single user is JPY 254,880. It is expensive still when they offer discounts for multiple users and years. A large company can absorb this cost with a number of users as it has large revenue.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But it turns out to be difficult to recoup those costs of 3ds Max for all users in a company of 20-30 people size. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Different tools are used depending on the studios and works in Anime production. Productivity decreases unless they use the same tools and assets (materials such as models, animation data, etc.). Due to this, they tend to work with companies that use the same tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3ds Max is an excellent tool and one of the industry standards, but in some cases it causes a “lack of artists” due to its high costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, Khara thought of moving to “Maya” which has as many users as 3ds Max in the industry. “We worked with data prepared for both 3ds Max and Maya, for Maya users.” said Onitsuka. But resulted in a duplication of work resources to have the same data twice.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Now, Blender attracted their attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_64758&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-64758&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_04.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64758 size-full&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_04.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_04-512x384.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_04-768x576.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-64758&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Khara Digital Department CGI Director and Project Studio Q Production Department. Mr. Daisuke Onizuka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onitsuka: “As a matter of course, we can produce with the same quality and schedule to maximize the efficiency of our limited budget. Blender is an open source software and available for free. Also, it has almost the same functionalities with other software, so it was undoubtly attractive to us. While we still have the challenge whether a new partner company can use Blender or not, but at least, cost-wise is much simpler, so we are proposing them to use Blender as we use it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No lack of functionalities are blocking the switch. In fact, “Grease Pencil” was key to make the move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course they can not switch the tools if a new tool is lacking functionalities for production. Blender’s reputation has been “for beginners” or “for students” because it was free software. However, the latest version has more functionalities and the difference between Blender and other tools is getting smaller.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Khara had started thinking of the use of Maya 3 years ago, and also about Blender right after that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kobayashi: “We have been watching on it and got the feeling that we can use it as our primary software. Discussing with Onitsuka, we decided that we may be better to use Blender as our primary tool than to use various software in the future.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Takumi Shigyo at production dpt. of Studio Q, has been using Blender also for private use. He is a top “Blender wizard” at Khara and Studio Q. Artists like him helped Khara’s decision to move to Blender. Shigyo spoke about Blender as follows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_64757&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-64757&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_05.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64757 size-full&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_05.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_05-512x384.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_05-768x576.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-64757&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Project Studio Q Production Department. Mr. &lt;span&gt;Takumi Shigyo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I feel the latest Blender 2.8 is intentionally ‘filling the gap’ with 3ds Max to make those users feel at home when coming to Blender. I think the learning curve should be no problem.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;– Takumi Shigyo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grease Pencil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And there was a key functionality that brought Khara to Blender as production studio of “2D Anime works”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;It was “&lt;strong&gt;Grease Pencil&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can draw lines in 3D space directly with a pen, and not only by making 3D models but you can also draw extra details in the animations themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_06.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Grease Pencil stroke&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;882&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-64756&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_06.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_06-512x441.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_06-768x662.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onitsuka: “As for our work, we create an image in 3D, and modify it into each frame as ‘2D Anime’. Even a chief animation director directly modifies each frame manually. We also even add shadows with tools like After Effect afterwards. For example, if we wanted a more sharp elbow in a character, we had to modify the 3D model and insert custom rigs (skeleton) into them. This was time consuming. But Blender enables us to draw with Grease Pencil after the animation is finished. It may not be the way for photo-real CG but it’s a good way for 2D Anime. This helps reducing rigging costs.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“More animators who are not from 3D are choosing Blender as a ‘steppin-up’ tool not only because it is free software but because of Grease Pencil. This is an important factor for our decision.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;– Hiroyasu Kobayashi&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studio Q is also a facility for training new animators. They are hosting a contest for creators “Award:Q”, more and more candidates are using Blender nowadays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shigyo: “We are getting more artists that started by using Blender in Studio Q. We are also seeing more high quality works by Blender users from high school students in Award:Q. I expect these new generations to be the majority working at studios in the future.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cooperation with Blender Foundation to be a leading user in the Japanese Anime industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As mentioned, Khara uses Blender, not only the software itself but also helps the Blender Foundation by joining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fund.blender.org&quot;&gt;Development Fund&lt;/a&gt; as a corporate member.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Masahiro “Rocky” Iwami, Production Manager of Digital Dpt. of Khara and General Manager of Overseas Dpt. of Studio Q, who is the primary contact person with the Foundation, said “We had no special relationship with Blender Foundation before this”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_64755&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-64755&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_07.jpg?x68146&quot; alt=&quot;Khara Studio&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-64755 size-full&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_07.jpg 1024w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_07-512x384.jpg 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/khara_07-768x576.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-64755&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Khara Digital Department Production Manager and Project Studio Q Overseas Division General Manager. Mr. Masahiro Iwami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iwami: “We had the contact information of Foundation chairman Mr. Ton Roosendaal, on their website. We got in touch with him from there. It was lucky that the name of ‘Evangelion’ attracted his attention. He kindly replied back to us immediately. We were glad to know that he thought the news that Japanese Anime companies using Blender was important for both of us. We became the first, leading player in Japanese Anime industry. As a corporate member of the Blender Development Fund, we are expecting our proposals may be closer to the development team. We would like to get closer with the Blender developers community.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the advantages of Blender is being open source, anyone can develop and add their own functionalities to Blender. Regarding this, Kobayashi said “Development details are to come”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onitsuka: “Please understand that we are keeping a good relationship with Autodesk. Not only with Autodesk but also with other companies, we keep requesting improvements. However, it takes time for those improvements to make it to proprietary software. We expect faster improvements by using open source software.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The full switch will take place after “EVANGELION:3.0+1.0”, but Blender is already used in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some people may think “EVANGELION:3.0+1.0” can be made by Blender from the beginning. But pipelines do not switch that fast in reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kobayashi: “Preliminary testing has been done already. We are now at the stage to create some cuts actually with Blender as ‘on live testing’. However, not all the cuts can be done by Blender yet. But we think we can move out from our current stressful situation if we place Blender into our work flows. It has enough potential ‘to replace existing cuts’.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onitsuka: “We will be working on ‘EVANGELION:3.0+1.0’ until June 2020, so all the process cannot be changed before that. But we think we can say that ‘we use Blender from this time onwards’ for the next project. We would like to use and test Blender aggressively in our current ‘EVA’ for the ongoing year.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kobayashi: “There are currently some areas where Blender cannot take care of our needs, but we can solve it with the combination with Unity. Unity is usually enough to cover 3ds Max and Maya as well. Unity can be a bridge among environments.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onitsuka: “Hand-draw animators can start drawing only with paper and pencil. Just like that, 3D CG animators can start creating only with Blender at the same level cost with ‘paper and pencil’. We already started speaking to partner companies ‘let’s use Blender together’. We are just starting now but high quality work Blender can be the best proof that our choice is the right one. What shows our value is the pictures we make, not the techniques and technologies. We want to share the know-hows with studios so that the Blender community will grow through those.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An evil and unpopular computer hacker named “&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/poettering.gif&quot;&gt;Lennart&lt;/a&gt;” tries to install his malicious init system on various BSD and Linux systems.

&lt;p&gt;A more simple approach is used by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshports.org/x11/xtrlock/&quot;&gt;XTransparentLock&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>A Walk in Hong Kong</title>

<description>&lt;strong&gt;08.16.&lt;a class=&quot;date&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2019/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;post_title&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2019/08/a_walk_in_hong_kong.htm&quot;&gt;A Walk In Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://idlewords.com/images/hk-clip.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom fainted the first time she set foot in an American supermarket. It was 1981 and we were freshly arrived in America, and some combination of the culture shock and smell and sensory overload of a Safeway was too much for her, not normally a fainting woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t faint, but I stood transfixed in the cereal aisle. After six long years on Earth, here was a place that understood me. These were cartoon characters, made of pure sugar, that you could eat as a meal. Every box had a toy inside. How could I possibly choose just one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston in that era was not an earthly paradise. But try telling that to visitors like us, dazzled by the sheer abundance of American capitalism. There were superhighways in the center city! Everyone had a giant car! You could drive that car up to a restaurant with a yellow “M” on it, and a teenager would hand you a bucket of pink ice cream through the window! According to the sign on the restaurant, this had happened billions of times. It was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that prelude is to say, coming in to the Hong Kong protests from a less developed country like the United States is disorienting. If you have never visited one of the Zeroth World cities of Asia, like Taipei or Singapore, it can be hard to convey their mix of high density, mazelike design, utterly reliable public services, and high social cohesion, any more than it was possible for me or my parents to imagine a real American city, no matter how many movies we saw. And then to have to write about protests on top of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to write articulately about the Five Demands when one keeps getting brought up short by basic things, like the existence of clean public bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time and location of protests are set via social media alchemy; once you get notified about one, you descend through a spotless mall onto a bright and clean train platform, get whisked away by a train that arrives almost immediately, step out into another mall, then finally walk outside into overwhelming heat and a gathering group of demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s over, whether the demonstrators have dispersed of their own will, or are running from rubber bullets and tear gas, you duck into another mall, and another train, and within minutes are back in a land of infinite hypercommerce, tiny alleys and posh hotels with their lobby on the 40th floor of a skyscraper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone lives in a luxury hotel, man! I get it. But my eyes are like saucers. I ask forgiveness of Hong Kongers if at times I am still that six year old kid, dazzled by what to you is ordinary. You live in a kind of city we Americans can only aspire to, and it’s no wonder you love your home so much you will take any risk to save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, August 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word spreads that there will be a protest in Tai Po, a residential district in the New Territories, close to the border. The protesters have been cycling events through different neighborhoods, as a way of building sympathy with the people, who can look out from their windows and watch the police reaction firsthand. At this point, the police reaction almost inevitably means tear gas, and people have been gassed in their own apartments, on high floors. This is a particular hardship for the sick and elderly, already struggling in the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the deeper causes of the present crisis of legitimacy is the housing crisis in Hong Kong, another way in which the government has failed the people it is meant to represent, and you can see it in the extraordinary density of apartment buildings, each unit pock-marked with an air conditioner, tiny living spaces with some of the highest rents in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tai Po is easily reachable by MTR, the city’s commuter train system. Everywhere except the islands is easily reachable by MTR. The MTR is the one technology the Hong Kong protests could not do without, an autonomous fiefdom that the police mostly stay out of. It is neutral territory. The train ride is uneventful until we get off at Tai Po station, where there are an unusual number of people in black, the color of the protests (lucky is the Hong Konger who started the summer as a goth or metal fan, and has some wardrobe options!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arriving protesters stream out of the station in groups, consolidating as they approach the rallying point in a local park. Volunteers along the way pass out flyers and hold directional signs. There is a mix of ages, though they trend young. The typical Hong Kong protester, researchers tell us, is a college educated professional in their twenties. There is a roughly equal gender balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets around the park are almost free of traffic. After a brief false start in the wrong direction, the crowd turns itself around with hand signals and begins to march. The atmosphere is festive, with lots of chanting of “ga yao” (add oil), the idiomatic phrase that is now finding its way into English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once every few minutes a stray vehicle wanders into our path, and demonstrators take pains to let it through, with self-selected volunteers parting the crowd. If the taxi honks in support, a cheer goes up from the marchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road takes us past lush parkland, where skinny white birds observe us from the treetops, and then through a business district with no police, few pedestrians, and almost no traffic. Many stores along the route have been shuttered in anticipation of the march, but the second-floor restaurant windows are full of curious faces. People are photographing us, and we photograph them back. When someone waves or shouts support, whether from the street or from a passing vehicle, the same cheer goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the windows, we can see couples on dates, curious children with their hands pressed to the glass, and store keepers looking out with an appraising eye. Up in the high rises, old men in undershirts lean down to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Thai restaurant has stayed open. The hand-lettered sign in its window invites demonstrators in for free refreshments. There is nothing you can pay for in a protest - volunteers hand out gas masks, water, tea, and endless flyers, designed and printed with astonishing alacrity in response to each day’s events. Anything you may need, people have donated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the street, a man is sticking post-its to the shuttered storefront of a 7-11, creating another one of the post-it walls that are all over Hong Kong. The airport protest on Friday even had a guy styling himself Memo Man, dressed in a black body suit you could paste notes to, until he looked like a paper hedgehog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of heat and humidity is almost comical. My slavic body is shutting down, in a process so unsettling to fellow marchers that concerned people start offering me water or tiny, single use tissues. These turn into wet confetti the second they touch my face. You might as well try to stop Niagara with a hand towel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay,” I tell them. “This is normal. I’m not dying—I’m Polish.” They edge away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group at this point numbers in the thousands. We pass through another neighborhood of residential high-rises and find ourselves at a large, empty intersection. In the distance on the left there is a pedestrian overpass full of journalists (we can tell because they’ve set up antenna tripods). Beyond the overpass stands a line of cops, their plastic shields glinting in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the police visible, there is a little bit of a hush in the crowd. The march continues in a direction parallel to the police line, to another major intersection. There, volunteers are yelling to offer marchers a choice. We can turn right and walk to a nearby train station. Or we can go left and confront the police. Most people choose to go left, and are handed surgical masks (to hide their faces) if they don’t already have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police station is just ahead, a five-story building with large Eiffel tower-style antennas on the roof. Another line of riot police has blocked the road leading to it, and journalists rush to get pictures. The demonstrators stop and confer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say a few words here about the curious way the protests are organized. The protesters learned in 2014 that having leaders was a weakness. Once the leadership was arrested, the heart went out of the occupy movement, and it lost momentum. So in 2019, there is no leadership at all. The protests are intentionally decentralized, using a jury-rigged combination of a popular message board, the group chat app Telegram, and in-person huddles at the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like it shouldn’t possibly work, but the protesters are too young to know that it can’t work, so it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters divide themselves into groups based on how much they can risk being arrested. The issue is not jail time, but the prospect of losing a job or being kicked out of school, now that China has shown it will crack down ferociously on companies that employ demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontmost group are the people who actually come into contact with the police, and put themselves at greatest risk of arrest. Behind them there is a supply group, who passes water and other essentials forward, and helps those in front if they are hurt. And behind that is the great body of demonstrators. Those who will be up front are given leeway to make decisions, including telling the crowd to move back and make room, or deciding to disperse and reassemble elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these frontline protesters have formed a huddle to discuss the tactical situation. Protesters around them shield the group from surveillance with umbrellas. The police watch, and the rest of us wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are all over these protests. Members of the local press wear yellow vests marked PRESS, and put on headgear if things start to get spicy. Some of the foreign correspondents elect to dress more elaborately, looking like they’re about to explore the lunar surface rather than interview a tiny retiree. You can spot key events or celebrities in the protests by looking for the circle of yellow vests, and pyramid of selfie sticks raised above whatever is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters, like beavers, have a strong building instinct. They want to make barricades. The preliminary huddles have expressed concern that we are not on favorable terrain. The police is dead ahead, the street is bordered by a culvert and stream, and it would be too easy to cut the protesters off from behind. So a new set of huddles forms, screened by umbrellas, and after a few minutes we see that they have reassembled steel barricades into triangle shapes, held together by plastic ties, which they will assemble and tie together to block the side roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great hurrah goes up as a group of masked protesters runs one of these triangles down the road, the crowd zippering open in front of them. As they run, the umbrella holders run alongside to keep them screened. Another triangle platoon runs its barricade down to the intersection.. And then - disaster! A third triangle is rushed down the street, but the squad misses their turn, and races off into the distance. The crowd roars for them to stop. Far down the road, they skid to a halt, re-form, and rush back. More cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of us stand and watch this business unfold. It is four o’clock and the heat is cooking me from within. A breeze is blowing towards the police line, and there is speculation that this is why the police have not fired tear gas. The foreign journalists in their body armor are all up at the front of the protest, so there is a disorienting dynamic where people further back can follow a Bloomberg live stream what is happening two hundred meters to their front. Flummoxed by the wind, the police have instead brought out pump tanks of pepper spray, like giant hot sauce dispensers, and are brandishing them at the front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More time passes. Finally, the decision surfaces that the position is too unfavorable. This has been another development in the protesters’ tactics since the start of the summer. Rather than standing their ground, they have found it more effective to melt away and reassemble somewhere else. The tactic is a classic one, but I am impressed with the ability of a decentralized group to adopt it so effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, everyone makes their way back to the train station, where again things transition to normal, as if a street protest with thousands of participants hasn’t just happened. The trains absorb the extra passengers easily (the New York subway would be in flames), and we return to the heart of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, August 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day there is an authorized protest in Victoria Park, where a dour Queen Victoria in the late years of her reign sits sweltering on a metal throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These authorized protests are becoming rare, even though Hong Kongers are supposed to enjoy freedom of assembly. In June and July, the police would routinely grant the permits that the leaderless protests always found a way to apply for. More recently, the police have switched tactics and are now refusing permits, then tear-gassing the inevitable illegal assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today’s rally is official. Demonstrators line the edges of the big open basketball courts and soccer fields, wherever there is a scrap of shade. A first aid station has been set up by the medical volunteers, and free water and electrolyte drinks are available to everyone. The air is still, making the heat worse, and for hours nothing really happens, just a crowd standing and half-listening to speakers rallying the crowd from the stage. A small group of Buddhists has set up incense and performs a ceremony in the frame of a soccer goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipating where the real protest will happen feels just like hoping you’re one of the people cool enough to be told about the afterparty. You keep one eye on the cool kids, in this case the fully masked protesters. As long as they are still around, we know we haven’t missed out on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, around six o’clock, two lines of people form up and start to move. We are on the march.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd shifts and reconfigures to start making its way out of the park. We file past groups of Indonesian women in hijab, sitting on flattened cardboard and having their picnic in the park. No amount of politics is going to deprive them of their precious day off. Queen Victoria looks down at us with disapproval, and then, just like that, we a re an illegal assembly. Speakers at the edge of the park blare out an awful, saccharine anthem as we reach the main road. I put on my hard hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe this is the tenth week of protests. The energy and numbers are just astonishing. In spite of the relentlessness of the police, in spite of the beatings from thugs who the authorities have allowed to rough up people with impunity, every weekend Hong Kongers come out to march.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move in the direction of City Hall, down a thoroughfare lined with Times Square-like animated advertising. The crowd boos and shines lasers on a large animated sign belonging to a mainland Chinese newspaper. Then there is a sudden stop and a sea of hand gestures, thumb and pinky out, hands twisting rapidly. Someone up in the vanguard needs an Allen wrench! This is procured and passed, and then the gesture turns to a “C” shape. They need a monkey wrench!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whatever barricade full of hex nuts that is impeding our progress gets dismantled, and the crowd flows on through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The march is entering the administrative heart of the city. It parts for a while to let through some trapped buses and taxis, and then re-forms again, moving toward Central. We are getting close to police headquarters, and soon a decision will be necessary. As we get closer, all motion stops, more consultative huddles form, and twenty or so aimless minutes go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a hand gesture. Retreat. The police are too strong here. The crowd heads back in the general direction of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman standing on a concrete planter by the MTR station is yelling “go to Tsim Sha Tsui!”. People are looking at their phones, checking the latest news. Some of the Telegram groups around the protests have tens of thousands of participants, and information gets amplified quickly. We decide to follow the woman’s advice and take the train to Kowloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down in the MTR, it’s a different world. Though we have just left a huge protest march, here we are in the midst of families, couples on dates, elderly people, women in saris, white expats in business clothes. The helmets come off and we again join the ranks of the lawfully assembled, the train system effortlessly absorbing a surging crowd that would turn BART into a mass tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Tsim Sha Tsui station we meet an arriving train full of demonstrators, some already wearing pink-capped respirators. We follow them up and out onto the street, emerging somewhat unexpectedly outside a mosque, where a South Asian woman on the steps is yelling “no photos!”. She doesn’t mean not to photograph the mosque. Rather, she’s yelling at people who are taking photos of the demonstrators from its steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now in the heart of the tourist district, with hotels and fancy restaurants all around us. If I came here during the day, I would be stopped and asked a dozen times if I wanted my clothes tailored. Tonight, the tailors have stayed home. The street is a sea of black-clad people in masks and hard hats. Word goes around that tear gas has already been fired two blocks away, and I fumble to get my equipment on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Persian poets say the nose is the outpost of the face. I am normally proud of mine. Its great bulk has preceded me into every difficult situation in my life, sniffing out both danger and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mask I bought here is designed for more delicate faces than mine. When I put it on, it somehow channels the air I exhale directly into my goggles, which fog up instantly. I can only see for a few seconds at a time before the world turns into a white mist. But, I reason, not being able to see from condensation will be much better than not being able to see from tear gas. I hang goggles and mask around my neck and await developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd has begun to move in the direction of the police. Up ahead, someone is waving a big black flag with the Hong Kong emblem on it. They are silhouetted against a pale cloud of smoke, and as I watch I see streams of more smoke falling in arcs around the flag waver. That is the tear gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people around me are filling bottles with water. Tear gas is kind of a misnomer - it’s a solid dispersion that gets deliverd through a burning smoke bomb. You can extinguish it by dousing it in water The kids have a well-practiced assembly line going, delivering water to the front line, and I try to stay out of everybody’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply volunteers are handing out wet wipes (to get the chemical residue off your skin) and single-use plastic sticks of saline solution for an eye rinse. I am just moving up to get a better view of the flag waver when a tear gas canister lands at my feet, and I suddenly remember an important engagement elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are in a foreign land with strangers, it is good to have shared interests. They bring people together across cultural and linguistic barriers. Right now, the crowd and I are all deeply interested in moving back a bit. As we go, medical volunteers approach people who have been affected by the tear gas and help them rinse their eyes. “Don’t rub.” Everybody is tended to. Hong Kong protests have better medical care than any place in America, I think, in another of those little culture shock moments that keep lifting me out of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, the situation is static. I notice the flag waver has never stopped, defiantly waving right in front of the police line. Word comes that the police have now raised an orange warning flag, which means they will use rubber bullets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front line asks for people to move further back, and we comply. It is dangerous to look directly back into the crowd because of the dozens and dozens of green lasers being beamed in the direction of the police (who have taped foil to their visors as a defense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, I hear a tremendous cheer go up. A group of protesters rushes past with their prize, a tall section of scaffolding they have detached from a nearby work site. The lasers dance over it in celebration. It is rushed forward for barricade duty on the front line. I see other people forming a bucket brigade to pass up water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for no reason I can see, there is panic. People are running flat out, and I worry about being knocked down in the surge. I catch the briefest glimpse of a woman with no protective gear, dressed normally, who is weaving her way upstream through the escaping demonstrators with a placid smile on her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the running subsides, I duck behind a tree in the median. I don’t know what’s going on, only that people ran and now have stopped running. Someone says that the police line has pushed forward. Then there is a new sound from up front, the pop-pop-pop of rubber bullets being fired, and people start to run again. “When in Rome,” I think to myself, and our little group legs it into the first side street we can find. And there we come across an open snack stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Snacks!” I cry, taking off my helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tear gas, adrenaline, and the advancing riot police behind us, an appetizing line of skewers is displayed in neat rows ahead of us, in front of vats of steaming broth. The choice is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I select skewers of indeterminate seafood and wait for them to be heated by the completely unfazed proprietor. We are in little side street full of boutiques, stores and restaurants, many of them still open, the owners standing outside to assess the situation. Other demonstrators are filing past in their headgear deciding which way to go to avoid the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put my mask and goggles in the backpack, and return to the role of ordinary tourist. In this respect, I am far more fortunate than Hong Kongers, who will have to worry about being stopped at random by police on their way home, and being caught with masks and helmets on their person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t get over the oddness of the situation. In one direction is bedlam, in the other complete normalcy, separated by a few hundred meters. Some actual tourists are weaving about, worried, and demonstrators turn them around if they accidentally head towards the tear gas. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skewers eaten, we elect to call it a night, and find our way to the nearby MTR train station. The escalator at the entrance is not working, the first time I’ve seen anything fail to function in this indomitable train system. Underground, the station is packed with demonstrators, and illuminated signs above our heads apologize for the slight disruption in service. Trains are now running every seven minutes, instead of every two, and MTR regrets the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sympathetic subway workers have opened the gates to the platform, so people can get to the platform without a potentially trackable swipe of their Octopus card (the magic rechargeable card with which you can buy almost anything in t he city).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, just as we are descending the escalator to the train tracks, a group of demonstrators rushes in behind us and calling for everyone to run—the police are coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the scariest moment of the night, as a quick stampede starts in the very confined space of the escalator. I am terrified that someone will trip and get trampled. On the train, people are holding the doors open, and yellow-shirted MTR personnel appear to restore order. Protests are protests, but the MTR must run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night, we will learn that in another subway station, police fired tear gas canisters directly at people, a terrible thing to do in a confined space. There is video of police beating unarmed protesters savagely on an MTR escalator. And the whole city sees the pictures of a young medic who lost the vision in her eye after police shot her in the face with a bean bag round. The outrage from those acts of violence will provoke the massive protests that shut down the airport on Monday and Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that news is still a few hours away, and again the MTR performs its alchemy of taking us into a world apart, the skyscrapers and hotels around Central, where the view is of tankers and brightly lit junks drifting through the harbor, and there is no sign at all of the turmoil we have just witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the Hong Kong I saw last weekend. I don’t know - I suspect no one knows - what will happen tomorrow. The only sure thing is that people will march. There are many Hong Kongers and other smart people writing online who can explain the political context of the protests, the likelihood of intervention, and what this means in a deeper way. I am just a visitor who perhaps thinks too much about fish cakes when being tear gassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hope everyone stays safe, that the inevitable protests this weekend are allowed to proceed peacefully, and that those in a position to escalate the crisis instead recognize the fundamental reasonableness of what Hong Kongers are asking for—to be ruled by the agreed laws, applied fairly to all. Above all, I hope no one is hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the many, many Hong Kongers who have shown kindness and gone out of their way to welcome visitors to their city even in these difficult times, I want to offer my deepest gratitude. What to me is something to observe and write about, to you has become a question of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for letting me join you in your city, and see what you are experiencing at first hand. I know that in America, all our hearts will remain with you, and with Hong Kong, whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
