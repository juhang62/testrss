<description>&lt;p class=&quot;blog-post-meta&quot;&gt;Monday, September 7th, 2020 by arvid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-496 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo-color-text.png&quot; alt=&quot;libtorrent logo&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo-color-text.png 400w, https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo-color-text-300x70.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;libtorrent-2.0 has just been released with a few major new features. One of them is support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html&quot;&gt;BitTorrent v2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the specification &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bittorrent/bittorrent.org/pull/59&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0052.html&quot;&gt;BEP 52&lt;/a&gt; was done by the8472. The libtorrent support for bittorrent v2 was mostly implemented by Steven Siloti. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biglybt.com&quot;&gt;BiglyBT&lt;/a&gt; also has an implementation of BitTorrent v2 to be released in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BitTorrent v2 kick-started with an effort to transition away from SHA-1 as the hash function for pieces, shortly after google &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; having produced a collision. Given a new hash function would not be backwards compatible, a few other changes were proposed as well, while we were taking the compatibility hit anyway. This post describes the new features of the BitTorrent v2 protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SHA-256&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hash function for piece data was changed to SHA-256. One consequence of this is that hashes are 32 bytes instead of 20 bytes. In BitTorrent v2, the info-dictionary is also computed by SHA-256, which poses a compatibility challenge with the DHT and trackers, which have protocols that expect 20 byte hashes. To handle this, DHT- and tracker announces and lookups for v2 torrents use the SHA-256 info-hash truncated to 20 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the original rationales for creating a v2 protocol to begin with. It means that fundamentally a v2 torrent will be identified by a different hash than a v1 torrent, which would always create a separate swarm, even when sharing the same files. More on this later, under backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;hash trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BitTorrent v1, pieces are hashed and the resulting hashes are included in the .torrent file/metadata (in the info-dictionary). In most cases, the piece hashes is the bulk of the size of .torrent files. To keep the .torrent file size within reason for large files, the piece size can be increased, meaning each hash represents a larger portion of the file. A consequence of large piece sizes is that if a hash fails, one has to re-download a larger portion of the file, until the piece passes the hash check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0030.html&quot;&gt;old idea&lt;/a&gt; to improve both of these metrics is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree&quot;&gt;merkle hash trees&lt;/a&gt; to represent the piece hashes (originally implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tribler.org/&quot;&gt;tribler&lt;/a&gt;). This keeps .torrent files small because all you need is the root hash of the tree. BitTorrent v2 uses merkle hash trees for pieces (but a different protocol that the one tribler implemented). This has the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The torrent metadata (specifically the info-dictionary portion of a .torrent file) becomes a lot smaller. This shaves off start-up latency when adding a magnet link, since fewer bytes need to be downloaded before the torrent download itself can start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded data can be validated on a block level. Meaning if a peer sends corrupt data, it can be discovered immediately and only 16 kiB need to be re-downloaded. The peer that sent the corrupt data can also be identified with certainty. This is a great improvement over the heuristics necessary to identify the bad peer in v1, sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.libtorrent.org/2011/11/smart-ban/&quot;&gt;smart-ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaves of the hash trees are always 16 kiB (the block size), regardless of the piece size. The concept of piece size still exists and is still used in the peer-wire protocol as it is today. e.g. in HAVE and REQUEST messages. However, instead of piece hashes actually being the hash of the content of the piece, it’s the root of the hash tree of the piece. i.e. a sub-tree of the full merkle tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In v2, the .torrent file must still contain these piece hashes (really the hashes in the merkle tree representing the piece-level). This helps distributing and storing the hashes so they don’t have to be recomputed when restarting a client that’s seeding. They’re also stored in the resume state. The .torrent file size is not smaller for a v2 torrent, since it still contains the piece hashes, but the info-dictionary is, which is the part needed for magnet links to start downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_506&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-506&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-506&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/merkle-hash-tree.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/merkle-hash-tree.png 766w, https://blog.libtorrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/merkle-hash-tree-300x110.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-506&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Example tree for a file with 4 blocks and a piece size of 32 kiB (2 blocks per piece)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;per-file hash trees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BitTorrent v2 not only uses a hash tree, but it forms a hash tree for &lt;em&gt;every file&lt;/em&gt; in the torrent. This has a few advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identical files will always have the same hash and can more easily be moved from one torrent to another (when creating torrents) without having to re-hash anything. Files that are identical can also more easily be identified across different swarms, since their root hash only depends on the content of the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All files will be aligned to pieces, which means there are implicit pad files after each file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This addresses a long-standing wish to more easily identify duplicate files, or finding multiple sources for files, across swarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;directory structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, most of the time the piece-hashes take up the majority of space in the info-dictionary. The exceptions are torrents with a lot of small files; then it’s the file list that use the most space. In v1 torrents, file lists are expressed as a single list of files with full paths. In a torrent with a deep directory structure (or just directories with long names), those directory names will be duplicated multiple time, exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v2 torrents address this by using a more efficient encoding for the directory structure, with less duplication. Instead of a flat list, the directory structure is stored as a tree (using bencoded dictionaries). This results in directory names only being mentioned once. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
'files': [
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 12323346, 'path': [ 'F' ] },
    { 'attr': 'p', 'length': 62958, 'path': [ '.pad', '62958' ] },
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 2567, 'path': [ 'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents', 'A' ] },
    { 'attr': 'p', 'length': 62969, 'path': [ '.pad', '62969' ] },
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 14515845, 'path': [ 'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents', 'B' ] },
    { 'attr': 'p', 'length': 33147, 'path': [ '.pad', '33147' ] },
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 912052, 'path': [ 'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents', 'C' ] },
    { 'attr': 'p', 'length': 5452, 'path': [ '.pad', '5452' ] },
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 1330332, 'path': [ 'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents', 'D' ] },
    { 'attr': 'p', 'length': 45924, 'path': [ '.pad', '45924' ] },
    { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 2529209, 'path': [ 'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents', 'E' ] }
    ],
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the v2 file tree (this also includes the merkle tree root hashes):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
'file tree': {
    'F': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 12323346, 'pieces root': 'd1dca3b4a65568b6d62ef2f62d21fcdb676099797c8aa3e092aa0adcb9a9f6a5' } },
    'this is a very long directory name that ends up being duplicated a lot of times in v1 torrents': {
      'A': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 2567, 'pieces root': 'f6e5b48ebc00d7c6351aafdec9a0fa40ab9c8effe8ac6cfb565df070d9532f70' } },
      'B': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 14515845, 'pieces root': '271d61e521401cfb332110aa472dae5f0d49209036eb394e5cf8a108f2d3fb03' } },
      'C': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 912052, 'pieces root': 'd66919d15e1d90ead86302c9a1ee9ef73b446be261d65b8d8d78c589ae04cdc0' } },
      'D': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 1330332, 'pieces root': '202e6b10310d5aae83261d8ee4459939715186cd9f43336f37ca5571ab4b9628' } },
      'E': { '': { 'attr': 'x', 'length': 2529209, 'pieces root': '9cc7c9c9319a80c807eeefb885dff5f49fe7bf5fba6a6fc3ffee5d5898eb5fdb' } }
      }
    },
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;piece size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In v1 torrents, the size of a piece is not restricted by the specification. It doesn’t make much sense to have a piece smaller than the &lt;em&gt;block size&lt;/em&gt; of 16 kiB, but it’s not disallowed. The vast majority of torrents that are created use a power-of-two piece size, but there are a few outliers that are not, but still divisible by 16 kiB. v2 torrents tightens up the requirements of piece sizes by requiring them to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a power of two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greater than or equal to 16 kiB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this is for piece hashes to fit in the hash trees. Since the v2 piece hashes really are the merkle hash tree root of the piece, it must represent a power-of-two number of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;encoding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A .torrent file is a tree structure encoded with bencoding. In bencoding there are a few cases of single values with multiple possible encodings. An integer could be encoded with leading zeros or not, 0 could be encoded as negative 0. Those encodings have always been illegal, but parsers have historically been lenient and accepted them. Perhaps the most common example is how the keys in dictionaries are required to be sorted lexicographically. However, some torrent creators have failed to sort them, so clients have accepted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This primarily causes problems when round-tripping a bencoded structure. Once parsed, the specific order of dictionary entries, or the specific number of leading zeroes may be lost. So when re-encoding the structure, it may be different. If the dictionary that’s being round-tripped is the info-dictionary, the info-hash has changed and things will break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;libtorrent is now enforcing these restrictions by refusing to load any v2 torrent containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an integer with any leading zeros (except 0 itself). e.g. &lt;strong&gt;“i0004e”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 0 encoded as -0. i.e. &lt;strong&gt;“i-0e”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dictionary where the entries are not sorted correctly. e.g. &lt;strong&gt;“d1:B3:foo1:A3:bare”&lt;/strong&gt; (“A” should be sorted before “B”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enforcing these encodings also help make it more likely that two people creating a torrent from the same files, end up with the same info-hash and the same torrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;magnet links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnet link protocol has been extended to support v2 torrents. Like the &lt;strong&gt;urn:btih:&lt;/strong&gt; prefix for v1 SHA-1 info-hashes, there’s a new prefix, &lt;strong&gt;urn:btmh:&lt;/strong&gt; for full v2 SHA0256 info hashes. For example, a magnet link thus looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;blob-code-inner blob-code-marker&quot; data-code-marker=&quot;+&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;   magnet:?xt=urn:btmh:&amp;lt;tagged-info-hash&amp;gt;&amp;amp;dn=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&amp;amp;tr=&amp;lt;tracker-url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info-hash with the btmh prefix is the v2 info-hash in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/multiformats/multihash&quot;&gt;multi-hash format&lt;/a&gt; encoded in hexadecimal. In practice, this means it will have a two byte prefix of &lt;strong&gt;0x12 0x20&lt;/strong&gt;. It is possible to include &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; a v1 (btih) and v2 (btmh) info-hash in a magnet link, for backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;backwards compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All new features in BitTorrent v2 that are not backwards compatible have been carefully given new names, to allow them to coexist with the v1 counterparts. Hence, it’s possible to create &lt;em&gt;hybrid&lt;/em&gt; torrents. That is, torrents that can participate in both a v1 and a v2 swarm at the same time, serving the same files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hybrid torrent has two info-hashes, one v1 SHA-1 hash one (possibly truncated) SHA-256 hash. This forms two swarms, or a segregated swarm. libtorrent marks peers as supporting v2 or not. This information is also relayed via a new peer exchange (PEX) flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hybrid .torrent file includes both piece hashes as well as the tree root hashes for each file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;testing&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Belarus opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova &amp;#039;snatched from street&amp;#039; in Minsk</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/belarus-opposition-leader-maria-kolesnikova-snatched-from-street-in-minsk-reports</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/belarus-opposition-leader-maria-kolesnikova-snatched-from-street-in-minsk-reports</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Unidentified masked men snatched the leading Belarusian opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova from the street in the centre of the capital, Minsk, on Monday and drove her away in a minivan, witnesses told &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.tut.by/economics/699502.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;local media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova was one of the campaign partners of the opposition candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/svetlana-tikhanovskaya&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Svetlana Tikhanovskaya&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed victory against the long-ruling president, Alexander Lukashenko, in disputed elections on 9 August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova was reportedly seized soon after 10am local time while walking close to Minsk’s national art museum. Three other members of the opposition coordination council have also vanished, in what appears to be a targeted attempt by the authorities to wipe out the protest movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova is the most prominent political figure still inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko’s victory – in a poll widely seen as rigged – has sparked mass protests. On Sunday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/belarus-protests-100000-turn-out-in-minsk-alexander-lukashenko&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;more than 100,000 people marched&lt;/a&gt; on the president’s residence, calling on him to quit. Riot police wearing balaclavas arrested 633 people. Gangs of pro-government thugs beat up protesters on their way home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially a stand-in for her husband, a popular blogger barred from running and jailed by the authorities, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya became the main opposition candidate to the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/belarus-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-unseat-alexander-lukashenko&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;an all-female opposition campaign&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded by herself, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She fled to neighbouring Lithuania in early August, from where she posted a video indicating she had faced an ultimatum involving her family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, in a video appearance before the European parliament’s foreign affairs committee, she vowed that the country’s movement for democratic change would not give up, even in the face of continued intimidation and violence from Lukashenko's regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veronika Tsepkalo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft employee, she was the campaign head for her husband Valery Tsepkalo before he was forced to flee with the couple's children to Moscow before the election. Having campaigned alongside Tikhanovskaya and Kolesnikova, she joined him there on the day of the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a one-day stopover in Belarus, when she says she was threatened with jail, she has remained in exile in Moscow. She told a radio interviewer in early August &quot;I think I can do more being in Moscow, being free, and being able to speak up for Belarus' people to the international community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Kolesnikova&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova had been head of the presidential campaign for another opposition politician, Viktor Babariko, also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/14/belarus-bans-two-opposition-candidates-from-running-in-elections&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;barred from the elections&lt;/a&gt; and jailed by the government. She was the only one of the three women to remain in Belarus in the aftermath of the disputed August election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 7 September, it was reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/belarus-opposition-leader-maria-kolesnikova-snatched-from-street-in-minsk-reports&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;she was abducted by unidentified masked men&lt;/a&gt; from the street in the capital, Minsk. Kolesnikova’s press aide, Anton Rodnenkov, confirmed her abduction to the media, then reportedly vanished himself about 40 minutes later. Kolesnikova had announced on 31 August she was forming a new political party, Together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Was this helpful?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__ack&quot; hidden=&quot;&quot; aria-role=&quot;alert&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;Thank you for your feedback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear who abducted Koselnikova. Her coordination council colleagues who have disappeared include Anton Rodnenkov, Ivan Kravtsov and Maxim Bogretsov. Her press team is also missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the local news website &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.tut.by/economics/699502.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Tut.by&lt;/a&gt;, a woman identified as Anastasia said she spotted Kolesnikova in the street. She said she was about to go up to her and to thank her for her work when she changed her mind, thinking Kolesnikova looked exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: “Then I noticed a dark minivan with the slogan “Svyaz” on the side parked up not far from the museum. I carried on and then heard the sound of a telephone falling on the tarmac. I turned round and saw people in civilian clothes and masks dragging Maria into the van. The phone flew out of her hand. One of them picked it up, jumped into the van and they drove off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her telephone did not answer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.tut.by/economics/699502.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Tut.by reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova’s press aide, Rodnenkov, confirmed her abduction but vanished himself around 40 minutes later, it reported. Kolesnikova’s allies said they were checking the report of her detention. Police in Minsk were cited by Russia’s Interfax news agency as saying they had not detained her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the election, Kolesnikova had joined forces with the opposition presidential candidate Tikhanovskaya who later fled to Lithuania, and with Veronika Tsepkalo, who has also since left the country. Another leading activist, Olga Kovalkova, arrived in Poland on Saturday, saying she had been told she would face arrest if she stayed in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends of Kolesnikova’s believe Belarus’s security forces are behind her abduction. They suspect her fate will be similar to that of Kovalkova, who was taken from a remand centre in Minsk by interior ministry representatives and driven into exile. Other members of the Coordination Council may also be thrown out, they suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was scepticism, however, that Lukashenko’s mafia-style tactics would halt the protests. “They are spontaneous. It’s really a grassroots thing happening in Minsk and all over Belarus. People unite in their local communities. They start their own Telegram chats and discuss where to march next,” one Minsk journalist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person added: “I believe Maria’s kidnapping won’t stop the protests. It will intensify them actually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Belarus opposition figures have accused the EU of failing to respond to Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters. Andrei Sannikov, who stood against Lukashanko in the 2010 presidential election, and was subsequently jailed, said sanctions were urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, central bank figures showed Belarus had burned through nearly a sixth of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, or $1.4bn (£1.06bn), in August, as it fought to prop up its rouble currency during the wave of unrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Veronika Tsepkalo (left), Svetlana Tikhanovskaya (centre), and Maria Kolesnikova display their signature gestures at a press-conference in Minsk in July.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e109034b9c93691a6f969ea8fbe9e564031800d4/0_190_4969_2982/master/4969.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=6d9cbdbd510122a0b5203b6af2638e8e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova had announced on 31 August that she was forming a new political party, Together, with the team of jailed opposition figure Viktor Babariko with whom she had previously worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova, a trained flautist and music teacher, got into politics through running the campaign of another opposition politician, the former banker Viktor Babaryko, who attempted to stand for president against Lukashenko but was jailed and barred from running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tikhanovskaya, an English teacher and translator with no political experience, was unexpectedly allowed to run for president, Kolesnikova and Tsepkalo backed her and spoke alongside her at rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women came up with signature gestures: for Tikhanovskaya a raised fist, for Kolesnikova a heart formed with her fingers, and for Tsepkalo a victory sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolesnikova and other members of Babaryko’s campaign team last month announced the creation of a new opposition party called Together.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At 31, I have just weeks to live. Here&amp;#039;s what I want to pass on</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/07/terminal-cancer-live-cancer-life-death</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/07/terminal-cancer-live-cancer-life-death</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1r9pv9q&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-14sgovv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;t the beginning of April &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/terminal-cancer-lockdown-death&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;I wrote a piece&lt;/a&gt; for the Guardian. If you haven’t read it, the headline pretty much sums it up: “Terminal cancer means I won’t see the other side of lockdown”. Given the pandemic and the announcement of shielding for vulnerable people, I thought I wouldn’t be able to live out my last few months in the way I’d imagined. It seemed like I would be stuck alone, with no light at the end of the tunnel, and without the comfort of friends or family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminal cancer means I won't see the other side of lockdown | Elliot Dallen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;sign-in-gate&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Five months on, I’m still here, but much has changed. Thankfully, the experience wasn’t as bleak as you might think. During the first few weeks of lockdown I found I was floating nicely through the time by staying occupied and upbeat. In many ways, you can’t beat the liberation of being able to wake up when you feel like it, having few plans set in stone and being able to do whatever you want with the time you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Over the past couple of months, though, my energy levels have dropped, and I have started doing less. I look drastically different. I have lost a lot of weight. A 20-minute coughing fit is now part of my morning routine while my chest tries to settle itself. It’s nothing that some steroids, morphine, an iced drink to settle my throat and time spent dry-heaving in front of a bucket won’t eventually sort out, but it can get really distressing – like an intrinsic panic response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;At points I was really struggling. The loneliness of Covid was making me miserable, and I needed company. But my sister came to the rescue at just the right moment. She moved back into our shared flat at the end of June. It made a huge difference, and I don’t know where I would be without her. After months of isolation, having a family member close by changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;At the same time, out of the blue, I was told I was finally suitable for a drug trial that had been dangled in front of me for more than a year. The oncologists made it very clear that this would not be a “magic bullet”, and the goal would be to extend life by a few months. The aim of the treatment would be to stop the cancer stealing all the nutrients and energy my body needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;But I was not in the same good shape I had been in at the beginning of other treatments; I was extremely short of breath, unable to exercise and felt lethargic. And after pinning my hopes on the idea of a drug trial for so long, it took just over a week for it to batter me. My days involved moving from my room to the sofa, feeling like I had flu and struggling with mental fog. Almost immediately I realised I just couldn’t do it. Life for me is about living, not just clocking up the years. And this drug made living almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;I realised I had to finally accept the inevitable: that there was no treatment. I thought this mindset would leave me feeling completely liberated. I was wrong. With nothing left to fight, it really was just a question of waiting. The battle became emotional and mental. It has forced me to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The first three decades of my life were pretty standard. Well, actually they were awesome, and everything was going pretty perfectly with regards to work, health, relationships and friends. I had plans for the future, too: learn some Spanish, see more of central America, and get a bit more out of it with some volunteering too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1nfcn93&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Elliot with his sister at Lulworth Cove, Dorset.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0858aaddebe64867cf831a11719e8d4ce18baf41/0_243_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=445&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9dcd0ea9d8e153bae6d185ae01788071&quot; height=&quot;1958&quot; width=&quot;3264&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;css-nsq509&quot;&gt;Elliot with his sister at Lulworth Cove, Dorset.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Elliot Dallen&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;I imagined settling down in my 30s or 40s with kids, a mortgage and so on. Or maybe I wouldn’t. Maybe my friends’ children would call me Uncle Elliot as their parents gathered in the kitchen looking slightly concerned about their single 45-year-old friend about to set off travelling around Mongolia. Either way, growing older with my mates and living my life to the full was always my ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Of course, the second part of this storyline won’t be written now. It’s a shame I don’t get to see what happens. But everybody dies, and there will always be places and experiences missing from anyone’s life – the world has too much beauty and adventure for one person to see. I will miss marriage or children, blossoming careers and lives moving on. But I’m not alone in my life being cut short, and I think my time has been pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;At this point I should say a word to my friends. Being this ill complicates all relationships. The rut I found myself in a few weeks back hasn’t lifted. I’ve definitely been “feeling the victim” a lot more than usual. My acceptance that my time and energy is now limited comes with the knowledge that I won’t be able to catch you all properly to give our relationships the time and appreciation they deserve. I get so many messages from you all, which often exceed the energy I have to reply. Where I am able to see people, I’d just say keeping me company and being positive is helpful. I want fun, laughter, happiness, joy. I think it’s very possible to have this kind of death – there is likely to be a shadow of sadness hanging over proceedings, but for the most part I want everyone relaxed and to be able to feel the love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Because I know that that moment isn’t too far away. I haven’t asked for a specific prognosis, as I don’t believe there’s much to gain from doing so, but I think it’s a matter of weeks. Medicine has luckily turned this into quite a gentle process. That really does take a lot of the fear away. And I’m hoping impending death now grants me the licence to sound prematurely wise and overly grandiose. Because I’ve had time to think about the things that are really important to me, and I want to share what I’ve discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;First, &lt;em&gt;the importance of gratitude&lt;/em&gt;. During my worst moments – the shock of cancer diagnosis, the mental lows and debilitating symptoms of chemotherapy – it was difficult to picture any future moments of joy, closeness or love. Even so, at those times I found comfort in remembering what I have: an amazing family, the friends I’ve made and times I’ve shared with them, the privilege of the life I’ve had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Second, &lt;em&gt;a life, if lived well, is long enough&lt;/em&gt;. This can mean different things to different people. It might mean travel. I’ve had the good fortune to be able do this, and can confirm that the world is a wonderful place full of moments of awe and amazement – soak up as much as you can. It may mean staying active, as much as possible – the human body is a wonderful thing. You only appreciate this when it starts to fail you. So when you find yourself slipping into autopilot, catch yourself, and take simple pleasure in movement, if you can. Look after your body because it’s the only one you have, and it’s bloody brilliant. Knowing that my life was going to be cut short has also changed my perspective on ageing. Most people assume they will live into old age. I have come to see growing old as a privilege. Nobody should lament getting one year older, another grey hair or a wrinkle. Instead, be pleased that you’ve made it. If you feel like you haven’t made the most of your last year, try to use your next one better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-10khgmf&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1nfcn93&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Elliot in the Philippines.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c30571d883ca17df6706eaaefc08fe3dbb3fbb/0_139_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=b9b8469a57bc16b2c4e01f118a668feb&quot; height=&quot;1229&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;css-nsq509&quot;&gt;Elliot in the Philippines.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Elliot Dallen&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Third, it’s important to let yourself &lt;em&gt;be vulnerable and connect to others&lt;/em&gt;. We live in a society that prizes capability and independence, two things that cancer often slowly strips away from you. This was naturally a very difficult pill to swallow for a healthy, able late-twentysomething male, but having to allow myself to be vulnerable and accept help has given me the best two years of my life, which was pretty inconceivable at the time of diagnosis. Vulnerability has shown me what phenomenal people my sister and parents are – words can’t do justice to how much they have done for me. The same applies to my friends – what better way is there to spend two years than being surrounded regularly and closely by these people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Fourth, &lt;em&gt;do something for others&lt;/em&gt;. Against the backdrop of Covid-19, Black Lives Matter and the desperate attempts of migrants to cross the Channel, my thoughts really turned to those who have not had my privilege – whether that’s by virtue of socioeconomics, ethnicity or the country I was born in. I always try to remind myself of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Fifth, &lt;em&gt;protect the planet&lt;/em&gt; – I can’t leave this off because it’s so important. I’ll be gone soon, but humanity will still be faced with the huge challenge of reducing carbon emissions and saving habitats from destruction. In my time here, I’ve been lucky enough to see some natural wonders and understand how precious they are. Hopefully future generations will be able to say the same. But it will take a massive collective effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;If you asked me what I’d want to leave behind, it would be a new awareness of these things among my friends – and anyone who’ll listen, really. I was astonished by the number of people that responded to my article in April. I now find myself in a position where people are asking me how they can help or what they can do that would make me happy. Apart from the obvious – looking after each other once I’ve gone – I’m going to push for people to give, be that money or time. I’ve already had so many people ask which causes I recommend, and there are loads, but I’d say any that align with the values I’ve sketched out above would have my blessing. Among friends and family there is talk of setting up a small charity in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Despite some very low times, it’s worth repeating that the period since being diagnosed has been made not just bearable but actually fantastic. I’ve had new experiences that haven’t seemed tainted by cancer – and those experiences were, as always, much better shared. In a situation that is pretty new for most of my loved ones and friends (I am yet to meet anyone I grew up with who has had to deal with cancer or a similar chronic illness at my age), it has been amazing watching them all rise to the challenge. I’m not sure if it’s just that I know a high proportion of amazing people (possible) or if most human beings have this capacity for connecting and recognising what’s truly important (very likely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;After the gut-punch of cancer diagnosis, I’ve really struggled to define a purpose for my own life. I found in time this came naturally. Life is for enjoyment. Make of it what you can.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Professor suspended for saying 那个 nà ge</title>

&lt;p&gt;Happenings at USC Marshall School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Full-Time MBA Class of 2021,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest and involvement in the current situation concerning the Class of 2022 and their GSBA-542 experience. This matter is of great importance to all of us. Accordingly, I want to make you aware of the action we are taking. This action is described in the attached email* that was just sent to all students in the Class of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Garrett&lt;br /&gt;Dean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[*see next item below]&lt;span id=&quot;more-48302&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday in your GSBA-542 classes, Professor Greg Patton repeated several times a Chinese word that sounds very similar to a vile racial slur in English. Understandably, this caused great pain and upset among students, and for that I am deeply sorry. It is simply unacceptable for faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students. We must and we will do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Marion Philadelphia, Chair of the Department of Business Communications, will take over teaching the remainder of GSBA-542, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday August 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks and months, I have no higher priority than to work with Vice Dean Sharoni Little, Vice Dean Suh-Pyng Ku and the other members of the Marshall leadership team to identify and redress bias, microaggressions, inequities and all forms of systemic racism associated with anyone’s identity throughout our school. We each must grow and learn always to engage respectfully with one another while fostering and exemplifying the knowledge and skills needed to lead and shape our diverse and global world—such as courage, empathy, compassion, advocacy, collaboration, and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply saddened by this disturbing episode that has caused such anguish and trauma. What happened cannot be undone. But please know that Sharoni, Suh-Pyng and I along with the entire Full-Time MBA Program team are here to support each of you. We welcome the opportunity to have conversations with any of you individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff Garrett&lt;br /&gt;Dean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Patton,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a student from your communication class in last year's term 1. I received an email from the dean regarding your removal from teaching communication class because of your use of the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E9%82%A3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define%3D%25E9%2582%25A3&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1598739217789000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE0fnO6nEv9_xFfGkOTeulD7U6OmA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;那&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E4%B8%AA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define%3D%25E4%25B8%25AA&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1598739217789000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH9xQQ7Eaw-3ueEp9KU0UQ4s0Z3aA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;个&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (nà ge) in Chinese as part of a communication example. I am disgusted with the administration's response and their lack of support of a colleague that did nothing wrong. If students seek to mis-interpret the word as a racial slur and claim their &quot;mental health has been affected&quot;, so be it.  Please know that there are many people that support you and are sick of this hyper-sensitive, McCarthyism-like environment that is being fostered across the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxxxx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video, with transcription, of Prof. Patton pronouncing the Mandarin equivalent of &quot;that, that, that…&quot; as a pause particle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grammatically, &quot;nèige 那个&quot; begins as a demonstrative, but it is frequently attenuated to become a pause particle or filler word.  It is often uttered many times in succession, thus &quot;nèige nèige nèige…&quot;, and people who have a tendency to stutter may get stuck on it for an embarrassingly long time.  Even individuals who are not actually stutterers may have an excessive addiction to such words.  One can also say &quot;zhèige zhèige zhèige… 这个 这个 这个… (this this this…)&quot;.  I've even heard people say &quot;zhèige zhèige zhèige… …nèige nèige nèige…&quot; and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close Chinese relative of mine was fond of filling her speech with empty verbiage like this:  &quot;Zhèige rén zěnme nàme nèige? 这个人怎么那么那个? (how can this person be so [like] that?)&quot;, though she would draw out such sentences and speak them in such a manner — filled with hints and innuendoes — that one might suspect she was actually saying something of grave significance.  She was also given to saying &quot;zhèige zhèige zhèige…&quot; and &quot;…nèige nèige nèige…&quot; — &quot;this this this&quot; and &quot;that that that&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selected readings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pregnancy Test Doom: Doom running on a pregnancy test</title>
<link>https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1302820468819288066</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1302820468819288066</guid>
<description>Yesterday I had a lot of retweets and reddit posts and such for playing Doom on a pregnancy test.
But as I explained then, it wasn't really PLAYING on a pregnancy test, it was just a video being played back, not an interactive game.

Well, now it is. It's Pregnancy Test Doom! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Nrjyq07EVv&quot; data-pre-embedded=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-entity-id=&quot;1302820065012641792&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1302820468819288066/video/1&quot; data-tco-id=&quot;Nrjyq07EVv&quot; class=&quot;twitter_external_link dir-ltr tco-link has-expanded-path&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; data-expanded-path=&quot;/Foone/status/1302820468819288066/video/1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nrjyq07EVv&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Elixir Is Erlang, not Ruby</title>
<link>https://preslav.me/2020/09/06/elixir-is-not-ruby-elixir-is-erlang/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://preslav.me/2020/09/06/elixir-is-not-ruby-elixir-is-erlang/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt; like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt;, because as much as you want it to be, &lt;strong&gt;Elixir is not Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, &lt;strong&gt;Elixir is all about Erlang.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers
&lt;p&gt;Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java,  .NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it. This applies both to when things go well, as well as when they go south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest hope of all is that by understanding Erlang well enough, the Elixir community will start looking for new uses for it. Uses that go beyond being a scalable replacement for Rails apps. More daring and more ambitious uses, where Erlang's resilience model can prove to be critical for the success of the mission. I'd love to see it used in transportation, space, as well as the domain that started it all- telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Noita – roguelite where every pixel is simulated</title>
<link>https://noitagame.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://noitagame.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noita&lt;/strong&gt; is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've crafted yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;one-half column&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel-based physics:&lt;/strong&gt; Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in the blood of your foes!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;one-half column&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your own magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Create new spells as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use your magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;one-half column&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action roguelite:&lt;/strong&gt; Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don’t despair, use what you’ve learned to get further on your next adventure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;one-half column&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedurally generated world:&lt;/strong&gt; Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;55.439728353141&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is Noita going to be available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is available now on Early Access on &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/noita&quot;&gt;Humble Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nollagames.itch.io/noita&quot;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/noita&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Noita coming to platform &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During Early Access we're focused on PC.&lt;br/&gt;After that we might look into porting to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Noita going to be in early access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. It is in early access right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why &quot;Noita&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noita is the Finnish word for &quot;Witch&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does &quot;every pixel is simulated&quot; mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically every pixel in Noita is made of some material. The different materials are simulated. E.g. Water will behave like a liquid, gasses will rise, sand will pile up, rigid bodies will rigid body... In addition to that we run simplified simulations of various chemical reactions, electricity, thermodynamics and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you able to simulate so much stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're using our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://nollagames.com/fallingeverything&quot;&gt;Falling Everything engine&lt;/a&gt;. Falling Everything Engine is an in-house labor of love. A true love child. Handcrafted in the finest C++ without exceptions, using only hand picked, organic, free license libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm a live streamer and/or write reviews. Can I get a free copy of your game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're a streamer, please request a key through &lt;a href=&quot;https://embed.keymailer.co/g/games/63348&quot;&gt;Keymailer&lt;/a&gt;. Our general policy is that we give keys to streamers who have got at least 1000 followers (can twitch, youtube, mixer or even twitter followers). Or in other cases you can us email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@nollagames.com&quot;&gt;press@nollagames.com&lt;/a&gt; and we'll let you know when the game is available for previews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would like to do an internship at your studio. Is that possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're a very small team and have to keep our priorities in check. We don't normally take interns.

<title>The Right to Repair could help address a critical shortage in school computers</title>
<link>https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/right-repair-could-help-address-critical-shortage-school-computers#new_tab</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/right-repair-could-help-address-critical-shortage-school-computers#new_tab</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In many places across the United States, school has begun, with much of that schooling actually remote learning. We’ve found out we have a big problem: There are not enough computers for every student stuck at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to an AP investigation, America is some &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/01e9302796d749b6aadc35ddc8f4c946&quot;&gt;5 million laptops short&lt;/a&gt; of what we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Whether or not you or your child can access a computer and the internet could mean the difference between getting an education this fall, or not. The stakes have perhaps never been higher for equitable computer access in the U.S. But thanks to disruptions in the supply chain, even though schools and businesses have ordered new computers, they aren’t showing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;California is short &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article244418057.html&quot;&gt;1 million computers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/20/denver-public-schools-computer-shortage-covid/&quot;&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;’s public schools are lacking thousands of computers, while waiting for orders to be fulfilled. Delays are threatening remote learning for school districts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kolotv.com/2020/08/21/laptop-shortage-an-issue-for-wcsd-in-turning-to-distance-learning/&quot;&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2020/08/01/st-landry-parish-board-members-question-virtual-reopening-schools/5549317002/&quot;&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. All across the country, schools are scrambling, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.savannahnow.com/news/20200817/savannah-public-schools-will-be-thousands-short-of-its-order-of-computer-dhttps://www.savannahnow.com/news/20200817/savannah-public-schools-will-be-thousands-short-of-its-order-of-computer-devices-when-classes-startevices-when-classes-start&quot;&gt;Savannah&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kvue.com/article/news/education/schools/austin-isd-chromebooks-ipads-delay-2020-fall/269-c0016959-618c-43ce-ad70-968e1d8dbf15&quot;&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample of results from an exclusive Associated Press report on school computer shortages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&quot;Sales have been up 20 percent to 40 percent every single week,&quot; Stephen Baker, a consumer tech analyst with The NPD Group, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-education-laptop-shortage-f5990485-6277-4f4e-a37c-ec7f77d68241.html&quot;&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Refurbished computers meet critical need&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We likely already have all the computers we need to meet this shortfall. While new computers are hard to find, there is another solution: collecting, refurbishing and distributing computers that no one is using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Given that Americans bought 48 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/722361/united-states-mobile-pc-unit-shipments/&quot;&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt; and 17 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/722354/united-states-desktop-pc-unit-shipments/&quot;&gt;desktops&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and that globally, the combined production of laptops, desktops and tablets has been fairly steady for the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/272595/global-shipments-forecast-for-tablets-laptops-and-desktop-pcs/&quot;&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt;, there are more than enough devices, especially if you add in tablets. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple refurbisher John Bumstead believes restoring activtation locked tablets could address the shortfall. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We have a majority of what we need,” said TechDump CEO Amanda LaGrange, citing that businesses and households often retire “outdated” computers to the back of their closets when they can easily be fixed and updated. In any case, if a PC or laptop is unredeemable, refurbishers can extract the parts they need for other repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our problem is that while the production and shipment of new computers is, under normal circumstances, streamlined, the same can’t be said for how we treat reuse and refurbishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;According to goTRG CEO Sender Shamiss, refurbishing is critical, but the lack of trust between manufacturers and refurbishers makes it difficult to establish a line of communication. More often than not, manufacturers malign independent refurbishers as inferior even though the independent evaluators have determined that the quality of their repair is comparable to that of authorized refurbishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Almost everything is refurbished by third parties,” said Shamiss. “There is no difference between an authorized refurbisher and a non-authorized refurbisher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Robin Ingenthron, founder of Good Point Recycling says that manufacturers create obstacles with the devices themselves to dissuade the reuse of  tech products. “Technology may auto-lock (“brick”) devices sold to second-hand and third-hand consumers,” explained Ingenthron at an event about reusing products, hosted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Reuse helps meet shortfalls&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;All across the country, refurbishers are stepping in to fill the gaps. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news/remote-learning-needs-computers/&quot;&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, a local non-profit called NERDit NOW is providing low-cost computers to students in partnership with local schools, and has ramped up its local operation. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/nonprofit-works-to-supply-students-with-refurbished-laptops&quot;&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, New Life Tech Group, which normally refurbishes and donates 50 computers each year, ramped up its workflow and gave away more than 2,000. Both non-profits note that it costs about $50 to refurbish one laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Necessity is the mother of invention.Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwcs.edu/news/2019-20_news/p_w_c_s_students_distribute_refurbished_computers&quot;&gt;high school students&lt;/a&gt; started their own refurbishing program in Virginia, and as did an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsherald.com/story/news/2020/08/10/panama-city-man-refurbishes-laptops-bay-county-students-need/3317716001/&quot;&gt;engineer in Florida&lt;/a&gt; to address the needs in their respective communities. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, a local television station is running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/outreach/3cares/computers-for-kids-drive-rolls-into-its-second-week/95-132c9dad-fc08-49c7-abeb-4da6c06b781a&quot;&gt;used computer drive&lt;/a&gt; to collect and refurbish devices for students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most of these community-refurbished computers are going directly to families, and not through the school system, explained Erez Pikar, the CEO of Toxell-CDI, one of the larger computer refurbishers. “Schools don’t have enough IT staff,” explained Pikar to U.S. PIRG, and therefore can’t support too many dissimilar devices. The best products for schools to use are refurbished business computers which tend to come in lot sizes big enough to give each student the same computer. Unfortunately, according to Pikar, businesses have been reluctant to send computers to refurbishers over the last few months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Right to Repair reforms would lower barriers for critical computer refurbishing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even as refurbished computers are more and more mission critical, many barriers remain to getting them into the hands of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Many usable computers are sitting in corporate overstock or empty offices, and perhaps even in your basement. But even when refurbishers get those computers, they can’t always get them working because manufacturers restrict access to spare parts or manuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;LaGrange and other refurbishers describe bins of activation-locked devices in their facilities -- devices that work fine, but are locked down because the original owner forgot to unlock her account when she donated or sold it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’d have a lot more computers available if the industry as a whole valued reuse and the secondary life of electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;According to LaGrange, manufacturers should use this as an opportunity to evaluate their positions regarding the right to repair and how lower barriers to repair could help address the digital divide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“This would all be a lot easier if we had right to repair,” said LaGrange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
