<title>SQL databases come up with algorithms you’d never have dreamed of (2017) [video]</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;SQL is the only ever successful, mainstream, and general-purpose 4GL (Fourth Generation Programming Language) and it is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With modern cost based optimisation, relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL finally keep up to the promise of a powerful declarative programming model by adapting to ever changing productive data without performance penalties. Thousand-line-long, complex SQL statements can be run in far below a millisecond against billion-row strong tables if database developers know their ways around the SQL language - and the best news is: It's not that hard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show how the SQL database will constantly outperform any hand written data retrieval algorithm - or in other words - how SQL, being a logic language, is the best language for business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quirk – Open-Source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</title>
<link>https://github.com/flaque/quirk</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/flaque/quirk</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quirk-cbt/id1447026451?mt=8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download iOS&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.econn.quirk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download Android&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:humans@usequirk.com&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;https://timeline.noticeable.io/Eg17gkp9Nga9OcrvjToA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirk is a crossplatform, GPL-licensed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)&lt;/a&gt; app built in React Native / Expo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about your mood or ask you to depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5942769/54972305-4081d180-4f48-11e9-91d8-7e8117668418.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5942769/54972305-4081d180-4f48-11e9-91d8-7e8117668418.gif&quot; alt=&quot;quirk screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirk is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;node&lt;/a&gt; installed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt; is preferred over NPM as a package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; clone the project and cd into it&lt;/span&gt;
git clone git@github.com:Flaque/quirk.git&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ./quirk

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; install dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
yarn

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; start development environment&lt;/span&gt;
yarn start
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll then be in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expo development environment&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have XCode installed with a simulator, you can just press &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to start it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirk's goal is to be both inviting and focused. It should be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy to enter in a thought; people frequently enter these in public settings and need to do it fairly quickly. It also should not cause any increased frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design Logic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qurik is built with two main goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't be bloated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be evil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don't be bloated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include features for one particular condition at the expense of other conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, don't couple mood tracking to thought tracking. If a user &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to enter a mood in order to track a thought, then the entire app is ruined for people who use it for panic, OCD or another condition where mood isn't the primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include non-CBT related treatments without good reason.&lt;/strong&gt; No relaxation audio tracks or meditation guides. It's a CBT app, keep it focused on CBT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't include things that could be better acomplished by another app.&lt;/strong&gt; No one needs an in-app diary when a diary works just fine. No one needs an in-app heart rate tracker when a heart rate tracker works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be quick and efficent.&lt;/strong&gt; Thoughts shouldn't take 5 minutes to enter and you should be able to skip fields if it's reasonable. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't be Evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.&lt;/strong&gt; Most people would rather give over their passwords than their CBT thoughts. They're incredibly private, occasionally involve other people, and frequently are embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't have $200 dollar in app purchases.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm looking at you CBT Thought Diary. I get it, developers need to make money. It costs a lot to just keep the app on the app store. But you're preying on vulnerable people. Very few people of rational mind will purposely spend $200s for a dark mode. Gimme a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't have dumb notifications.&lt;/strong&gt; Scheduling is fine, abusing push notifications so your app has better traffic is scummy and gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be open.&lt;/strong&gt; Not every app has to be open source; it's a hard choice to make. But be clear and obvious within the app about what's going on with the user's data. Don't be sending it to some server without making that clear within the app, not within some dumb privacy policy no one will ever read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't push people to be unhappy.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot believe I have to state this, but do not purposefully or accidentally force people to be unhappy to use their app. Don't force people to state their unhappy in order to access a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.&lt;/strong&gt; User engagement is fine to be concerned about. We all want people who need help to be actually engaging in the help. But holy moly becareful about this. You &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want to drive something that is for many people a treatment into a self-perpetuating engagement loop. A ruthless focus on engagement has caused many a product to become skinner boxes. &lt;em&gt;No one should ever be addicted to your mental health app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quirk &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;/em&gt; lose user data. The entire point of the app is to record your thoughts, so if you lost them it would be pretty bad. As stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010839/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an app failure in general can be inconvenient and annoying, it can have serious consequences in the context of mental health apps—someone who has come to rely on an app for emotional support can find a failure “devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, data management should be given a higher priority than any other part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxonomy and Order of Data Failure Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of extremely &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; behaviors and states that could happen in order of severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1 - Large Scale Data Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thoughts have been corrupted somehow. For example, the JSON format of every item is wrong. This is put at the top because not only can a user not access the data, but it may spiral out can cause continuing errors forcing the app to be &quot;bricked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 - Large Scale Data Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thoughts have been deleted without any hope of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3 - Small Scale Data Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small amount of data has been deleted without any hope of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4 - Small Scale Data Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small amount of data has been corrupted in a recoverable way. The user still has lost data, but the app does not crash, and this is potentially fixable via an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 7:50 a.m. ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain Motel 6 has agreed to pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the state of Washington after several locations gave information on thousands of guests to Immigration and Customs Enforcement without warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Thursday that Motel 6 shared the information of about 80,000 guests in the state from 2015 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led to targeted investigations of guests with Latino-sounding names, according to Ferguson. He said many guests faced questioning from ICE, detainment or deportation as a result of the disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the second settlement over the company's practice in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motel 6 also has signed a legally binding &lt;a href=&quot;https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/ConsentDecreeMotel6.pdf&quot;&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; to no longer share guest information without a warrant at any of its locations nationwide, a practice the chain says it has already ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,&quot; Ferguson said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-motel-6-will-pay-12m-violating-privacy-tens-thousands-washingtonians&quot;&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Our resolution holds Motel 6 accountable for illegally handing over guests' private information without a warrant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company told NPR in an emailed statement that, as part of the agreement, it would &quot;continue to enforce its guest privacy policy, which prohibits the sharing of guest information except in cases where a judicially enforceable warrant or subpoena is present, or local law requires this information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company has also implemented a system of additional controls to ensure corporate oversight and compliance in cases where law enforcement requests are made.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/motel-6-calling-ice-undocumented-guests-phoenix-immigration-lawyers-9683244&quot;&gt;The Phoenix New Times&lt;/a&gt; first uncovered the practice in September 2017 when reporter Antonia Farzan investigated two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We got a tip that this was happening, started talking to local immigration attorneys and definitely kept hearing from people that this was a trend,&quot; Farzan told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2017/09/15/551339907/motel-6-locations-in-phoenix-share-guest-lists-with-ice-agents&quot;&gt;NPR's Ari Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; at the time. &quot;They didn't really know what was behind it but that they kept seeing people get picked up at Motel 6.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following initial media reports, Motel 6 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/motel6/status/908453005296619521&quot;&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the practice had been discontinued and that it would issue a directive to each of its locations to clarify &quot;that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE.&quot; The hotel said at the time that the practice was implemented &quot;at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/04/575567251/motel-6-gave-guest-information-to-immigration-agents-lawsuit-says&quot;&gt;sued the company&lt;/a&gt; a few months later, alleging employees at seven locations in the Puget Sound region violated state consumer-protection law when they also released guest information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson said at the time that the hotels would turn over entire guest lists to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to our interviews with employees at Motel 6,&quot; he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/01/06/576197682/washington-state-sues-motel-6-over-sharing-guest-immigration-data&quot;&gt;told NPR's Scott Simon&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;ICE agents would circle the names that looked Latino-sounding and ran those names through a database and then would detain individuals based on those random checks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement from Ferguson about Thursday's settlement detailed several cases of guests whose names were provided to ICE, including one Seattle man who stayed at a Motel 6 near Sea-Tac for one night, wrapping Christmas presents for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;ICE agents approached him in the hotel's parking lot, detained him and deported him some days later,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;The man was the sole provider for the household, and his wife is currently struggling to support their toddler and four other children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motel 6 has agreed to also train its employees not to release guest information improperly and maintain a 24-hour hotline to help employees when they receive requests for information. The company will also be required to create a tool on its website for guests to report possible violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state says more than $10 million of the settlement fund will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atg.wa.gov/motel-6-settlement-claim-information&quot;&gt;paid out&lt;/a&gt; to affected guests — including those who did not have any contact with ICE after their information was disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Motel 6 settled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665833059/motel-6-agrees-to-pay-7-6-million-to-former-guests-to-settle-lawsuit&quot;&gt;a separate lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in Arizona by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

<title>Battery Power&amp;#039;s Latest Plunge in Costs Threatens Coal, Gas</title>
<link>https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;London and New York, March 26, 2019&lt;/em&gt; – Two technologies that were immature and expensive only a few years ago but are now at the center of the unfolding low-carbon energy transition have seen spectacular gains in cost-competitiveness in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest analysis by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF) shows that the benchmark levelized cost of electricity,&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-powers-latest-plunge-costs-threatens-coal-gas/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or LCOE, for lithium-ion batteries has fallen 35% to $187 per megawatt-hour since the first half of 2018. Meanwhile, the benchmark LCOE for offshore wind has tumbled by 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onshore wind and photovoltaic solar have also gotten cheaper, their respective benchmark LCOE reaching $50 and $57 per megawatt-hour for projects starting construction in early 2019, down 10% and 18% on the equivalent figures of a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Giannakopoulou, head of energy economics at BNEF, commented: “Looking back over this decade, there have been staggering improvements in the cost-competitiveness of these low-carbon options, thanks to technology innovation, economies of scale, stiff price competition and manufacturing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis shows that the LCOE per megawatt-hour for onshore wind, solar PV and offshore wind have fallen by 49%, 84% and 56% respectively since 2010. That for lithium-ion battery storage has dropped by 76% since 2012, based on recent project costs and historical battery pack prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking finding in this LCOE Update, for the first-half of 2019, is on the cost improvements in lithium-ion batteries. These are opening up new opportunities for them to balance a renewables-heavy generation mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries co-located with solar or wind projects are starting to compete, in many markets and without subsidy, with coal- and gas-fired generation for the provision of ‘dispatchable power’ that can be delivered whenever the grid needs it (as opposed to only when the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity demand is subject to pronounced peaks and lows inter-day. Meeting the peaks has previously been the preserve of technologies such as open-cycle gas turbines and gas reciprocating engines, but these are now facing competition from batteries with anything from one to four hours of energy storage, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tifenn Brandily, energy economics analyst at BNEF, said: “Solar PV and onshore wind have won the race to be the cheapest sources of new ‘bulk generation’ in most countries, but the encroachment of clean technologies is now going well beyond that, threatening the balancing role that gas-fired plant operators, in particular, have been hoping to play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore wind has often been seen as a relatively expensive generation option compared to onshore wind or solar PV. However, auction programs for new capacity, combined with much larger turbines, have produced sharp reductions in capital costs, taking BNEF’s global benchmark for this technology below $100 per MWh, compared to more than $220 just five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannakopoulou said: “The low prices promised by offshore wind tenders throughout Europe are now materializing, with several high-profile projects reaching financial close in recent months. Its cost decline in the last six months is the sharpest we have seen for any technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the LCOE of solar PV has fallen 18% in the last year, the great majority of that decline happened in the third quarter of 2018, when a shift in Chinese policy caused there to be a huge global supply glut of modules, rather than over the most recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNEF’s LCOE analysis is based on information on real projects starting construction and proprietary pricing information from suppliers. Its database covers nearly 7,000 projects across 20 technologies (including the various types of coal, gas and nuclear generation as well as renewables), situated in 46 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Computer Graphics from Scratch (2017)</title>
<link>http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; This book will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Graphics from scratch&lt;/strong&gt; is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence &lt;strong&gt;“from scratch”&lt;/strong&gt;. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is divided in two main parts, &lt;strong&gt;Raytracing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rasterization&lt;/strong&gt;, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The &lt;strong&gt;Common concepts&lt;/strong&gt; chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, &lt;em&gt;sample code&lt;/em&gt;, written in the most &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt; way possible, which may not be the most &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt; way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strenghts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a &lt;code&gt;canvas&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-read-this&quot;&gt;Why read this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot; readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaders&lt;/strong&gt;. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun&lt;/strong&gt;. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-in-progress&quot;&gt;Work in progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Texture filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textures in the raytracer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection in the rasterizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra appendix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make demos interactive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up demo code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contribute or to correct mistakes - all the text, diagrams and demos are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. PRs welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-author&quot;&gt;About the author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer who founded and ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysterystudio.com&quot;&gt;game development company&lt;/a&gt; (which you haven’t heard of), worked at Google (which you have heard of), and now works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://improbable.io&quot;&gt;Improbable&lt;/a&gt; (who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real - or at the very least revolutionise multiplayer game development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught Computer Graphics for 5 years at my university, where it was a semester-long 3rd year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that have inspired this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other interests besides Computer Graphics, engineering-related and otherwise. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://gabrielgambetta.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; for more details and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;m Joining CloudFlare</title>
<link>https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-04-05&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;April 5, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/jpH1brqXUvSAz1tNQ8uVKb0xspap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/jpH1brqXUvSAz1tNQ8uVKb0xspap_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloudflare logo.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I signed an offer letter from Cloudflare. I’ll be the product manager of Storage, which is the part of the company that’s working on data storage products for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;/a&gt; platform. I’ll be starting at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of you will say “that makes perfect sense,” but many more will say “wait, what?”. I hope this post will make things a bit more clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, I also want to say that I’ll still be continuing my work on Rust, though obviously in a more limited capacity. I’ll still be working on revisions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/&quot;&gt;The Rust Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;, and doing core team work, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I worked on Rust, I worked on and with Ruby on Rails. When I got out of the web application game, the hot topic was this new “platform as a service” stuff. I’ve been watching all of the latest changes from afar, and they’ve been quite interesting. I’ve always loved the web, and the people building it. In the last 18 months or so, I’ve also been extremely interested in WebAssembly. Working at Cloudflare is the intersection of four things for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edge compute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal and career growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;edge-compute_2&quot;&gt;Edge Compute &lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare#edge-compute_2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s sort of been four eras of “how do I web server”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical servers (“on premise”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people see the relationship between these things as “what you control” vs “what does the provider control”, but I don’t think that’s quite right. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, if you wanted a web site, you bought a physical server, and you put it in a data center somewhere. I wasn’t around for those days. The point is, you managed everything: the hardware, the software. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/305-CloudFab-Distributed-Fabrication-3D-printing,-Nick-Pinkston-interview.html&quot;&gt;my days as a startup CTO&lt;/a&gt;, my services were deployed to a Virtual Private Server. Instead of owning servers ourselves, we rented a virtual machine, running on someone else’s servers. This is “infrastructure as a service”; I didn’t have to worry about machines, I could just ask for one, and it’d be given to me. I still had to manage the operating system and everything above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun side note: CloudFab was a Rails application with a big C extension to do data processing that was too much for Ruby. This later informed a lot of my Rust work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up came “platform as a service.” To me, Heroku was the platonic ideal of this era. Now, you didn’t even need to manage servers. You got to worry about your application, and that’s it. Maybe you’d need to set a slider to scale during times of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading a lot about “functions as a service” over the past few years. Instead of deploying an entire application, each endpoint becomes an application, basically. This is where I think the previous thinking about the relationships between these categories of service is a little wrong. The actual underlying trend here is something else: what affordances do I have to scale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the on-premise days, if I wanted to add capacity, I’d need to buy new servers, install them, set everything up. There’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of latency there. And if I need to remove capacity, well, I have to sell those servers? The move to infrastructure as a service was significant, because it more clearly separated concerns. Each company didn’t need a data center; a data center provides homogeneous compute. As a user, if I need to scale, I can spin up some more virtual servers much more quickly than I can physical ones. Managing that required a lot of tooling, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the insight that led to platform as a service: by managing this tooling, you could make it even easier for users to scale. There’s a reason why the slider became the ubiquitous synonym with PaaS. There’s nothing that you could do with PaaS that was impossible with IaaS, but it was much, much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to Functions as a Service, also known as “serverless.” The reason that this architecture matters is one very similar to previous insights. By breaking your application into multiple functions, they can scale independently. This is one of the dreams of microservice architecture, but there’s a bit of a difference. Microservice architecture focuses on how you build your system, and how you split up components internally. FaaS focuses on how people interact with your system, and splits up the components according to that. This framing is a bit more significant to your ability to scale, because it means that during times of high load, you can scale only the parts under that load. In the same way that IaaS said “let’s not force people to buy servers to scale” and PaaS said “let’s not force people to build out infrastructure to scale”, FaaS says “let’s not force people to scale their help page to scale their shopping cart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to edge compute. Edge compute is a particular kind of FaaS, but an interesting take on it. Here’s the concept: your users are all over the world. Why do their packets need to go to &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt; and back? To which you might say, “sure, that’s why we’ve developed our application to work in multiple regions.” That’s the same relationship between IaaS and PaaS. That is, why should you have to worry about making your application be available across multiple regions? You may not be worrying about individual physical servers anymore, but you’re still worrying about data centers. And some FaaS products, like AWS Lambda, can already run easily across multiple regions, and with some setup, go between them. However, Amazon has about 20 total regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is edge compute different? Well, at some point, various CDN companies realized “wait a minute. We have severs around the world. Why can’t we run compute on them as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Cloudflare is not really a CDN company, though that’s how I always thought of them. They do a lot more stuff than CDNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because, well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;here’s those 20 Amazon regions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/qxGa9h6TshtRrXZmh6tsRU0xspap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/qxGa9h6TshtRrXZmh6tsRU0xspap_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;awsregions.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/network-map&quot;&gt;Fastly’s network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/ePzMAv7Q4NVLARUKambWH80xspap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/ePzMAv7Q4NVLARUKambWH80xspap_small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;map_POP.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/network/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/bQzn9XqBY98mw269Q1tsdH0xspap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/bQzn9XqBY98mw269Q1tsdH0xspap_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;cloudflarenetwork.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the page is animated, so those highlighted ones don’t mean anything)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re much likely to be physically closer to a Fastly or Cloudflare server than you are an AWS one. And that’s what we mean by “edge compute”, that is, you’re running your code on the edge, rather than in the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I should also mention that there is a form of Lambda called Lambda@Edge that runs off of CloudFront locations, rather than the above map. So that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/vwJvtVvGK7DpGZYEPcrjzW0xspap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://svbtleusercontent.com/vwJvtVvGK7DpGZYEPcrjzW0xspap_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;cloudfront.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better! My point about regions is more applicable to “edge compute” vs more general compute, than saying something about Lambda as a particular product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFlare Workers don’t require you to think about where your service is deployed: when you upload it, it’s automatically running on all 175 locations, within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this space is interesting and significant. Cloudflare has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/&quot;&gt;Workers&lt;/a&gt;, and Fastly has &lt;a href=&quot;https://wasm.fastlylabs.com/&quot;&gt;Terrarium&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html&quot;&gt;Lambda@Edge&lt;/a&gt;. These are all very interesting platforms for building high performance applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role as part of Storage will be to consider “what does data access and storage look like in this world?” If your code is moved to the edge, but your data is still in a central server, you don’t gain the full benefit of having the code close to the client. There’s a lot of interesting stuff in this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;webassembly_2&quot;&gt;WebAssembly &lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare#webassembly_2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ClouldFlare Workers and Fastly’s Terrarium use &lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt; as a core part of the platform. And that’s significant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.0778816199377&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn’t have needed to created Docker. That’s how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let’s hope WASI is up to the task! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4&quot;&gt;https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Solomon Hykes (@solomonstre) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this stuff to work, you need a runtime for WebAssembly. One interesting thing we’re seeing in this space is sort of two parallel paths emerge: do you want to support JavaScript, or not? Recently, Fastly open sourced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime&quot;&gt;Lucet&lt;/a&gt;, the WebAssembly runtime that powers Terrarium. It’s an impressive bit of tech. There are others too, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wasmer.io/&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime&quot;&gt;Wasmtime&lt;/a&gt;. By focusing purely on WebAssembly, you can build specialized tech, and it can be really, really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can’t compile JavaScript to WebAssembly. You can sort of do it with AssemblyScript, a TypeScript subset the compiles to wasm. But JavaScript is arguably the most popular programming language in the world. I personally believe in JavaScript, even with the rise of WebAssembly. And so Cloudflare is taking a different approach than those projects. Instead of building a wasm-only runtime, they’re building on top of Google’s V8. This means that they can support both WebAssembly and JavaScript in workers. Additionally, by leaning on V8, you can take advantage of all of the excellent engineering resources that Google pours into it, similar to how the Rust compiler gets to take advantage of people working on improving LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is, WebAssembly is core to this new edge compute world. And so I’m excited to be in the space. I know people that work at Fastly, wasmer, and Mozilla, and they’re all doing great work. I think there’s space for both approaches, but I’m mostly excited to be there and see how it all turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one other thing I wanted to say: right now, everything around Workers is closed source. Kudos to Fastly for open-sourcing Lucet. I asked about this in my interview, and Cloudflare is very interested in doing more open source work, and so I’m hoping it doesn’t take us long to catch up in this regard. We’ll see, of course, I haven’t actually started yet. But I think that this stuff needs to be open source, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust_2&quot;&gt;Rust &lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare#rust_2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may remember a little story called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbleed&quot;&gt;CloudBleed&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Cloudflare had a pretty bad security bug in 2017. This bug happened because of a parser, written in Ragel. Here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/&quot;&gt;I’ll let Cloudflare explain it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ragel code is converted into generated C code which is then compiled. The C code uses, in the classic C manner, pointers to the HTML document being parsed, and Ragel itself gives the user a lot of control of the movement of those pointers. The underlying bug occurs because of a pointer error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudBleed happened due to memory unsafety. When talking to Cloudflare today, it’s pretty clear that this bug was taken extremely seriously, to the point where it created a culture change inside the company itself. These days, it seems to me (I haven’t started yet, mind you) that you have to use a memory safe language by default, and only use a memory unsafe one if you have an extremely good justification. But Cloudflare needs to be able to have a lot of performance, and control latency, in much of their stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Rust. Cloudflare started exploring Rust after CloudBleed, and now uses a significant amount of Rust in production. They host the local Rust meetup here in Austin, and sometimes the one in San Francisco. I’m excited to help Cloudflare be successful with Rust, and to use that experience to help improve Rust too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that I’ll be dealing with a bunch of TypeScript and possibly Go as well, which is also pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;career-growth_2&quot;&gt;Career growth &lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare#career-growth_2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the move to product management. I really enjoy product work, and have had several jobs that were sorta-kinda product jobs. I don’t think that management jobs are inherently better than engineer jobs, of course, but it’s a way for me to grow. My role at Balanced was sorta-kinda-PM-y, and I loved that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have too much more to say about this, just that it’s a bit different, but something I’m really excited to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i39m-excited-for-the-future_2&quot;&gt;I’m excited for the future &lt;a class=&quot;head_anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/i-m-joining-cloudflare#i39m-excited-for-the-future_2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that’s my extremely long-winded explanation of what’s going on. I’m not starting until the end of the month, so I’ve got a few weeks to purely enjoy. I’ll still be playing a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celestegame.com/&quot;&gt;Celeste&lt;/a&gt; and Fortnite, writing blog posts, and working on some Rust open source. But then I get to get back to work. I’m pumped about all of this! New role, building some new tech with tech I already love.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;649&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;649&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;The U.S. saw its highest level of layoffs in a first quarter since 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.challengergray.com/press/press-releases/march-2019-job-cuts-report-60587-cuts-add-highest-quarterly-total-q3-2015&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;data from staffing firm Challenger, Gray &amp;amp; Christmas&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Employers cut 190,410 jobs in the first 3 months of the year — 10.3% higher than the number of layoffs announced in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 35.6% higher than job cuts announced in the same quarter of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact:&lt;/strong&gt; It's the highest number of job cuts in a quarter since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The financial industry saw the third highest number of layoffs and the year-to-date total was 239% higher than it was in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Retailers continue to lead all sectors in job cuts this year with 46,061 in Q1. However, that number is 18.5% lower than retail cuts announced in Q1 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Retailers have announced plans to close 4,048 stores so far this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; The report said worry about an economic slowdown was the main driver of companies' layoff intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citybound is a city building game with a focus on realism, collaborative planning and simulation of microscopic details. It is independently developed, open source and funded through Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a living and open document, find out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citybound/citybound/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;how to contribute your suggestions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books/Ideas
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citybound is a game about:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beauty of emergent complexity,&lt;/strong&gt; in the familiar example of a city. (&lt;code&gt;EMERGENCE&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge of understanding &lt;code&gt;INTERDEPENDENT SYSTEMS&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; that form a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experience of &lt;code&gt;PLANNING&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. having a complex idea, developing it, carefully preparing it and making it real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experience of &lt;code&gt;COLLABORATION&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the way humans work together to achieve great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interplay between the &lt;strong&gt;player's conscious action and the cities' organic reaction&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;CITY AS AN ORGANISM&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citybound aspires to:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;INTERACTION BY PAINTING&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. through powerful but simple tools with haptic qualities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLARITY OF CAUSE AND EFFECT&lt;/code&gt;, making patterns of behavior and consequences of one’s actions obvious- in the small and in the large&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cities are built in large continuous regions with several million inhabitants (&lt;code&gt;VASTNESS&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time progresses in &lt;code&gt;OVERLAID TIME-SCALES&lt;/code&gt;: Daily and yearly activities happen at a similar pace. (&lt;code&gt;MULTI-SCALE PHENOMENA&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities consist of persistent &lt;code&gt;UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. people &amp;amp; businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop systems from first principles, with complex behaviors emerging from simple microscopic interactions &lt;code&gt;(emergence)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve problems generally, do not restrict thinking in specialized problem instances &lt;code&gt;(actual problem)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be brave to do things in new ways, where necessary &lt;code&gt;(radicality)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Rust as the main programming language for high performance and a strong type system to rely on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an actor-based model for isolation, dynamic dispatch and simple parallelization and networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Rust &amp;amp; JavaScript combination to implement a cross-platform, WebGL based UI that communicates with a simulation backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hierarchy of Player Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Building a city&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Observation &amp;amp; Inspection&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Planning&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Execution &amp;amp; Finances&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulation core takes care of the progression and scales of in-game time by frequently updating continuous processes as well as sending one-off notifications and timeouts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compressed and overlaid timescales to make the player experience short-term and long-term phenomena at once &lt;code&gt;(multi-scale)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Subtopics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planning
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road Trips &amp;amp; Pathfinding
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pedestrian Traffic (0% alpha)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road Traffic (50% alpha)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rail Traffic (0% alpha)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Traffic (0% beta)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Traffic (0% beta)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traffic is the pulse of a city &lt;code&gt;(city = organism)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic is a chaotic emergent phenomenon (&lt;code&gt;EMERGENCE&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic shapes the city and the city shapes traffic &lt;code&gt;(interdependent systems)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic shapes lives and lives shape traffic &lt;code&gt;(interdependent systems)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People and goods use a multitude/combinations of transport systems &lt;code&gt;(diverse individuals)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pedestrians &amp;amp; vehicles move &quot;like different kinds of swarms/liquids&quot; &lt;code&gt;(diverse individuals)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(city = anthill)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(vastness)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(flows)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;individuals are the most visible when they are on the move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crowds look antsy, sprawling, colorful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cars can flow nicely but also get really pushy, different types/sizes of cars have obviously different silhouettes and movement patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trains and boats are heavy and careful, they have impressive momentum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;planes are graceful and precise but need a lot of space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always model each trip individually and microscopically (never use statistical models) &lt;code&gt;(actual problem)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(emergence)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical motion through time/space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic use of potentially several modes of transport in sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counteract time-compression with generous behaviour parameters (but never cheat, i.e. teleport) &lt;code&gt;(actual problem) (time compression)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pedestrians, road traffic, public transport and freight transport of all kinds are all equally important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking is a core problem &amp;amp; component of road traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulation goal: trips are successful often enough and efficient enough to power all economic transaction realistically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All kinds of traffic are &quot;vessels/bodies moving along the edges of a transport network graph&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimal granularity of traffic simulation: simulate the most strongly locally interacting traffic entities (e.g. cars on one lane) all at once within one actor (one lane = one actor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay &amp;amp; Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Building a city&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Planning&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Transport Infrastructure Planning&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep car interactions as local as possible computationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cars themselves are not actors, one lane is the atomic actor,&lt;/strong&gt; it updates all the cars on it in one go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars mostly move along a lane like a train, only on switch lanes they can move sideways to merge between normal lanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars react to general obstacles, which are either the next car on their own lane, or cars on interacting lanes, whose position is mapped onto the current lane
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interactions are distinguished as parallel/opposing/merging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting lanes after each update exchange their cars as obstacles for the other lane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use well-known 1D acceleration and breaking model and extend it to multi-lane behaviour
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars on switch lanes have more complex behaviour, reacting to cars on their left &amp;amp; right lanes and other cars merging between them.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the perceived risk/required breaking, merging cars can decide to abort their merge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citybound/citybound/blob/lane/README.md&quot;&gt;Road Lanes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The complex fabric of real road geometry goes beyond &quot;streets&quot; and &quot;intersections&quot;, which at best can be understood as loose groups of related lanes (&lt;code&gt;EMERGENCE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ACTUAL PROBLEM&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Design Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The atomic unit of road geometry in Citybound is the individual lane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roads and intersections are just collections of lanes &lt;code&gt;(emergence)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(flexibility)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really make individual lanes the main abstraction, only group them into higher abstractions when absolutely necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, only handle a group of &quot;nearby/related&quot; lanes temporarily while using a tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citybound/citybound/blob/planning/README.md&quot;&gt;Road Planning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each lane keeps track of
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it's connectivity to preceding/following lanes (connected to it's start or end)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lanes it overlaps, distinguishing between nearly-parallel overlaps and opposing overlaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special case: two parallel lines that can be merged between are not directly connected
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;instead, an invisible &quot;switch lane&quot; is placed along their range of overlap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lanes on either side have a special parallel overlap relation ship to the switch lane only, not to each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reason for this is that merging car behaviour is a more complex special case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/citybound/citybound/blob/microtraffic/README.md&quot;&gt;Car Microtraffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All macro-economic behaviours arise from interactions of individual households (families, companies) &lt;code&gt;(emergence)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of households have both selfish and shared goals, resulting in a trade-off between individuality and cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locality of households and interactions is essential and enables all kinds of logistics and distributed industries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All resources that have to physically moved in real life have to also be moved in Citybound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real estate market is a huge factor in shaping a city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character of a city is largely determined by the sum of its industries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of consumed resources and services depend on complex chains of earlier resources, these resource chains/trees are at the core of shaping industries, the required logistics and thus also a city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player is not supposed to manage supply/demand/resource chains, but to enable them to be as effective as possible, through the means of infrastructure planning and zoning/governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the amount of information presented in the game might go way beyond realistically knowable things, this contrast in availability of information compared to the real world has an educational and almost call-to-action aspect to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals act as a lens to see the game world from, other than the players birds-eye-view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall &quot;macro&quot; appearance of the city hints at general issues which might inspire you to investigate in detail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide both omniscient-level information about individuals as well as realistic large-scale indicators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually model the real estate market with ownership and businesses, including city government ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All complex resources can only be a) traded or b) created from its component parts, never &quot;out of nowhere&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having to rely on absolute amounts for resources makes balancing very hard and amplifies bugs and makes the system potentially very unstable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of different resource types and how fine-grained they are is to be chosen as minimal as possible, while still producing interesting and prevalent resource chains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resources represent both tangible goods as well as intangible (psychological, physiological, social) metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these are measured using scalar values, from -infinity to infinity
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;these values represent how well a household is doing on a particular resource (0 representing ideal), not necessarily absolute stockpile values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One household and its associated resources are always tied to one specific building/location - if this is one location of a larger company, these cooperate mostly as if they were separate businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Crafting recipes&quot; to determine both how resource combine, at which costs, and which businesses do that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Households (20% alpha)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Building a city&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Observation &amp;amp; Inspection&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Inspecting Resource Chains&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Godmode-style knowledge
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Inspect all consumers of the products of a business&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Inspect all the source producers of input resources of a business&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Inspect the full journey/lifecycle of an end product, including becoming waste/...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Business surplus/deficits per resource category&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Infer bottlenecks/problems by showing all related &quot;nodes&quot; in the economic network of one particular business, including paths&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic knowledge
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Infer industry composition based on evident architectural styles&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Directly show all businesses of a precise resource category&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Infer causes of homelessness&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Learn from protests&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Learn from topical advisors&quot; ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Learn about a neighborhood by looking at it&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Planning&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Execution &amp;amp; Finances&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code version control systems and file difference visualizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blueprints/ghost parts in Factorio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In reality it is not only physically impossible to instantaneously build infrastructure, but there are good reasons why planning is employed before even deciding what to build &lt;code&gt;(planning)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plans are easy to revise and iterate on, changing existing structure is extremely costly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can start planning something even when you do not have the permission or resources to implement the plan yet. In fact, you might need to have a plan to show in order to acquire the necessary permission and resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning should be as flexible and forgiving as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The player only ever interacts directly with plans. The only way to affect construction of infrastructure is through implementation of plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plans have full undo/redo history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plans clearly show structures to be added and to be removed relative to what exists. &lt;code&gt;(clarity)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifications of existing structures seamlessly become part of a plan, this should feel as tangible as creating new structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Materialized Reality&quot; and plans exists in completely different &quot;spheres&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of keeping a perfect, complicated two-way mapping between plans and implemented reality at all times, they are kept separate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When new structures are added to a plan or previously planned and implemented structures are modified within the plan, they are compared geometrically in detail with the materialized reality to calculate the actual diff of what would change when implementing the new plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pathfinding information local and dynamically changeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make use of the &quot;highway effect&quot; (for most of each trip, only the rough source and rough destination determine the typically important main connections to choose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to create a trip from household to household (not necessarily precise addresses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trips are a persistent representation of each ongoing trip (since cars themselves are not actors, but exist on road actors, or are exchanged as messages)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trips can be created from and to &quot;rough&quot; locations (such as households), which are then first resolved to precise locations on the road network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a simple two-layer landmark model for the pathfinding itself:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;nodes&quot; (individual lanes) and &quot;landmarks&quot; (groups of lanes, represented as one rough destination)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nodes store closest-next-hop information to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; landmarks, but only to nodes up to a certain distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a node is too far away, first navigate towards its parent landmark, until a direct next-hop is known&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lanes organically join/leave landmarks, keeping landmarks continuous each, and of roughly equal group size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lanes exchange information about changed/updated next-hops with their local neighbors (similar to router table updates), forming an eventually converging network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actions -&amp;gt; Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effects -&amp;gt; Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback -&amp;gt; Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not only the exchange of physical goods influences the decision-making of families, but intangible psychological, physiological, social metrics play an equally if not more important role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no central happiness metric, but only individual diverse motivations that vary both over time as well as from person to person - one can only get a rough overview of &quot;how well someone is doing&quot; by looking at all of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
