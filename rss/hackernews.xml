&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died Friday. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington surrounded by family. She was 87.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,&quot; Chief Justice John Roberts said. &quot;We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage680199454&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/12/26/680199454/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-from-hospital&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/12\/26\/680199454\/supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-from-hospital&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/26/ap_18350118411245_sq-86260dd643507d9388e3b7093ce5391dceb648d0-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/26/ap_18350118411245_sq-86260dd643507d9388e3b7093ce5391dceb648d0-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Released From Hospital&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: &quot;My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming political battle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another Trump appointment so conservatives would have 6-to-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the battle to achieve that will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: He refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court Nominee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. Instead he will try immediately to push through a Trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill Ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if President Trump were to lose his reelection bid. Asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, McConnell said: &quot;Oh, we'd fill it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did — until age 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dream is that I will stay on the court as long as he did,&quot; she said in an interview in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Tough as nails&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn't quite make it. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nonetheless a historic figure. She changed the way the world is for American women. For more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. When she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. Hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. By the time she donned judicial robes, however, Ginsburg had worked a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the Virginia Military Institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. True, Ginsburg said, most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of VMI. But the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,&quot; Ginsburg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was &quot;tough as nails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. She was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her &quot;Notorious RBG&quot; moniker, a &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine cover and regular &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion in 2016, Ginsburg got herself into trouble and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/07/14/486080234/listen-justice-ginsburg-expands-on-decision-to-apologize-for-trump-remarks&quot;&gt;later publicly apologized&lt;/a&gt; for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the most part Ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 State of the Union address, Ginsburg did not take the Fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. The result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely &quot;sober judge&quot; and kept nodding off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Ruth Bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler. By all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but Celia Bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then 17, Ruth Bader went on to Cornell University on a full scholarship, where she met Martin (aka &quot;Marty&quot;) Ginsburg. &quot;What made Marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that I had a brain,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her graduation, they were married and went off to Fort Sill, Okla., for his military service. There Mrs. Ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, the couple returned to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. She was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that &quot;should go to a man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. The couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when Marty Ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Surgeries and aggressive radiation followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So that left Ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me,&quot; said Marty Ginsburg in a 1993 interview with NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. During the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. At about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled in an NPR interview. &quot;Then I'd take out the books and start reading what I needed to be prepared for classes the next day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in New York; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. Despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a Supreme Court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her &quot;familial obligations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentor, law professor Gerald Gunther, finally got her a clerkship in New York by promising Judge Edmund Palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. That was &quot;the carrot,&quot; Ginsburg would say later. &quot;The stick&quot; was that Gunther, who regularly fed his best students to Palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take Ginsburg, Gunther would never send him a clerk again. The Ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; Palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. She learned Swedish so she could work with Anders Bruzelius, a Swedish civil procedure scholar. Through the Columbia University School of Law Project on International Procedure, Ginsburg and Bruzelius co-authored a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1963, Ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at Rutgers Law School, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. The ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &quot;mother brief&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a Colorado man named Charles Moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. The IRS said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. But Moritz had never married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax court concluded that the Internal Revenue Code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer Marty Ginsburg viewed as &quot;preposterous.&quot; The two Ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res680478780&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Marty Ginsburg, for his wife, this was the &quot;mother brief.&quot; She had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. The solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. She won in the lower courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazingly,&quot; he recalled in a 1993 NPR interview, the government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the decision &quot;cast a cloud of unconstitutionality&quot; over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with Defense Department computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those laws, Marty Ginsburg added, &quot;were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, she would write her first Supreme Court brief in the case of &lt;em&gt;Reed v. Reed.&lt;/em&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented Sally Reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. The answer from the all-male Supreme Court: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then Ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. She would become the first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School, and she would found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, Ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked Social Security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. For example, in &lt;em&gt;Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld&lt;/em&gt;, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. The husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing Social Security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children,&quot; Ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. The Supreme Court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ensuing years, Ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities, but to women as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with NPR, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The words of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause — 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' Well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. And the Supreme Court woke up to that reality in 1971,&quot; Ginsburg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these pioneering years, Ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. But by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scrapes were hardly major, and Ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. Finally, there came a day when she had had enough. &quot;I had stayed up all night the night before, and I said to the principal, 'This child has two parents. Please alternate calls.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, she found, the calls were few and far between. It seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court's second woman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980 then-President Jimmy Carter named Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Over the next 13 years, she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal, and in 1993 then-President Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court, the second woman appointed to the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was not first on his list. For months Clinton flirted with other potential nominees, and some women's rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about Ginsburg's views on abortion. She had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the background, Marty Ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife. And finally Ruth Ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president. As one White House official put it afterward, Clinton &quot;fell for her--hook, line and sinker.&quot; So did the Senate. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the court, Ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes. Though she looked tiny and frail, she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing. At home, it was her husband who was the chef, indeed a master chef, while the justice cheerfully acknowledged that she was an awful cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a liberal, she and the court's conservative icon, Antonin Scalia, now deceased, were the closest of friends. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/07/10/200137481/scalia-v-ginsburg-supreme-court-sparring-put-to-music&quot;&gt;an opera called &lt;em&gt;Scalia/Ginsburg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is based on their legal disagreements, and their affection for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as Ginsburg's place on the court grew in seniority, so did her role. In 2006, as the court veered right after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively, her most passionate dissents coming in women's rights cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissenting in &lt;em&gt;Ledbetter v. Goodyear&lt;/em&gt; in 2007, she called on Congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back-pay available for victims of employment discrimination. The resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after President Barack Obama took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res680480386&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage466848775&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/02/15/466848775/scalia-ginsburg-opera-commemorates-sparring-supreme-court-friendship&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/02\/15\/466848775\/scalia-ginsburg-opera-commemorates-sparring-supreme-court-friendship&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/02/15/gettyimages-485357525_sq-b52b2fb5b0264b8b87575737009b1e323273cb9d-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/02/15/gettyimages-485357525_sq-b52b2fb5b0264b8b87575737009b1e323273cb9d-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Ginsburg And Scalia: 'Best Buddies'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, she dissented fiercely from the court's decision in &lt;em&gt;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby,&lt;/em&gt; a decision that allowed some for-profit companies to refuse, on religious grounds, to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans. Such an exemption, she said, would &quot;deny legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs, access to contraceptive coverage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where, she asked, &quot;is the stopping point?&quot; Suppose it offends an employer's religious belief &quot;to pay the minimum wage&quot; or &quot;to accord women equal pay?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2013, when the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed, Ginsburg dissented. She said that throwing out the provision &quot;when it has worked and is continuing to work ... is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions,&quot; Ginsburg told NPR. &quot;I will not live to see what becomes of them, but I remain hopeful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, Ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases. In 2015, for example, she authored the court's decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res680475481&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage679065534&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/12/21/679065534/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-undergoes-surgery-for-lung-cancer&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/12\/21\/679065534\/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-undergoes-surgery-for-lung-cancer&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/21/gettyimages-1041254064_sq-7c0c47ac26c3fe64c96336e218e38a67a3785124-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/21/gettyimages-1041254064_sq-7c0c47ac26c3fe64c96336e218e38a67a3785124-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Undergoes Surgery For Lung Cancer&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; even after five bouts with cancer: colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer 10 years later, lung cancer in 2018, and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020. During that time, she endured chemotherapy, radiation, and in the last years of her life, terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely. All who knew her admired her grit. In 2009, three weeks after major cancer surgery, she surprised everyone when she showed up for the State of the Union address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, she was back on the bench; it was her husband Marty who told her she could do it, even when she thought she could not, she told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill. As she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die, she found a note he had written to her. &quot;My Dearest Ruth,&quot; it began, &quot;You are the only person I have ever loved,&quot; setting aside children and family. &quot;I have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at Cornell....The time has come for me to ... take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms. I hope you will support where I come out, but I understand you may not. I will not love you a jot less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, Marty Ginsburg died at home. The next day, his wife, the justice, was on the bench, reading an important opinion she had authored for the court. She was there, she said, because &quot;Marty would have wanted it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, she would read the letter aloud in an NPR interview, and at the end, choke down the tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years after Marty's death, she would persevere without him, maintaining a jam-packed schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some liberals criticicized her for not retiring while Obama was president, but she was at the top of her game, enjoyed her work enormously, and feared that Republicans might not confirm a successor. She was an avid consumer of opera, literature, and modern art. But in the end, it was her work, she said, that sustained her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do think that I was born under a very bright star,&quot; she said in an NPR interview. &quot;Because if you think about my life, I get out of law school. I have top grades. No law firm in the city of New York will hire me. I end up teaching; it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was that legal crusade for women's rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the end of her tenure, she remained a special kind of feminist, both decorous and dogged.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Presence of One’s Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462?journalCode=jacr</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Our smartphones enable—and encourage—constant connection to information, entertainment, and each other. They put the world at our fingertips, and rarely leave our sides. Although these devices have immense potential to improve welfare, their persistent presence may come at a cognitive cost. In this research, we test the “brain drain” hypothesis that the mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance. Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making and consumer welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdowns</title>
<link>https://apnews.com/a439ead01b75fc958c722daf40f9307c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apnews.com/a439ead01b75fc958c722daf40f9307c</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. — a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok won’t face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/880948bbfd3da8c35c84a0d9556375a6&quot;&gt;weeks of dealmaking&lt;/a&gt; over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app’s Chinese owner to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data collection and related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;California tech giant Oracle recently &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/880948bbfd3da8c35c84a0d9556375a6&quot;&gt;struck a deal with TikTok&lt;/a&gt; along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular,” said “we have to have the total security from China,” and added that “we can do a combination of both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The new order puts pressure on TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump’s “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Component-dfp-0-2-78&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;relatedStory-0-2-83 Component-block-0-2-79&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Tech Stories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Similar technical limitations for TikTok don’t go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that “the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business.” Users, meanwhile, face a security “nightmare” because they won’t be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The technical measures are “enforceable, the question is whether they are legal,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Lewis, likening them to a U.S. version of China’s “Great Firewall,” which censors its domestic internet. He said there could be a First Amendment challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users’ posts. It grabs users’ locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;afs:Content:9446380697&quot; data-key=&quot;hub-link-embed&quot; class=&quot;Component-hubLink-0-2-80&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;title-0-2-87&quot;&gt;Full Coverage: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link-0-2-88 overrideArticle&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/tag/apf-technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand cooperation from Chinese companies. The administration, however, has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Some cybersecurity experts question whether the administration’s efforts are more political than rooted in legitimate concerns about Chinese threats to data security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;“If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population,” said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department’s regulations were announced. “We’re not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we’re trying to hack this together to hurt China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Use long flags when scripting (2013)</title>
<link>https://changelog.com/posts/use-long-flags-when-scripting</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://changelog.com/posts/use-long-flags-when-scripting</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I peruse a fair amount of dotfile repos, and keep seeing people use short flags inside aliases and little command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short flags are a &lt;mark&gt;command line shortcut&lt;/mark&gt;, and they do belong there, but if you’re not writing the command in a prompt, do yourself (and anyone else that may someday be reading your code) a favor and be more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;curl --silent checkip.dyndns.org \
| grep --extended-regexp --only-matching '[0-9\.]+'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a lot easier for a human to understand than this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;curl -s checkip.dyndns.org | grep -Eo '[0-9\.]+'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(First time here? You should &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/changelog&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vue.js 3</title>
<link>https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0</guid>
<description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/499550/93624428-53932780-f9ae-11ea-8d16-af949e16a09f.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/499550/93624428-53932780-f9ae-11ea-8d16-af949e16a09f.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are proud to announce the official release of Vue.js 3.0 &quot;One Piece&quot;. This new major version of the framework provides improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, better TypeScript integration, new APIs for tackling large scale use cases, and a solid foundation for long-term future iterations of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3.0 release represents over 2 years of development efforts, featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/tree/master/active-rfcs&quot;&gt;30+ RFCs&lt;/a&gt;, 2,600+ commits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-author%3Aapp%2Fdependabot-preview+&quot;&gt;628 pull requests&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;99 contributors&lt;/a&gt;, plus tremendous amount of development and documentation work outside of the core repo. We would like to express our deepest gratitude towards our team members for taking on this challenge, our contributors for the pull requests, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/BACKERS.md&quot;&gt;sponsors and backers&lt;/a&gt; for the financial support, and the wider community for participating in our design discussions and providing feedback for the pre-release versions. Vue is an independent project created for the community and sustained by the community, and Vue 3.0 wouldn't have been possible without your consistent support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking the &quot;Progressive Framework&quot; Concept Further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue had a simple mission from its humble beginning: to be an approachable framework that anyone can quickly learn. As our user base grew, the framework also grew in scope to adapt to the increasing demands. Over time, it evolved into what we call a &quot;Progressive Framework&quot;: a framework that can be learned and adopted incrementally, while providing continued support as the user tackles more and more demanding scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, with over 1.3 million users worldwide&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, we are seeing Vue being used in a wildly diverse range of scenarios, from sprinkling interactivity on traditional server-rendered pages, to full-blown single page applications with hundreds of components. Vue 3 takes this flexibility even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layered internal modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue 3.0 core can still be used via a simple &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, but its internals has been re-written from the ground up into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/tree/master/packages&quot;&gt;a collection of decoupled modules&lt;/a&gt;. The new architecture provides better maintainability, and allows end users to shave off up to half of the runtime size via tree-shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modules also exposes lower-level APIs that unlocks many advanced use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The compiler supports custom AST transforms for build-time customizations (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-extensions&quot;&gt;build-time i18n&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core runtime provides first-class API for creating custom renderers targeting different render targets (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue-next&quot;&gt;native mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Planning-nl/vugel&quot;&gt;WebGL&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ycmjason/vuminal&quot;&gt;terminals&lt;/a&gt;). The default DOM renderer is built using the same API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/tree/master/packages/reactivity&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@vue/reactivity&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt; exports functions that provide direct access to Vue's reactivity system, and can be used as a standalone package. It can be used to pair with other templating solutions (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-lit&quot;&gt;lit-html&lt;/a&gt;) or even in non-UI scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New APIs for tackling scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.x Object-based API is largely intact in Vue 3. However, 3.0 also introduces the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Composition API&lt;/a&gt; - a new set of APIs aimed at addressing the pain points of Vue usage in large scale applications. The Composition API builds on top of the reactivity API and enables logic composition and reuse similar to React hooks, more flexible code organization patterns, and more reliable type inference than the 2.x Object-based API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composition API can also be used with Vue 2.x via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api&quot;&gt;@vue/composition-api&lt;/a&gt; plugin, and there are already Composition API utility libraries that work for both Vue 2 and 3 (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antfu/vueuse&quot;&gt;vueuse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pikax/vue-composable&quot;&gt;vue-composable&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue 3 has demonstrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJFx-kQ4KjJmnpDXIEaig-cVAAJtpIGLZNbv3Lr4CR0/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;significant performance improvements&lt;/a&gt; over Vue 2 in terms of bundle size (up to 41% lighter with tree-shaking), initial render (up to 55% faster), updates (up to 133% faster), and memory usage (up to 54% less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vue 3, we have taken the approach of &quot;compiler-informed Virtual DOM&quot;: the template compiler performs aggressive optimizations and generates render function code that hoists static content, leaves runtime hints for binding types, and most importantly, flattens the dynamic nodes inside a template to reduce the cost of runtime traversal. The user therefore gets the best of both worlds: compiler-optimized performance from templates, or direct control via manual render functions when the use case demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improved TypeScript integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue 3's codebase is written in TypeScript, with automatically generated, tested, and bundled type definitions so they are always up-to-date. Composition API works great with type inference. Vetur, our official VSCode extension, now supports template expression and props type checking leveraging Vue 3's improved internal typing. Oh, and Vue 3's typing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/blob/master/test-dts/defineComponent.test-d.tsx&quot;&gt;fully supports TSX&lt;/a&gt; if that's your preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experimental Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/182&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;pull_request&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/vuejs/rfcs/pull/182/hovercard&quot;&gt;two new features&lt;/a&gt; for Singe-File Components (SFC, aka &lt;code&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; files):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are already implemented and available in Vue 3.0, but are provided only for the purpose of gathering feedback. They will remain experimental until the RFCs are merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also implemented a currently undocumented &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Suspense&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, which allows waiting on nested async dependencies (async components or component with &lt;code&gt;async setup()&lt;/code&gt;) on initial render or branch switch. We are testing and iterating on this feature with the Nuxt.js team (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nuxtjs.slides.com/atinux/state-of-nuxt-2020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nuxt 3 is on the way&lt;/a&gt;) and will likely solidify it in 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phased Release Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of Vue 3.0 marks the general readiness of the framework. While some of the frameworks sub projects may still need further work to reach stable status (specifically router and Vuex integration in the devtools), we believe it's suitable to start new, green-field projects with Vue 3 today. We also encourage library authors to start upgrading your projects to support Vue 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#supporting-libraries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vue 3 Libraries Guide&lt;/a&gt; for details on all framework sub projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Migration and IE11 Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have pushed back the migration build (v3 build with v2 compatible behavior + migration warnings) and the IE11 build due to time constraints, and are aiming to focus on them in Q4 2020. Therefore, users planning to migrate an existing v2 app or require IE11 support should be aware of these limitations at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the near term after release, we will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migration build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IE11 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Router and Vuex integration in new devtools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further improvements to template type inference in Vetur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time being, the documentation websites, GitHub branches, and npm dist tags for Vue 3 and v3-targeting projects will remain under &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;-denoted status. This means &lt;code&gt;npm install vue&lt;/code&gt; will still install Vue 2.x and &lt;code&gt;npm install vue@next&lt;/code&gt; will install Vue 3. &lt;strong&gt;We are planning to switch all doc links, branches and dist tags to default to 3.0 by end of 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have started planning for 2.7, which will be the last planned minor release of the 2.x release line. 2.7 will be backporting compatible improvements from v3, and emit warnings on usage of APIs that are removed/changed in v3 to help with potential migration. We are planning to work on 2.7 in Q1 2021, which will directly become LTS upon release with an 18 months maintenance lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying It Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Vue 3.0, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://v3.vuejs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new documentation website&lt;/a&gt;. If you are an existing Vue 2.x user, go directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Migration Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CEO of Cyber Fraud Startup NS8 Arrested by FBI, Facing Fraud Charges</title>

<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5f5be44de9e1aa5c37dfcbb9/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Aerial View of Las Vegas, Nevada&quot; data-height=&quot;3413&quot; data-width=&quot;5119&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Adam Rogas, CEO of fraud prevention software startup NS8, was arrested by the FBI Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO of a startup that sold fraud prevention software is facing fraud charges after he was arrested Thursday by the FBI in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Rogas, who abruptly resigned from NS8 earlier this month, is accused of misleading investors who poured in $123 million to his company earlier this year, a deal in which he allegedly pocketed more than $17 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adam Rogas was the proverbial fox guarding the henhouse,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a press statement. “While raising over $100 million from investors for his fraud prevention company, Rogas himself allegedly was engaging in a brazen fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NS8 launched in 2016 to provide online fraud detection and prevention software for small businesses. More than 200 NS8 employees were laid off last week after executives told them the company was under investigation by the SEC for fraud. The news was startling for many, considering the company had announced a $123 million Series A funding round in June, led by global VC firm Lightspeed Venture Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, NS8 said that its board “has learned that much of the company’s revenue and customer information had been fabricated by Mr. Rogas.” The company added that no other employees or stakeholders had been charged and that it is cooperating with federal investigators.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous statement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/09/11/fraud-prevention-startup-ns8-fraud-investigation-sec/#5714dbee7af8&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/09/11/fraud-prevention-startup-ns8-fraud-investigation-sec/#5714dbee7af8&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/09/11/fraud-prevention-startup-ns8-fraud-investigation-sec/#5714dbee7af8&quot; aria-label=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track=&quot;InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/09/11/fraud-prevention-startup-ns8-fraud-investigation-sec/#5714dbee7af8&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rogas said that he left the company for family and personal reasons. He then alleged that NS8’s board and current management have used “an SEC investigation that began in November of 2019 to insinuate a more insidious narrative...I did not walk away with the companies [sic] money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogas is facing multiple charges, including securities fraud and wire fraud, in separate complaints filed by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday. Charges by the Justice Department carry penalties up to 20 years in prison. Rogas is expected to face a judge in Nevada on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, the Justice Department alleged that from January 2019 to February 2020, between 40% and 95% of NS8’s assets were made up. During that period, the agency alleged, Rogas presented doctored bank statements to reflect over $40 million in fictitious revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SEC’s complaint, the agency alleged that Rogas doctored NS8's bank statements to show millions of dollars in payments from customers, before sending the falsified statements and revenue figures to NS8's finance department. The agency further alleged that in at least two securities offerings, NS8 and Rogas provided investors and prospective investors with the false financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems ironic that the co-founder of a company designed to prevent online fraud would engage in fraudulent activity himself,” said FBI assistant director William F. Sweeney Jr. in a statement. “We’ve seen far too many examples of unscrupulous actors engaging in this type of criminal activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deferred shading.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Directional light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point light + shadows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spot light + shadows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bump mapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Volumetric light (spot, point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Render in texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-camera rendering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scene graph with pivot, camera, mesh, light, particle system, sprite nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in save/load - save/load state of engine in one call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d-sound&quot;&gt;High quality binaural sound with HRTF support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skinning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particle systems with soft particles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A* pathfinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navmesh.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A lawyer for Julian Assange told a London court on Friday that she was present when an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump offered to arrange a pardon for the WikiLeaks founder in return for information that would “benefit President Trump politically”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Australian-born Assange, 49, is fighting to avoid being sent to the United States, where he is charged with conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law over the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said in a witness statement to the court that she observed a meeting at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2017 between Assange and Republican then-U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;She said Rohrabacher and an assistant offered to arrange a pardon for Assange in return for information about the hacking of Democratic emails before the 2016 U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“They stated that President Trump was aware of and had approved of them coming to meet with Mr Assange to discuss a proposal – and that they would have an audience with the President to discuss the matter on their return to Washington DC,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“The proposal put forward by Congressman Rohrabacher was that Mr. Assange identify the source for the 2016 election publications in return for some form of pardon, assurance or agreement, which would both benefit President Trump politically and prevent U.S. indictment and extradition,” Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Assange’s legal team first said at hearings in February that Rohrabacher had conveyed a pardon offer to Assange. At the time, the White House called the assertion that Trump had tried to reach a deal with Assange “a complete fabrication and a total lie”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ArticleBody-slideshow-small-mFJ54&quot;&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;FullscreenOverlay-button-1FTU6 Slideshow-inline-image-container-1dktB&quot; aria-label=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;


&lt;/button&gt;Slideshow &lt;span&gt;( 2 images )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Rohrabacher said he had never spoken with the president about Assange, denied being sent on Trump’s behalf and said he was acting on his own when he offered to ask Trump for a pardon for Assange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Robinson said Rohrabacher’s offer was presented to Assange as a “win-win” solution that would allow Assange “to get on with his life” and in return would also politically benefit Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, WikiLeaks published a series of Democratic National Committee emails damaging to candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. investigators have concluded that the emails were hacked by Russia as part of an effort to influence the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The 2016 election leaks are not directly a part of the U.S. criminal case against Assange, which covers secret military and diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks several years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Assange is fighting the U.S. extradition request, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped. After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy by British police in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Ending &quot;Fortnite Save the World&quot; Updates for Mac</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple is preventing Epic from signing games and patches for distribution on Mac, which ends our ability to develop and offer Fortnite: Save the World for the platform. Specifically, our upcoming v14.20 release will cause bugs for players on v13.40, resulting in a very poor experience. Since we are no longer able to sign updates and release fixes for these issues, beginning September 23, 2020, Fortnite: Save the World will no longer be playable on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are issuing a refund for all players who purchased any Save the World Founder’s or Starter Packs (including Upgrades) and played Save the World on macOS between September 17, 2019 and September 17, 2020. Additionally, any purchased V-Bucks spent on Llamas on macOS in this period will also be refunded. As of today, September 17, 2020, Save the World Starter Packs will no longer be available for purchase on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; It may take up until October 2, 2020 to receive the refund in your bank account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no action needed on your part to receive the refund and you will retain any previously purchased V-Bucks and items on your account. Players will still be able to play Save the World on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, and thanks to cross-progression, your Heroes, Schematics and everything else in your Homebase will automatically transfer across supported platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortnite: Battle Royale remains playable for Mac users at this time on the v13.40 build, but is no longer receiving version updates due to Apple’s actions. The latest version of Fortnite: Battle Royale is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, GeForce Now, and on Android through both the Epic Games App at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/mobile/android/get-started&quot;&gt;epicgames.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.epicgames.portal&quot;&gt;Samsung Galaxy Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details on Apple’s decision to block Fortnite, read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/freefortnite&quot;&gt;#FreeFortnite&lt;/a&gt; blog post and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/free-fortnite-faq&quot;&gt;#FreeFortnite FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
