<description>&lt;div id=&quot;abstract-ish&quot; readability=&quot;58.338141025641&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we enable more science fiction to become reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to do something, it usually pays to study those who have done that thing successfully in the past. Asking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;‘what is this outlier’s production function?’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;can provide a starting point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA is an outlier organization in the world of turning science fiction into reality. Since 1958, it has been a driving force in the creation of weather satellites, GPS, personal computers, modern robotics, the Internet, autonomous cars, and voice interfaces, to name a few. However, it is primarily limited to the domain of defense technology – there are DARPA-style ideas that are out of its scope.  Which emulatable attributes contributed to DARPA’s outlier results?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;What does a&lt;/span&gt; domain-independent “ARPA Model” look like? &lt;span&gt;Is it possible to build other organizations that generate equally huge results in other domains by riffing on that model?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallons of ink have been spilled describing &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; DARPA works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in a nutshell here is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;how DARPA works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Around 100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;program managers (PMs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with ~5 year appointments create and run &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;programs&lt;/span&gt; to pursue high-level visions like “actualize the idea of man-comp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;uter symbiosis.” In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both big and small companies to do research&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;performers&lt;/span&gt;. Top-level authority lies with a &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Director&lt;/span&gt; who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA has an incredibly powerful model for innovation in defense research, and I believe an abstract ‘&lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;ARPA Model&lt;/span&gt;’ could yield similar results in other domains. In this piece I’ll explain in detail why DARPA works. I’ll use that description to feel out and describe to the best of my ability a platonic ARPA Model.  I’ll also distill some of the model’s implications for potential riffs on the model. Incidentally, I’m working on just such an imitator, and in future essays, I’ll explain why this model could be incredibly powerful when executed in a privately-funded context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to use this document&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document acts more like a collection of atomic notes than a tight essay – a DARPA-themed tapas if you will. The order of the sections is more of a guideline than a law so feel free to skip around. Throughout you will come across internal links that &lt;a id=&quot;self-link&quot; class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#self-link&quot;&gt;look like this&lt;/a&gt;. These links are an attempt to illustrate the interconnectedness of the ARPA Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two stand-alone pieces to accomodate your time and interest:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#distillation&quot;&gt;distillation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.nbyw8g2b67uk&quot;&gt;full work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The distillation is meant to capture and compress the main points of the full work. Each section of the distillation internally links to the corresponding section one level deeper so if you want more info and nuance you can get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;noteToReader&quot;&gt;I would rather this be read by a few people motivated to take action than by a broad audience who will find it merely interesting. In that vein, if you find yourself wanting to share this on Twitter or Hacker News, consider instead sharing it with one or two friends who will take action on it. Thank you for indulging me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;program_managers_mini&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Program Managers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;At the end of the day the ARPA Model depends on badass program managers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is this the case? PMs need to think for themselves and go up and down the ladder of abstraction in an unstructured environment. On top of that they need to be effective communicators and coordinators because so much of their jobs is building networks. There’s a pattern that the abstract qualities that make “great talent” in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. Given that pattern, the people who would make good DARPA PMs would &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;people’s motivations for becoming a PM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is important. More precise details about what makes a PM good prevent you from going after the exact same people as every other high-variance industry. When ‘talent’ isn’t code for ‘specialized training’ it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about ‘the ARPA Model’ we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than actually exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors&quot;&gt;DARPA program managers pull control and risk away from both researchers and directors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; PMs pull control away from directors by having only one official checkpoint before launching programs and pull control away from performers through their ability to move money around quickly. PMs design programs to be high-risk aggregations of lower-risk projects. Only 5–10 out of every 100 programs successfully produce transformative research, while only 10% of projects are terminated early. Shifting the risk from the performers to the program managers enables DARPA to tackle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;systemic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;problems where other models cannot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases&quot;&gt;The best program managers notice systemic biases and attack them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;For example, noticing that all of the finite element modeling literature assumes a locally static situation and asking ‘what if it was dynamic?’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“The best program managers can get into the trees and still see the forest.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Obviously, this quality is rather fuzzy but leads to two precise questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you find people who can uncover systemic biases in a discipline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;How could you systematize finding systemic biases in a discipline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first question suggests that you should seek out heretics and people with expertise who are not experts. The second question suggests building structured frameworks for mapping a discipline and its assumptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt;A large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is focused network building&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;DARPA PMs network in the literal sense of creating networks, not just plugging into them. PMs meet disparate people working on ideas adjacent to the area in which they want to have an impact and bring them together in small workshops to dig into which possibilities are not impossible and what it would take to make them possible. The PMs host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;performer days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; — small private conferences for all the people working on different pieces of the program where performers can exchange ideas on what is working, what isn’t working, and build connections that don’t depend on the PM.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider&quot;&gt;J.C.R. Licklider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a paragon here. He brought together all the crazy people interested in human-focused computing. On top of that,  he also helped create the first computer science lab groups. PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations – government, academia, startups, and large companies. These connections smooth the path for technologies to go from the lab to the shelf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego&quot;&gt;DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why does this matter? When you are surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they’re saying because it’s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking for yourself allows you to avoid these traps. PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to ask questions nobody else is asking. A large ego would lead to a program manager imposing their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of top down problems and bottom up solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers&quot;&gt;DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are legal provisions in place that let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through rules – minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players’ is incredibly important.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years&quot;&gt;DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This transience is important for many reasons. Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. You’re out regardless of success or failure. Explicitly temporary roles can incentivize people with many options to join because they can have a huge impact, and then do something else. There’s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that will be. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;Why do people become DARPA Program managers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; From a career and money standpoint, being a program manager seems pretty rough.&lt;span&gt; There are unique benefits though. It offers an outlet for people frustrated with the conservative nature of academia. The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people. Patriotism is definitely a factor, and hard to replicate outside of a government. Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small, elite group of peers who will know what you did. Finally, there may be a particular technological vision they want to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;incentives_and_structure_mini&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incentives and Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt;Opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Congress and the DoD have little default oversight into how a PM is spending money and running a program.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Opacity removes incentives to go for easy wins or to avoid being criticized by external forces. Of course, opacity can also be abused in too many ways to list, so it’s important to ask: How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse opacity? DARPA’s small size and flat structure enable peer pressure to work in positive ways. Finite tenures either make people want to utterly crush it or not care at all. The former happens when you empower driven program managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_government’s_influence_on_darpa_is_buffered_by_opacity_and_the_director&quot;&gt;The government’s influence on DARPA is buffered by opacity and the director.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Opacity is especially important for DAPRA because a source of money like Congress that has many opinions exacerbates the incentive to ‘play it safe.’ Committees lead to median results and ensuring that any action you take is acceptable to a committee is almost as bad as the committee determining those actions.  An opinionated director is the lynchpin keeping DARPA focused on long-term ideas that nobody is asking for (yet.) At several points in its history, the director went to bat to keep DARPA from being dissolved or absorbed into the military as a more “normal” R&amp;amp;D organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation&quot;&gt;DARPA does multiple levels of top-down problem generation and bottom-up solution generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In some ways PMs act as ‘bottom-up’ idea generation – often creating the idea for the program and soliciting project ideas from the community. In other ways PMs act as a ‘top down’ force by pushing researchers to work on a well-defined problem. DARPA completely sidesteps the always-important question “is top-down or bottom-up better?” by doing both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_transient_nature_of_most_people_at_darpa_enables_ideas_to_be_revisited&quot;&gt;The transient nature of most people at DARPA enables ideas to be revisited.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obviously institutional memory lasts longer than any individual but memory of any specific programs dies out quickly. There is only one PM running any given program and people pay much more attention to their own work than other people’s. This transient memory about specific ideas allows them to be judged on their own merits instead of dealing with baggage from the past. The ability to revisit ideas enables DARPA to explore ‘unexploited Leonardo Ideas’ – good ideas that are before their time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat&quot;&gt;DARPA is relatively tiny and flat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of April 2020, DARPA has 124 staff and three layers of management. That number is right around Dunbar’s Number – just small enough for one person to know everyone in the organization. The small organization means that there are no “group projects” so every PM is directly responsible for the program they’re working on and you can’t have slackers. Small size also helps keep PM quality high by removing pressure to hire a lot of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_employees_aren’t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be&quot;&gt;DARPA Employees aren’t paid very much compared to what they could be.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2017, a program managers’ estimated salary was ~$90k compared to the $170k+ an experienced technical PhD could expect  even outside of software engineering. There is a positive and a negative argument for low pay. The positive argument is that it weeds out people who are just in it for the money and treat the role as ‘just a job.’ On the other hand, the low pay may weed out people who have some lower bound on what they think they’re worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa’s_aversion_to_people_with_a_web_presence_may_be_how_they_avoid_asymmetric_career_risk&quot;&gt;DARPA’s aversion to people with a web presence may be how they avoid asymmetric career risk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a former PM,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;DARPA avoids hiring people with a significant web presence. In the 21st century, that’s remarkable and specific enough that it is worth digging into. People with a strong web presence tend to be focused on playing  status games or at least are in a world where they realize that their career depends on public perception of their output.  If you know it’s easy to shut something down it’s easier to start so less Internet presence means less grand announcements and fewer expectations. Of course, the explanation could also be that DARPA just doesn’t like people who are too loud because they like to keep things hush hush.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_doesn’t_do_any_research_in_house&quot;&gt;DARPA doesn’t do any research in house.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some subtle advantages of externalizing research:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables DARPA to be relatively tiny and flat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actual cutting edge research may require rare equipment or knowledge. There are many pieces of equipment or tacit knowledge that only exist in one or two places in the world and it’s easier to access them through finite projects than purchasing or hiring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables strong accountability because for any program there is exactly one responsible person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables program managers to have multiple teams working on the same objective without internal politics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You don’t have to lay anyone off or find new work for people when you change direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can get people to work on projects who might not want to work for the org full time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;process_mini&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops&quot;&gt; many tight feedback loops.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Feedback loops start day one – ‘onboarding’ at DARPA is an informal process that involves mostly oral traditions and shadowing. Informal onboarding is normally a best-practice no-no but that is because most organizations don’t limit themselves to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat&quot;&gt; Dunbar’s number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Program managers get significant informal feedback from other PMs as they hone their program design. PMs have informal conversations with researchers, invite them to small workshops, and fund small fast projects to test assumptions. These activities set up feedback loops not just between researchers and the PM but between the researchers themselves, sometimes spawning new research communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_initial_exploratory_tranche_of_a_darpa_program_is_approximately_$1.5m&quot;&gt;The initial exploratory tranche of a DARPA program is approximately $1.5m.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Most of this money goes towards small &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;seedling projects&lt;/span&gt;. These seedling projects are small grants or contracts designed to help solidify that an idea is both not impossible and that it is in fact possible within scope. Intriguingly, this is in the same ballpark as a large seed round for a startup or the amount of money you need to set up an academic lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;DARPA PMs use seedling projects to ‘acid test’ the riskiest pieces of a program idea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Seedlings are 3–9 month projects that cost  $0.05M to $1M and are designed to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“Move concepts from ‘disbelief’ to ‘mere doubt’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; during program design. There is little oversight on the money spent on seedling projects as long as the budget is less than ~$500k. Seedlings are not about finding a solution to a problem, they’re designed to verify or disprove a hypothesis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;Every program at DARPA is intensely technically scrutinized by the tech council.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Tech Council&lt;/span&gt; is composed of people with technical expertise in the proposed program’s area and adjacent areas. The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt; Tech Council Pitch Meeting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is meant to be high level but council members can ask deep technical questions on anything.  The tech council doesn’t have any power besides advising the director on the program’s technical soundness. A purely advisory tech council seems like a good idea because it both avoids decision by committee and keeps all responsibility squarely on the director and PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_‘framework’_darpa_pms_use_to_create_a_program_is_to_mentally_model_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;The ‘framework’ DARPA PMs use to create a program is by modeling the tech council.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;According to PMs I’ve grilled on this question, the closest thing to a framework that PMs use to guide program design is “be able to explain precisely why this idea will work to a group of really smart experts both in the area of the program and adjacent to it.” While the framework doesn’t have much structure, it does give PMs a very fixed end goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_facilitates_cross-polination_both_between_pms_and_performers&quot;&gt;DARPA facilitates cross-pollination both between PMs and Performers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everybody at DARPA has deep experience in some technical area and there is a culture of people dropping by and asking each other about the subject of their expertise. This cultural artifact is special because it would be easy for everybody to mind their own business as everybody is working on their own programs. Performers who get DARPA funding are required to share research with each other at various closed-door workshops. This sharing is valuable because they are all working on different aspects of the same problem and academia often incentivizes sharing only after work is published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_provides_a_derisking_role_for_people_in_other_organizations&quot;&gt;DARPA provides a derisking role for people in other organizations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA derisks working on breakthrough ideas for three groups: researchers, companies, and other funders. Researchers don’t have as much uncertainty around grant proposals. PMs derisk working off the beaten path for researchers more subtly by building a community around a technological vision. DARPA derisks working off the beaten path for small companies by giving them more confidence that there will be customers for their product – either large companies or the government. For large companies, the off-the-balance sheet work to show that an idea is feasible and has evidence of demand derisks the idea to the point that they’re willing to start spending their own R&amp;amp;D dollars on it. Previous DARPA funding can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;derisk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; an idea to the point that more risk-averse grant-giving organizations like the NSF are willing to start funding it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of the first step, a PM should have a concrete vision of where the world could go, evidence that ‘on paper’ it doesn’t violate known physics, and a precise list of experiments you would want to do before subjecting it to the scrutiny of the tech council – a group of technical experts in the program’s area and adjacent areas. At the end of the second step, a PM should have demonstration-based evidence that creating the vision is possible and a roadmap for how to get there. PMs get informal feedback throughout the program design process on whether the program is likely to be approved by the council.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So the math works out that only ~$400m is actually being spent on ‘basic research.’ These raw numbers raise the question – is there a ‘minimum effective budget’ to generate outlier results? If so, what is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_more_ideas_limited_than_money_limited&quot;&gt;DARPA is more ideas limited than money limited.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This excerpt is gold:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“I never really felt constrained by money,” (former DARPA director) Tether says. “I was more constrained by ideas.” In fact, aerospace engineer Verne (Larry) Lynn, DARPA’s director from 1995 to 1998, says he successfully lobbied Congress to shrink his budget after the Clinton administration had boosted it to “dangerous levels” to finance a short-lived technology reinvestment program. “When an organization becomes bigger, it becomes more bureaucratic,” Lynn told an interviewer in 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Why is DARPA ideas limited? Among the possibilities: A limited number of ideas fall into the sweet spot of high-risk, high reward military applications; pouring more money on ideas that aren’t ready to scale doesn’t help; and they’re not in the business of dispersion. DARPA only works on programs with a clear defense application so while their idea-limitation does not spell doom for attempts to replicate their success, it does suggest that the ARPA Model has a ceiling on its effective scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_funds_wacky_things_that_go_nowhere&quot;&gt;DARPA funds wacky things that go nowhere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA programs have a 5—10% success rate and have included things like jetpacks, earthworm robots, creating fusion with sound waves, spider-man wall climbing, and bomb detecting bees.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;You can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding&quot;&gt;It is relatively easy for DARPA PMs to re-deploy funding.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA PMs have the ability to pull funding built into contracts with performers, which means that they can quickly move money away from an approach that isn’t working and into an approach that is working. Easily re-deployed funds lower the overhead to starting something risky and differentiate DARPA from other funding agencies, philanthropies, and venture capital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#program_managers_have_the_ability_to_deploy_money_without_much_overhead&quot;&gt;Program Managers have the ability to deploy money without much overhead.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For seedling projects, as long as it’s below roughly $500k program managers can just write a check. In the past, there was almost no oversight over PM spending after the director authorized the money. This is how J.C.R. Licklider was able to “Johnny Appleseed” computing groups all over the country in only a year. Modern program managers need to get approval from their director to write larger checks but that is still fast and low-overhead compared to other funding agencies like the NSF.  The ability to deploy money without much overhead is important for many reasons including making it worthwhile to write smaller checks, opening the door to more collaborators, and just plain moving fast. Small amounts of friction can have big effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;riffing_on_the_arpa_model_mini&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Riffing on the ARPA Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#riffing_on_the_arpa_model&quot;&gt;There are surprisingly few structural riffs on the ARPA Model.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; Often when people compare an organization to DARPA, they just mean that the organization hopes to enable high-risk high-reward use-inspired research. Only a few of these organizations attempt to riff on the ARPA Model’s structure. The US government has built two DARPA imitators: IARPA (the National&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ntelligence Agency’s ARPA)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and ARPA-E (the Department of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nergy’s ARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.) IARPA might be living up to the name – funding both nobel-prize-winning quantum research and controversial forecasting research. ARPA-E has less great results. The British government has floated building an ARPA, but nothing concrete has emerged. In the private sector, Google ATAP is DARPA-esque enough to learn lessons about what not to do from and Wellcome Leap appears to be a full-on health-focused implementation of the ARPA Model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#it’s_easy_to_set_out_to_build_a_darpa_but_end_up_building_a_skunkworks&quot;&gt;It’s easy to set out to build a DARPA but end up building a Skunkworks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dominant paradigm when starting a research organization is to do internalized R&amp;amp;D unless you’re a charitable foundation. In reality, R&amp;amp;D orgs lie on a spectrum between externalized and internalized, with DARPA on one end and Lockheed Skunkworks on the other. There’s nothing inherently wrong with building a Skunkworks –it just means that there are different tradeoffs and the statement “DARPA for X” is misleading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#most_darpa_clones_start_too_big_or_with_heavy_process&quot;&gt;Most DARPA clones start too big or with heavy process.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;DARPA started off small and informal. For years it was less than ten people. Starting big often&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;causes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; heavy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; process –people want assurances in place to make sure their money is spent well.  Starting large with large expectations and scrutiny makes it tough to execute on things that seem stupid. Regardless of size, directly copying all of DARPA’s processes leads nowhere good. Many of the processes were built up over years to fit DARPA’s exact situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;history_mini&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_has_changed_over_time&quot;&gt;DARPA has changed over time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of DARPA’s outlier output happened before APRA became DARPA in 1972 so it’s tempting to throw out anything introduced since 1972 unless it was a codification of a previously implicit rule. However, the world has changed since 1972&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; so it’s worth considering whether some adjustments were made to enable DARPA to more effectively operate in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#arpa_became_darpa_in_1972_because_of_the_increased_scrutiny_on_military_spending_both_in_the_government_and_outside_of_it&quot;&gt;ARPA became DARPA in 1972 because of the increased scrutiny on military spending both in the government and outside of it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html&quot;&gt;Mansfield Amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expressly limited ARPA funding to direct military applications and gave Congress more oversight into their spending. The amendment was part of broader attitude changes towards the military both inside the government and outside of it. Inside the government there was increasing discomfort with how ARPA Program Managers could spend money on basically anything they thought was worthwhile. Unfortunately, you can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution so these constraints reduced the variance of DARPA results, both positive and negative. One might think that the technologies are so broadly applicable that  smart program managers could work on anything under the umbrella of “defense” but from talking to former program managers, there are definitely DARPA-style ideas that DARPA doesn’t pursue because they are not sufficiently defense related.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#was_the_shift_from_arpa_to_darpa_and_changes_over_time_more_of_a_focus_change_or_a_process_change?&quot;&gt;Was the shift from ARPA to DARPA a focus change or a process change?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;process argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is that after 1972 oversight and increased  friction killed DARPA’s ability to create outlier results. The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;focus argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is that we just don’t see or appreciate as many of the things that come out of DARPA because they are specifically for military use and have less broad applicability. The focus vs. process question is important because it determines whether there is anything to be learned from how DARPA works today. The visceral excitement that comes out of (recent) former program managers talking about their time at DARPA suggests that there are many things to be learned from the current organization that is not just cargo culting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt;Upshot: Pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and scrutinize formal process.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the most part there’s been few changes in the weird things about how DARPA’s program managers work compared to other organizations, the incentives and structure of the organization, the funding, and general shape of the process. So it is not worthless to study the modern organization. Regardless of whether or not the changes in formal process are the reason that most of DARPA’s outlier output happened before 1972, they certainly didn’t help. Therefore, if you want to replicate DARPA’s outlier success, it makes sense to pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and for the most part ignore formal process. Formal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;process is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; put into place to increase oversight and decrease reliance on trust. Formal process lets people outside the organization trust in the process instead of the people. Ignoring the formal process makes the success of an organization depend more on trust in people. This trust-dependence means that it is essential for an organization that seeks to replicate DARPA’s success to start with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from funders and collaborators outside the organization. The trust-dependence creates a chicken-and-egg situation –by definition new models and organizations do not have a track record and the people who are most likely to create a new game are ones who haven’t won at other games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;This document  is not meant to be a primer on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; the ARPA Model works or a history of DARPA, although it draws on both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; People have written thousands of words on both&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This document is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; meant to be an unbiased presentation of facts or argue for a general thesis about the world or institutions (though it hints at some.) The goal of this analysis is to acknowledge that DARPA is a massive outlier, figure out which emulatable attributes contributed to its outlier results, and synthesize them with the explicit intention of creating more organizations that can enable more outlier results. More than anything else, this analysis is meant to guide my own action,  not to be tossed into the sea of the Internet for some unknown policy maker to act on (though that would be nifty.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The nature of outliers means that you can’t do a data-based analysis. Perhaps controversially, I think it’s foolish to try to find patterns among outliers because outliers are outliers in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ways except in the most broad strokes. Instead, I dig into the characteristics  that seem distinctive and ask why they might lead to outlier results. At the end of the day, this is storytelling. But stories are powerful. Of course, it’s easy to take this approach too far and create a story about how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;anything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; weird about an outlier contributed to their success: “Steve Jobs only wore one outfit which is important because it allowed him to have EXTREME FOCUS.” I try to avoid the lure of story first by focusing on why the pieces lead to outlier performance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;in combination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;any people who try to replicate outliers fail by picking and choosing the pieces they want to replicate. Second, the goal here is to figure out how to make something that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;works,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; not create a cute theory. I hope that the desire to enable action incentivized me to be intellectually honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Is it foolish to try to replicate outliers? Every outlier is an outlier in a different way, so on its surface it seems like the answer is yes. Concretely, many people have set out to build the next Apple by emphasizing design and perfectionism and fallen flat on their face. People have even tried to replicate DARPA.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iarpa.gov/&quot;&gt;IARPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arpa-e.energy.gov/&quot;&gt;ARPA-E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and others are explicitly modeled on DARPA.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are three mistakes you could make when trying to replicate outliers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cherry picking characteristics without understanding why they’re significant or the magnitude of their effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copying at such an abstract level as to be useless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to clone an organization whole cloth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Instead of trying to copy an outlier exactly or only in broad strokes, the goal should be to deeply understand how it works and then riff on that understanding for your own situation. If it helps, imagine a Jenga tower made up of attributes of the outlier. While not all the attributes are important, many are, in an interconnected way. We need to poke each block and see which ones are structural.  While few people have become outliers by copying other outliers, plenty of outliers have become outliers by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;apprenticing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to other outliers (Ben Graham and Warren Buffet, Edison and Ford, etc.) You could think of an outlier analysis of an organization as a type of organizational apprenticeship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The evidence also suggests that while it’s hard, replicating outlier success is not impossible. IARPA arguably has been reasonably successful –David Wineland’s Nobel prize winning quantum computing work was sponsored by IARPA and I suspect that IARPA is positioned to be to quantum computing what ARPA was to personal computing.  Since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.zhrptighkpj8&quot;&gt; the ARPA execution framework boils down to showing that thing is not impossible, showing that thing is possible, and then making that thing possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the IARPA proof point that riffing on the ARPA Model is not impossible is a good first step.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;I lean heavily on internal linking within this writeup. Partially the links are an attempt to illustrate how interconnected the different components are in order to avoid the cherry-picking failure case. To avoid cargo-culting abstraction I try to explain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;why&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; each component matters, erring on the side of speculation rather than on the side of “just because.” These deep interlinked explanations will hopefully enable myself and others to see where components could be changed to adjust for different applications without copying the whole thing whole cloth and expecting it to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;If you trust me to do the analysis and want to skip straight to the conclusions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#conclusions&quot;&gt; here you go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I heavily linked them as well, so you can just dig into the ones that make you go 🤔&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I play fast and loose with the term “risk” – it’s mostly as a shorthand for “chance of not achieving goals.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Economist Tyler Cowen has a habit of asking guests on his podcast about their “production function” –how do they do the amazing things they do? This is an attempt to distill the DARPA production function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every single description of the ARPA Model agrees that it’s all about the program managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the day the ARPA Model depends on badass program managers which mirrors the obsession with “talent” in other disciplines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;When talking to people about how DARPA works you repeatedly hear “DARPA depends on amazing program managers.” Assuming this isn’t just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.benjaminreinhardt.com/Suitcase_Word&quot;&gt; a suitcase handle word&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (and I suspect it’s not) why is this the case?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs don’t get much structure when they’re designing and executing programs. The closest thing to a  ‘program design framework’ I could tease out of former DARPA PMs is that they r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_‘framework’_darpa_pms_use_to_create_a_program_is_to_mentally_model_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;oughly model the tech council in their heads and organize their activities around answering the questions that ‘model tech council’ would throw at them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As we already noted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases&quot;&gt;, the best DARPA program managers are the ones who can look at an entire literature in an area and notice a systemic bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which involves a very strong ability to think for yourself and go up and down the ladder of abstraction in an unstructured environment. To throw some more suitcase-handle words into the mix PMs need to be good communicators and coordinators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt; because so much of their jobs is building networks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a pattern that the abstract qualities that make “great talent” in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. DARPA PMs strongly pattern match against that description. Two conclusions from that observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The people who would make good DARPA PMs would also make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;people’s motivations for becoming a PM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is important as more precise details about what makes a PM good so you’re not just trying to work with the exact same people as every other high-variance industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When ‘talent’ isn’t code for ‘specialized training’ it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about ‘the ARPA Model’ we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than actually exists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA Program managers pull control and risk away from both researchers and directors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;control&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;PMs pull control away from directors by having only one official checkpoint before launching programs and pull control away from performers through their ability to move money around quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Control over direction and goals lies on a spectrum between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;performers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; —the people actually executing on the research and building with their own two hands – and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;directors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; –the people who run the innovation organization, be it a VC firm or DARPA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;On the performer control end of the spectrum are organizations like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhmi.org/&quot;&gt; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that in essence say “ok performers – here’s a bunch of money – go for it!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, director control looks like NASA’s manned space program where the President has direct input into its direction. (Which is why NASA comes up with a 10 year plan every 8 years.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both ends of the control spectrum can lead to great results in the right situation. Performer control is effective for true exploratory research where you can’t do better than someone with good intuition  playing around. Director control is effective in scenarios like the Apollo Program or Manhattan Project, where you need a massive amount of resources and alignment from wildly different organizations like Congress, academia, the military, and companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In a way DARPA PMs add a second axis to the control spectrum, pulling control away from both the performers and the directors. PMs pull control away from directors by having only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;one official checkpoint before launching the programs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and pull control away from performers through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.1bfcc43kzfd4&quot;&gt;their ability to move money around quickly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It is relatively easy for DARPA PMs to re-deploy funding while it’s hard for someone to pull funding from the program manager. The ARPA Model doesn’t fall neatly into a bucket of “top-down” or “bottom-up” but instead the PMs enable DARPA to do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation&quot;&gt;multiple levels of top-down problem generation and bottom-up solution generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In addition to concentrating control, program managers also concentrate risk. The program manager ideally creates a program where the risk lies in the synthesis of relatively low risk projects. This approach is different from either a normal funding agency or VC portfolio approach where the performers bear the most risk and those risks are aggregated into a portfolio.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;DARPA PMs use seedling projects to ‘acid test’ the riskiest pieces of a program idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so going into the main program, they should be pretty confident that what they’re paying performers to do is possible. Science policy researcher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ideamachinespodcast.com/anna-goldstein&quot;&gt;Anna Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ideamachinespodcast.com/anna-goldstein&quot;&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the organization accepts the risk and the PM takes it on when the director approves a program on the advice of the tech council, not when the program manager gives out a grant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;How well does&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;assuming risk at the level of the program instead of the performer work?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.8m3f38cq2od6&quot;&gt;Know When to Fold ‘Em&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; asserts that only 10% of individual ARPA-E projects are terminated early. That number seems quite low compared to the technically aggressive nature of the programs and while there are no official numbers on program failure rates, it’s undoubtedly much higher than 10%. There are no great ways to compare to grants, but an  NSF program designed to support ‘high risk’ research had a ~10% success rate (where success was defined as producing transformative research.) High project success rates and low program success rates suggests that Program Managers are able to shift risk to the program level. Why does this matter? Shifting the risk from the performers to the program enables DARPA to tackle systemic problems where other models cannot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best DARPA program managers notice systemic biases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“The best program managers can get into the trees and still see the forest.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to former PMs,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;DARPA’s outlier success depends on program managers who have the ability to look at an entire literature of a discipline and notice systemic biases. This essential but vague attribute of program managers is one of the reasons that at the end of the day,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;the ARPA Model depends on having ‘really good’ program managers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luckily this admonition lets us dig into two more precise questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you find people who can uncover systemic biases in a discipline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;How could you systematize finding systemic biases in a discipline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;3 1&quot;&gt;Finding the sort of person who can find systemic biases in a discipline:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You want someone who has demonstrated expertise in a field, but isn’t acknowledged as an expert in that field. If you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ben_Reinhardt/status/1246149991225319424&quot;&gt;divide experts into three categories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; –ones with deep knowledge, ones with a platform, and ones with power,  you want people in the first area who do not overlap with people in the second or third.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alternatively, you could seek out people who are acknowledged experts in a domain but are fringe members or outsiders to the institution of that domain. Find the heretics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You could try to find someone who has a track record of noticing systemic discipline biases. This one feels a little dangerous because in idiosyncratic areas, it feels just as likely that someone who points out problems with everything could just get a few hits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of these attributes mean that PMs will be people who maybe look a bit ‘off’ on paper and emphasizes why it is important that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers&quot;&gt;DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;3 1&quot;&gt;Possible systems for finding systemic biases in an area:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ask seemingly dumb “why” questions about everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make assumptions explicit. Making assumptions explicit is hard because constraints and assumptions are not directly observable in literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It might be possible for an organization hoping to riff on ARPA to build tools that make doing these things easier. This idea is not unprecedented – DARPA itself has a program to enhance program design (metaprogram?) that resulted in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://polyplexus.com&quot;&gt;the Polyplexus project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s directionally correct but leaves a lot of room for improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is focused network building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.f349ma2sznjn&quot;&gt;Rethinking the role of the state in technology development: DARPA and the case for embedded network governance points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;out that DARPA program managers act as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Brokerage-2C-Boundary-Spanning-2C-and-Leadership-in-Open-Innovation-Communities.pdf&quot;&gt;‘brokers’ and ‘boundary spanners’ –terms of art for people who connect relatively unconnected clusters of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. DARPA PMs network in the literal sense of creating networks, not just plugging into them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The idea of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;focused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; networking is important. DARPA program managers have a clear purpose for building the network –first to generate a clear target in an area, then to solicit paths towards the target, and then to make sure that the people who are executing on those paths know about each other so small adjustments to the plan can happen as frictionlessly as possible. It is easy to network in an indeterminate way, hoping that the connections you make will be useful one day. Many people go about networking in this way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;“Networking” is just jargon for ‘building relationships with people who aren’t shoved in front of you by life’ and PMs need to do this at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_darpa_execution_framework_boils_down_to_showing_that_a_vision_is_not_impossible,_showing_that_vision_is_possible,_and_then_making_it_exist&quot;&gt; every step of creating and running a program.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; What does this tactically look like in practice?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In the first step – showing that a thing is not impossible, PMs need to find and become friends with (ideally) everybody who is working on ideas adjacent to the area where they want to have an impact to get a sense of what’s possible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;Realistically, PMs are able to get this access because they bring the possibility of funding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; PMs also bring these people together in small groups to dig into which possibilities are not impossible and what it would take to make them possible. If the PM is doing their job well the people at the workshops won’t already know each other and will continue to poke at ideas together on their own. The second step of the process –showing that a thing is in fact possible – leverages the network built during the first step to quickly do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;seedling projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;During the third step of the process, PMs depend heavily on the network to send unique solutions their way. The PMs host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;performer days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; –small private conference for all the people working on different pieces of the program. These conferences force people to talk about the work they’re doing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they’re doing it, which while uncomfortable, enables people to share solutions to tricky problems and form more connections. You could imagine this leading to problematic correlation between results because everybody would want to copy whatever the shiniest group is doing but at this point all the performers are locked in to whatever approach they’re trying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;You could think of DARPA PMs as playing the role of a manual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.benjaminreinhardt.com/&quot;&gt;designed serendipity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; system. In this role, they both connect the right people at the right time and give them an incentive to help each other out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.vqgkrwy0gxel&quot;&gt;The Dream Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;, M. Mitchell Waldrop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;talks about how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider&quot;&gt;J.C.R. Licklider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; was always flying around to different university groups. In addition to bringing together all the people who thought they were crazy to be interested in human-focused computing, he also helped create several new lab groups. Today, a new professor needs about $1.5m to get going. Interestingly, I haven’t seen any organizations devoted to seeding labs in a structured way beyond funding new professors who would have worked on those ideas anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations –government, academia, startups, and large companies. Connections between different verticals is one way that t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_list_of_changes_over_time&quot;&gt;he DARPA has changed over time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; –in the 1960's, large companies had much more academic R&amp;amp;D arms and startups were barely a thing. By bringing academics, startups and big companies together, modern DARPA PMs are agents of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.gcnqv44rtmr9&quot;&gt;Safi Bahcall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s admonition to “Manage the Transfer not the Technology.” That is, it’s more important to manage the transfer of the technology between different groups and organizations, than it is to make sure that it is created in the first place.  This shift in the PM role is important. Two reasons standing in the way of sci-fi tinged technology that I’ve seen over and over are first: technology that needs actual manufacturing or high capital investment isn’t able to jump the gap from a lab to a startup prototype or from a startup prototype to a real scalably manufactured product and second: many pieces of technology that are amazing but don’t warrant an entire VC backed startup on their own. It seems like building connections between different organization classes while the technology is being built could address both problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a way, the program manager acts like a product manager in a tech company, talking to the customer and modeling their needs. For DARPA the military is the customer but the difference is that the ‘product’ isn’t something that can be purchased (TRL 9) but something that is proved out enough that other branches of the military will scale it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Yes, on its surface this sounds like a platitude, but because so much of the ARPA Model revolves around program managers, it’s worthwhile to dig into&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;why&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the personality traits actually matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;PMs need to think for themselves because at the end of the day, everybody they talk to has only a piece of the puzzle so the PM needs to both put the pieces together and precisely argue for the feasibility of the final picture. When you are surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they’re saying because it’s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking for yourself allows you to avoid these traps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases&quot;&gt;ask questions nobody else is asking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Additionally, the ‘serendipity hatch’ during program execution where there is always an open call for ideas means that a program manager needs to be open to random outside solutions. Many people falsely claim they are curious, but from my direct experience DARPA PMs will have an earnest discussion with people who approach them about the craziest ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Scientists working on DARPA programs usually describe PMs as funding ‘their idea’ in a proud way. At the same time, people looking at a DARPA program from the outside describe the program as clearly the PMs idea. A high ego would lead to a program manager imposing their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation&quot;&gt;top down problems and bottom up solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Unlike most government roles, there are no hard requirements on the sort of people who can be hired to be program managers, to the extent that there are legal provisions in place that let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. This is important because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so you need the ability to get people right when they’re available or work around their constraints. Additionally, the PM’s ability to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_systemic_biases&quot;&gt;notice and call out systematic biases in a discipline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is an attribute that is likely to make them clash with established structures and thus not be as heavily credentialed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Hiring flexibility is also important because the bar for program managers is very high and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_employees_aren’t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be&quot;&gt;the compensation is pretty low for their level of skill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;so it’s just straight up hard to find people who would both be good at and willing to do the job. The only flexibility you have in that situation is on credentials and profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bureaucracies ensure consistency through rules, so there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager. The fact that there are no guard rails makes DARPA extremely dependent on the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players.’ It’s a double edged sword. One reason hiring rules exist is to fight people’s tendency to hire people like themselves. That tendency leads to organizational inbreeding which DARPA has been subject to in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explicitly temporary tours of duty may also be one way that DARPA is able to get amazing PMs where they wouldn’t have been able to otherwise. If you have many options in life, it’s more palatable to go into a position that is explicitly designed around the expectation that you can have maximum impact in a few years and then go do something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transient nature of program managers also makes them more immune to most of the effects of asymmetric career risk because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. They are still subject to the bias of giving grants disproportionately to people they trust. The familiarity bias is what pushes granting committees to give grants to well-established, known researchers. However, my hunch is that biases towards trust and exposure are more solvable problems than worrying about their ability to show that their money was ‘well spent’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Abstractly, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;explicitly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; temporary nature of program managers allows DARPA to maintain alignment with program managers because alignment between people playing different games can happen on finite time scales but rarely on infinite ones. Unlike many organizations there’s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that will be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;People and organizations are all playing some game that has different ways of gaining status and power. Maybe there’s something about PM’s transient nature that doesn’t allow them to play long-term games or figure out how to game them. There’s something to the fact that the program managers are not just transient, but they are transiently&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;changing games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; An academic who becomes a program manager isn’t going to worry about publishing papers. A military officer who becomes a program manager isn’t going to worry about impressing their direct superiors.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa’s_aversion_to_people_with_a_web_presence_may_be_how_they_avoid_asymmetric_career_risk&quot;&gt;Playing a completely different game enables them to focus on the job at hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_transient_nature_of_most_people_at_darpa_enables_ideas_to_be_revisited&quot;&gt;Relatively frequent program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transient nature of program managers was only codified in the ’90s because program managers were sticking around for much longer than five years. This codification suggests that the transient nature of program managers is more than just a historical artifact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speculatively, there’s something about a culture that knows people have an explicitly short tenure that might actually maintain quality. You see this in lab groups, (possibly military units?), and fraternities that maintain the same culture for decades. Intergenerational culture is like a standing wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why do people become DARPA Program managers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;From a career and money standpoint, being a program manager seems pretty rough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; There’s no promotion, no career stability,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_employees_aren’t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be&quot;&gt;you could make more money elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you need to move to Washington DC, and you often don’t get to show off what you did after you’re out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;possible_reasons&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Possible Reasons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;People get frustrated with the incremental/conservative nature of academia. Ben Mann, a former PM cited this as his reason for joining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people. This might suggest that the profile of someone who would be a good PM may be someone who is highly technical but finds VC appealing. Of course, you would need to filter people for whom controlling a lot of money is the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;only reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they’d be interested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patriotism –many PMs see the role as a way to serve their country. Obviously, this option isn’t available for implementations of the ARPA Model that aren’t associated with a single government, but raises the possibility that you could find people who want to serve some cause in the same way that others serve their country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some people may like the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years&quot;&gt; explicitly temporary nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; –it can serve as an exciting, high impact break or pivot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a particular technological vision they want to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small group of peers who will know what you did. Many people are motivated more by the respect of people they respect than by recognition from many people they don’t know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_government’s_influence_on_darpa_is_buffered_by_opacity_and_the_director&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The government’s influence on DARPA is buffered by opacity and the director&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like almost all government agencies, DARPA answers to the executive branch and receives funding from Congress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many parts of the US government that are heavily influenced by term-level timescales. For example NASA comes up with a 10 year plan every 8 years for some weird reason. Several DARPA programs operated from at least 2012 or 2013 to 2020, which means that they successfully crossed administrative boundaries. However, term-scale incentives may have begun to break down – starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential administrations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors&quot;&gt;DARPA Program managers pull control away from both researchers and directors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the Department of Defense itself doesn’t have direct control over which programs DARPA is running. However, the Department of Defense does put pressure on the DARPA director to work on areas that are currently relevant to the military, like counter-terrorism and insurgent warfare in the 2000s or jungle warfare in the early 1970s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An opinionated director is the lynchpin keeping DARPA focused on long-term things that nobody is asking for (yet.) At several points in its history, the director went to bat to keep DARPA from being dissolved or absorbed into the military as a more “normal” R&amp;amp;D organization. This secret meta-dependence on the director makes the increasing politicization of the director potentially detrimental to DARPA and there is evidence that DARPA has shifted away from long-term disruptive work in conjunction with the probable director politicization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Originally Congress funded ARPA through a lump sum but over time has shifted to requiring a budget for each program, including what they plan to accomplish for the year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;. You know this is bullshit because the plans have statements like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“Advance development of design tools for the optimization of collaborative problem solving performance in human-machine systems and systems-of-systems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; In 2003, Congress investigated and effectively defunded the Total Information Awareness Program –an expensive surveillance program riding on the heels of September 11th.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Abstractly, opacity seems important because if your source of money is constantly looking over your shoulder and judging what you’re doing, you’re going to take actions that look good. A source of money like Congress that has many opinions exacerbates the incentive to ‘play it safe’ because making sure any action you take is acceptable to a committee is almost as bad as the committee determining those actions. Decisions made by committees lead to median results. Coincident with Congress digging more into program specifics, more and more DARPA programs are becoming classified. It is complete speculation but it hints at a tension between DARPA’s desire to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt; keep things opaque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and Congress’ desire to have oversight thanks to a trust breakdown possibly tied to increasing politicization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Over time, DARPA has become less opaque and the director has become more coupled to the current administration. If you buy the argument that it’s important to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt; pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; it leads to the conclusion that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.viqjo9z1uop7&quot;&gt;opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and DARPAs director is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Opacity removes incentives to go for easy wins or to avoid being criticized by external forces. Reporting requirements also add friction around everything from hiring to changing direction to trying crazy things to moving quickly and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, opacity can also be abused: getting nothing done, dumping money into stupid projects or unnecessary expenses, giving contracts to performers with whom you have a special relationship, or just straight up stealing. Opacity can be abused in too many ways to list and prevent, which means that a better strategy is to incentivize people not to abuse it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;3 1&quot;&gt;How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse the opacity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat&quot;&gt;DARPA is relatively tiny and flat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; so it’s actually possible for everybody to know everybody. This means that everybody knows what everybody else is up to and the mechanism of peer pressure can come into play to make sure that opacity is not abused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years&quot;&gt;DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;, so they’re out regardless of their performance. In my experience finite tenures either make people want to utterly crush it or not care at all. One way to push for the desire to crush it is simply finding self-motivated people with a lot of integrity who really care about what they’re doing. Of course, this strategy piles even more weight onto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;needing awesome program managers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Another way to motivate people to make the best of a temporary assignment is to enable them to be as effective as possible. The criticality of effective PMs emphasizes how important it is to minimize even small frictions – process can kill effectiveness through a thousand cuts. This observation suggests that overregulation could actually lead to a negative feedback loop of PMs feeling less effective which pushes them to the other end of the behavior spectrum for temporary positions which increases the need for overregulation. Obviously that’s an extreme scenario, but it emphasizes the need for opacity. In a way it’s like a prisoner’s dilemma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nominally venture capitalists are incentivized not to abuse their opacity because of carry. Program managers don’t have that incentive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So put yourself in the situation of a Program Manager: you can’t get promoted, you’re out in five years, nobody will know what you’ve done whether you succeed or fail, and you’re surrounded by people who are complete ballers working on amazing things. You can either sit on your butt and do literally nothing, or go all out and try to make something amazing. There doesn’t seem to be any incentive to either hedge bets or make it look like you’re working when you’re not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The big question then becomes:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;how do you incentivize people to get into that situation in the first place?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Bluntly, the incentives to do amazing deeds once you’re part of the organization do not make a compelling sales pitch to join.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA does multiple levels of top-down problem generation and bottom-up solution generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA completely sidesteps the always-important question “is top-down or bottom up better?” by doing both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In some ways, the program manager is the ‘bottom up’ component. DARPA does an initial pass of top-down when it hires someone. The director or departing PM is usually looking for someone to go after a vague area or problem rather than just hiring someone to fill a slot or because they’re great and they want to have them on staff. The Program manager then proposes a more explicit solution to the high level problem area and gets it signed off by the director.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In other ways the program manager is the ‘top down’ component of top down problems and bottom up solutions. When they are doing initial program design (ie. steps one and two of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_darpa_execution_framework_boils_down_to_showing_that_a_vision_is_not_impossible,_showing_that_vision_is_possible,_and_then_making_it_exist&quot;&gt;show it’s not impossible, show its possible, do it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) they talk to many researchers about possible solutions and solicit project ideas. During the actual execution phase, while they have a plan and an idea of who they want to deliver on it, they still put out a broad call that anybody can respond to at least nominally keep the door open to other bottom up solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_transient_nature_of_most_people_at_darpa_enables_ideas_to_be_revisited&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transient nature of most people at DARPA enables ideas to be revisited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years. Similarly, before 2001, directors did not stick around much longer. Obviously institutional memory lasts longer than any individual but memory of any specific programs dies out quickly because DARPA is relatively tiny and flat so there is only one PM running any program and people pay much more attention to their own work than other people’s. This transient memory about failed programs means less friction around creating a program that ‘has been tried before’ and makes it more likely that DARPA can explore ‘unexploited Leonardo Ideas’ or ‘gems in plain sight’ –ideas that are good but before their time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.ptd3stp98d2l&quot;&gt;A former program manager described&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; how there have been multiple instances of program managers starting successful programs that they discovered later were almost the same as failed programs from the past. If there were enough people around who had seen the failure, the program manager would have had to not just argue for the validity of their program on its own grounds, but address the shadow cast by the failed program. Of course it’s rational to try something that failed in the past as long as you explicitly call out why you will succeed when they failed but small amounts of friction can have large effects. Essentially, the transient memory about specific ideas allows them to be judged on their own merits instead of dealing with baggage from the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It’s entirely possible that short institutional memory about specific programs could lead to people trying terrible ideas over and over again. You see that with certain forms of government, for example. If there are high epistemological standards (enforced by the tech council, informal feedback from other PMs, and the ability to do seedling projects) and there are no externalities to the failure, trying things over and over again has capped downsides. Additionally, the institutional memory is short, but not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; short – you will only get a complete turnover once every ~five years, which is enough time for the constraints in the world to change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;In a way, short institutional memory about programs is like the temporal version of how federated systems like Renaissance Europe prevent disruptive changes from being completely damped out as opposed to centralized systems like Imperial China.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA is relatively tiny and flat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of April 2020, there are 124 staff and three layers. That number is right around Dunbar’s Number –just small enough for one person to know everyone in the organization. It’s not explicitly designed that way but I suspect that it emerged as the right number for the Director to be able to vaguely pay attention to everything that is going on and for everybody in the organization to have vague context on what everybody else is working on. There are three layers – the Director, office directors, and program managers (with a few deputy directors thrown in.) Culturally and physically DARPA is set up so everybody can talk and seek advice, so there is lots of ability for idea cross-pollination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA’s size may help minimize internal politics. The returns to politics is higher at large organizations because there is less direct accountability and any one person doesn’t have a lot of agency to change outcomes. Low potential impact makes it more worthwhile to get people to like you than produce results. On the flipside, in DARPA any program and therefore any program manager can potentially create an industry. The small organization means that there are no “group projects” so every PM is directly responsible for the program they’re working on and you can’t have slackers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;I suspect the small size also helps keep PM quality high. Quality tends to slip when there is both flexibility in who you can hire and there is pressure to hire a lot of people. Since&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers&quot;&gt;the flexibility piece is essential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it becomes important to not have pressure to hire more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The downside of the tiny flat organization is that there don’t seem to be any checks on the Director’s power, so if they don’t like a program or a person they’re out. This is why politicization is dangerous. Politicization would lead to the director prioritizing aligning their goals with factors outside of the organization and PMs aligning with the director more than with the organization’s nominal goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_employees_aren’t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA Employees aren’t paid very much compared to what they could be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2017, a DARPA director is estimated at $76—130k per year and program managers are estimated at $90k. While DARPA does have leeway over salaries compared to the rest of the government, they still can’t offer the same compensation as large tech companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people with the right qualifications could be making much more. Experienced technical PhDs even outside of software engineering can reasonably expect $170k+. Unfortunately, the things that make “great talent” in high variance industries just boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It raises the question –was this more comparable to industry averages in the ’60s? From the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id%3DsyjojInEI1sC%26pg%3DPA151%26lpg%3DPA151%26dq%3Daverage%2Bphd%2Bsalary%2B1960s%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DlibqJ75Acq%26sig%3DACfU3U0x_-Wk8y4KZzIjum7TbaMhNGq3Kg%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D2ahUKEwiev5ax6ZLpAhUBhOAKHUxBAW4Q6AEwDXoECAoQAQ%23v%3Donepage%26q%3Daverage%2520phd%2520salary%25201960s%26f%3Dfalse&quot;&gt;Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; in 1960 a PhD Mathematician in industry could make ~$11,000 and $8,955 in government. That’s $96,000 and $78,000 today. So yes, the gap would appear to be much smaller.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a positive and a negative argument for low pay. The positive argument is that it weeds out people who are just in it for the money and treat the role as ‘just a job.’ On the other hand the negative argument is that the low pay weeds out people who have some lower bound on what they think they’re worth. I can only assume that the widening gap since the ’60s has exacerbated this latter point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The low pay makes the question “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;Why do people become DARPA Program managers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” even more important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa’s_aversion_to_people_with_a_web_presence_may_be_how_they_avoid_asymmetric_career_risk&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA’s aversion to people with a web presence may be how they avoid asymmetric career risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you try to find current and even former DARPA PMs or directors on the Internet you’ll have a hard time. DARPA avoids hiring people with a significant web presence. In the 21st century, that’s remarkable and specific enough that it is worth digging into.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asymmetric career risk happens when you know that the downsides of doing the ’safe’ thing are capped while the downsides of doing the ‘risky’ things are uncapped. Therefore it makes sense that you would be more willing to make risky moves in an institutional context if you know you aren’t going to be judged on your actions either way after you leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with a web presence tend to be focused on playing  status games or at least are in a world where they realize that their career depends on public perception of their output. Internet people are often playing a game to maximize engagement. So being an Internet person could be taken as being a signal that a potential PM would have in the back of their mind “what will other people think about this?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;People are more likely to judge a crazy act positively if they know the reasons why it happened. So if the people you care about are a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.uvzndxpjve&quot;&gt; small group of peers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; rather than the whole Internet it increases incentives to just go for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, less Internet presence means less grand announcements and fewer expectations. If you know it’s easy to shut something down it’s easier to start. Contrast this to something like Peter Diamandis and the X-Prize where there is a huge announcement and massive expectations which can quickly lead to institutional distrust when expectations aren’t met. My impression is that most people don’t take the X-Prize seriously anymore because the ratio of smoke to fire keeps increasing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Of course, it could be more simple and DARPA just doesn’t like people who are too loud because they like to keep things hush hush.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt; Opacity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt; is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt; important to DARPA’s outlier success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But then maybe there is something to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;keeping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; things hush hush. If you keep things hush hush, you don’t have to deal with lock-in from publicly announcing you’re going to do something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_doesn’t_do_any_research_in_house&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA doesn’t do any research in house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;There is a ton of literature on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;DARPA externalizes research, so I want to dig into s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ome subtle advantages of externalizing research:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables DARPA to be relatively tiny and flat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actual cutting edge research may require rare equipment or knowledge. There are many pieces of equipment or tacit knowledge that only exist in one or two places in the world and it’s easier to access them through finite projects than purchasing or hiring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables strong accountability because for any program there is exactly one responsible person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It enables program managers to have multiple teams working on the same objective without internal politics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You don’t have to lay anyone off or find new work for people when you change direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can get people to work on projects who might not want to work for the org full time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course there are also disadvantages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are higher transaction costs in making sure deliverables are created, finding the right people in the first place, paying administrative overhead at the other org, and convincing them to work on projects. Coasian tradeoffs everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA doesn’t have any control over the ‘intellectual exhaust’ created during projects, which means that they both can’t do direct technology dissemination and they do not capture the value it creates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It’s easy to conflate ARPA with Bell Labs, Lockheed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Skunkworks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or Xerox PARC but they’re fundamentally different because R&amp;amp;D orgs lie on a spectrum between externalized and internalized and DARPA is all the way on the externalized end, while those other orgs are much closer to the internalized end. A common trap for people claiming to replicate DARPA is internalizing the majority of their work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA has many tight feedback loops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;From day one there is a feedback loop between a new program manager and the other program managers. ‘Onboarding’ at DARPA is an informal process that involves mostly oral traditions and shadowing. Informal onboarding is normally a no-no when it comes to best practices but most organizations don’t limit themselves to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat&quot;&gt; Dunbar’s number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Program managers get significant informal feedback from other PMs as they hone their program design. This feedback includes whether something is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.usnn8cmycivu&quot;&gt;‘in scope’ for the organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and whether the design is precise enough. High quality informal feedback depends on other PMs actually caring, so this is another reason DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are multiple levels of feedback loop between the PM and the research community during program design. The tightest loop is informal conversations with individual researchers and groups about where they see blockers and possibilities in the area that the PM can then incorporate into their program design. The PM then uses workshops to set up feedback loops between those possibilities – an idea might be good but an enthusiastic proponent could gloss over a major hole that needs to be filled. Finally, small projects test the riskiest parts of those possibilities against the world before the PM incorporates them into the program design.  The workshops also set up feedback loops between previously unconnected groups of researchers focused on the program area that hopefully create new ideas and (ideally) new research communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs also set up feedback loops between different parts of an industry –academia, startups, and big companies. Setting up these feedback loops with researchers across&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;a discipline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is why&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt;a large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt;focused network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt; building.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Feedback loops enable a PM to adjust, kill, or start projects as necessary during the execution of the program. Frequent contact with performers working on a project enables both the performer and the PM to incorporate new information into decisions on whether they should make small adjustments to the project’s goals and how that propagates into the rest of the program. PMs also use this information to decide whether t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding&quot;&gt;o kill the project completely or start a new one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Failed projects are also part of a feedback loop:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“The failure (of a performer) triggers a discussion in which the first question is whether the goals were correctly specified and how they might be redefined in the light of the research that has already taken place.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ARPA Model also uses long-term feedback loops to maintain high quality PMs and research collaborations. A players hire A players and B players hire C players so high quality program managers make other high quality program managers want to join. Low friction interactions with DARPA and funding that enables performers to do things they wouldn’t be able to do otherwise keeps ideas coming from the community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Even PM hiring is part of a feedback loop between the organization and the outside world. PMs are hired to explore a specific area that DARPA wants to explore. Even though it works on technology that nobody knows they need yet, DARPA needs to be responsive to changes in the world – whether it’s new possibilities (technology push) or new needs (technology pull.)  This buffering between the outside world and hiring is one of the ways DARPAs director is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_is_~0.5%_of_the_department_of_defense_budget_and_~12%_of_that_is_basic_research&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA is ~0.5% of the Department of Defense Budget and ~12% of that is basic research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A lot of DARPA’s budget is spent on actually assembling weapons and vehicle systems. So the math works out that only ~$400m is actually being spent on ‘basic research.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These raw numbers raise two questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it essential that a research organization is a small fraction of the money factory’s budget? That is, can an outlier producing organization only exist as a small attachment to a bigger organization? You see this pattern repeated over and over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is there a ‘minimum effective budget’ to generate outlier results? If so, what is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_is_more_ideas_limited_than_money_limited&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA is more ideas limited than money limited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;From&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.ortsg8etkn0w&quot;&gt;What makes DARPA tick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“I never really felt constrained by money,” (former DARPA director) Tether says. “I was more constrained by ideas.” In fact, aerospace engineer Verne (Larry) Lynn, DARPA’s director from 1995 to 1998, says he successfully lobbied Congress to shrink his budget after the Clinton administration had boosted it to “dangerous levels” to finance a short-lived technology reinvestment program. “When an organization becomes bigger, it becomes more bureaucratic,” Lynn told an interviewer in 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Let’s just take a moment to stand in awe of this 😮)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both the explicit desire to avoid bureaucracy and the low marginal benefit of money and people is another reason why&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.uvzndxpjve&quot;&gt;DARPA’s small size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is DARPA more ideas limited than money limited?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;At any time there are only so many ideas in the world that fall into the sweet spot of just hitting an inflection point on an s-curve –having enough potential that a concerted effort will get them to a take off trajectory but not so obvious that everyone is piling resources into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost by definition, the more of a Big H hard problem it is  (ie. one that needs a breakthrough instead of just more engineering effort) the less throwing money at it will help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike startups, DARPA is not in the business of dispersion. When you have something that scales, by definition more money = more results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Something about the idea marketplace for ideas – once people realize that something is a good idea, DARPA money is less useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;VC firms experience a similar effect –they tend to have lower percent returns as funds get bigger even though they *are* in the business of scaling things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Presumably DARPA also has a lower bound on effective funding. What might that be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_funds_wacky_things_that_go_nowhere&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA funds wacky things that go nowhere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many DARPA programs that don’t go anywhere and sometimes sound stupid in retrospect. This list is meant to show how wacky some of the programs sound, especially in “Explain it like I’m Five English.” Because you can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution, funding these wacky things is essential to getting outlier results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sonofusion – creating fusion through sound waves. (was so wacky they actually were investigated for wasting money)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Central nervous system interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bomb detecting bees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;program_managers_have_the_ability_to_deploy_money_without_much_overhead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Program Managers have the ability to deploy money without much overhead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;seedling projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as long as it’s below roughly $500k program managers can just write a check.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern program managers need to get approval from their director to write larger grants and they need to work through official government vehicles like open grant calls and government websites. 😭 However, the PM is the only person reading the grant proposals and they don’t need to check with anybody before deploying the money once it’s been allocated. This process is still fast compared to other funding agencies like the NSF where there is literally a committee that deliberates over grant applications. Even large companies or universities require you to submit a request before spending a large chunk of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past there was almost no oversight over PM spending after the director authorized the money. This is how J.C.R. Licklider was able to “Johnny Appleseed” computing groups all over the country in only a year. The transition from ARPA to DARPA was coupled to more oversight on military spending, which inevitably introduced more overhead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The ability to deploy money without much overhead is important for many reasons including making it worthwhile to write smaller checks, opening the door to more collaborators, and just plain moving fast. If it is an equal amount of pain for the PM to write a check regardless of size and the same amount of pain for a performer to apply for any amount of money, there will be some threshold below which the money is not worth the effort. Small amounts of friction can have large effects! High overhead means only larger projects will happen. Larger projects take more time and are more serious, so if all projects were large it would kill two critical pieces for getting to breakthroughs:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops&quot;&gt;feedback loops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and play. High-overhead, formal grant applications weed out many potentially useful collaborations such as people who don’t understand how the grant process works or who are terrible at writing grants (both of which are unrelated to their ability to do good work.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The ability to move quickly is important because often the money is going towards keeping the lights on or a grad student in the lab, so if an organization can’t get the money quickly they are going to work on a different project and become unavailable even if the money is available later. Fast money allows a PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding&quot;&gt;to quickly act on new information and adjust the trajectory of the program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; which can make it more likely to succeed. There is also something intangible about the feeling of ‘momentum’ that you can’t get if you have to constantly go over road bumps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Of course, the ability to deploy money quickly requires high trust in both the PM’s integrity and their judgement. Restrictions on spending money happen when you reach trust limits. Overhead exists for a rational reason –money can be embezzled and people always spend money for a purpose so whoever is providing the money wants to know that it is being well-spent. Yet another reason why it circles back to “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;you need to have really awesome PMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is relatively easy for DARPA PMs to re-deploy funding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;DARPA PMs have the ability to pull funding built into contracts with performers, which means that they can quickly move money away from an approach that isn’t working and into an approach that is working. You would expect people to be hesitant to work on something risky if they know that the funding could be pulled quickly.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.8m3f38cq2od6&quot;&gt;Anna Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pointed out that the actual pieces of the programs are less risky, because within a project the goals can shift.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors&quot;&gt;Instead the PMs take on the risk of the entire program failing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not clear whether easy fund-pulling was always part of DARPA or if it was introduced as part of formal process around deliverables. However, it seems worth considering part of the ARPA Model and replicating for two reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;First, it makes sense that easily re-deployed funds would increase willingness for funding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_funds_wacky_things_that_go_nowhere&quot;&gt;wacky things that might go nowhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; because if you know it’s easy to shut something down it’s easier to start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Second, it increases the contrast between DARPA and other institutions that give out money like pure grant-giving orgs and venture capital. Organizations that give out long-term grants like the National Science Foundation or Howard Hughes Medical Institute need to either very carefully consider proposals which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;leads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to death by committee or lean on trust in a researcher’s experience. Either way, it slices out a large amount of idea-space. Venture capitalists write checks that are meant to fund a company for 18 months or more. This timescale means that they can end up with a lot of sunk cost in a company that is clearly not doing well. That possibility rationally leads to more risk aversion and when it inevitably happens it can burn time and resources trying to help the struggling company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mechanically, DARPA sets up easily-redeployed funding by using contracts instead of grants for most research and having goals in the contracts that are almost impossible to hit. If the performer doesn’t hit the goal, it is at the PMs discretion whether to cancel the contract.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_darpa_execution_framework_boils_down_to_showing_that_a_vision_is_not_impossible,_showing_that_vision_is_possible,_and_then_making_it_exist&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The DARPA execution framework boils down to showing that a vision is not impossible, showing that vision is possible, and then making it exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Executing on this framework is different for every case, which is why&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;PMs need to be extremely competent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, able to t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego&quot;&gt;hink for themselves, and trustworthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. However, it’s still worth going a few rungs down&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction&quot;&gt;The Ladder of Abstraction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; into what this means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1._show_that_the_thing_is_not_impossible&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Show that the thing is not impossible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of this step, a PM should have a concrete vision of where the world could go, evidence that ‘on paper’ it doesn’t violate known physics, and a precise list of experiments you would want to do before putting it in front of the tech council and subjecting it to the Heilmeier catechism.  J.C.R Licklider’s “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html&quot;&gt;Man-Computer Symbiosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;” is the classic example of a concrete vision.  Tactically, PMs get to this point by first talking to researchers in a domain about what they’re working on and start to synthesize possibilities into a vision of where the domain could go. They also get small groups of researchers together to hone ideas against each other and figure out where the key constraints lie. Massive constraints imposed by the laws of physics can kill the program right there, but if there is uncertainty that can be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;tested and resolved for a few hundred $K the PM will do that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2._show_that_thing_is_possible&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Show that thing is possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of this step, a PM should have demonstration-based evidence that creating the vision is possible and a roadmap for how to get there. The evidence and roadmap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#the_‘framework’_darpa_pms_use_to_create_a_program_is_to_mentally_model_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;needs to hold up to scrutiny by well-intentioned experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Tactically, PMs get to this point by bringing together small groups of researchers to map out precisely what the pieces of the puzzle look like, which are the most risky, and where the unknowns are, what experiments could be done to resolve the biggest risks. They figure out where you can’t get more precision without experiment and do those experiments as part of seedling projects. The PM  lays out where the biggest blockers are along the roadmap and figure out the different approaches that you could take to remove the same blockers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3._make_thing_possible&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Make thing possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where the PM spends the majority of the time and money in the program and can potentially last through the tenure of multiple program managers. During this step PMs fund different groups to work on different pieces and approaches for the problem. The PM makes sure that the groups working on different pieces are communicating through both formal and informal channels to minimize getting stuck and maximize new ideas. The PMs adjust frequently, killing approaches that aren’t working and reroute funds to new approaches that come up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_initial_exploratory_tranche_of_a_darpa_program_is_approximately_$1.5m&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial exploratory tranche of a DARPA program is approximately $1.5m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of this money goes towards small &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;seedling projects&lt;/span&gt;. These seedling projects are small grants or contracts designed to help solidify that an idea is both not impossible and that it is in fact possible within scope. Intriguingly, this is in the same ballpark as a large seed round for a startup or the amount of money you need to set up a lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_‘framework’_darpa_pms_use_to_create_a_program_is_to_mentally_model_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ‘framework’ DARPA PMs use to create a program is to mentally model the tech council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;According to PMs I’ve grilled on this question, the closest thing to a framework that PMs use to guide program design is “be able to explain precisely why this idea will work to a group of really smart experts both in the area of the program and adjacent to it.” In short, PMs design a program against a mental model of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;Tech Council.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount of risk the council is willing to give a thumbs-up on depends heavily on the office and its role. The Defense Science Office is much more risk tolerant than the Tactical Technology Office for example.  The Tactical Technology Office actually builds prototypes and passes them off to the military, while the Defense Science Office works on more speculative projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops&quot;&gt;informal feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; throughout the program design process on whether the program is likely to be approved by the council. It’s key that this feedback is from people who are good models of the council as opposed to schmucks with an opinion, which is the case with advice in many other disciplines. I suspect this zero-consequence but tight feedback loop during the design process is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;While the framework doesn’t have much structure, it does give PMs a very fixed end goal – answering&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.z3zi0hfoi0ff&quot;&gt;The Heilmeier Catechism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The testament to the usefulness of The Catechism despite the fact that it wasn’t created until&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; DARPA had many of its early wins makes me suspect that it is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt;formalization of previous informal processes and is worth paying attention to.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The unstructured framework depends on DARPA PMs being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego&quot;&gt; smart and self motivated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;because there is almost no explicit guidance and the feedback loop depends on self-motivation. Yet another reason&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;‘awesome PMs’ is a bedrock for the whole system.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every program at DARPA is intensely technically scrutinized by the tech council&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Tech Council&lt;/span&gt; is composed of people with technical expertise in the proposed program’s area and adjacent areas. The Tech Council Pitch Meeting is meant to be very high level but council members can ask deep technical questions on anything.  The tech council doesn’t have any power besides advising the director on the program’s technical soundness. A purely advisory tech council seems like a good idea because it both avoids decision by committee and keeps all responsibility squarely on the director and PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;PMs should have ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;derisked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;’ the idea before going into the meeting by using seedling projects, workshops, and precise roadmapping.  The way the tech council meeting was described to me is that it’s roughly like a university seminar in a room full of people who you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;cannot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; bullshit and who have enough technical experience to dig into anything about the program.  It’s important that the meeting be egoless and clearly focused on making the program as good as possible because this sort of thing can easily go down a rabbit hole if people feel the need to show how smart they are or just destroy the presenter. The need for the tech council to ‘get it’ suggests that it should be composed of other PMs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_‘acid_test’_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA PMs use seedling projects to ‘acid test’ the riskiest pieces of a program idea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Seedlings are 3—9 month projects that cost  $0.05M to $1M and are designed to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“Move concepts from ‘disbelief ’ to ‘mere doubt’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This means that in an initial exploratory tranche that costs approximately $1.5m, you expect to run roughly a dozen seedlings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is little oversight on the money spent on seedling projects as long as the budget is less than ~$500k. PMs don’t need to get the money pre-approved and unlike larger and later projects, DARPA PMs don’t have to use open solicitations for seedlings. In essence the PM can go to whoever they want and say “I need this done.” Zero oversight enables them to move extremely fast. Restrictions on spending money happen when you reach trust limits, so this low-oversight spending is another reason why DARPA depends on high trust in badass PMs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Seedlings are not about finding a solution to a problem, they’re designed to verify or disprove a hypothesis. The idea for seedlings can either come from the Program Manager or from a performer. Either way the ideas are part of a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops&quot;&gt;feedback loop between the PM and the research community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; during program design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_facilitates_cross-polination_both_between_pms_and_performers&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA facilitates cross-polination both between PMs and Performers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Everybody at DARPA has deep experience in some technical area and there is a culture of people dropping by and asking each other about the subject of their expertise. The way a former PM described this atmosphere was weirdly similar to the one attributed to Bell Labs at its peak. The culture also encourages PMs to discuss their programs with other PMs. This cultural artifact is special because it would be easy for everybody to mind their own business as everybody is working on their own programs. It would also be easy for PMs to feel competitive. DARPA’s small size probably helps walk this fine line between PMs not caring about what other people are working on and caring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;too much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; I’ve read some accounts that disagree with this description of DARPA culture, instead portraying a situation with little interactions between PMs. I attribute the discrepancy to the culture being different either in different offices or at different times because I put higher weight on the description I heard directly from talking to former PMs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Performers who get DARPA funding are required to share research with each other at various closed-door workshops. Since they are all presumably working on different aspects of the same problem, this seems valuable. The sharing has some of the aspects of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/&quot;&gt;open science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; but among a much more focused group of people. Ideally, the closed-door workshops bring together the people who might benefit from the knowledge and keep out the tourists and hangers on that can destroy nascent communities. The forced early sharing stands in contrast to normal academia where everything is a first-to-the-post system that incentivizes people to pipet out information to their peers because they are (rationally) worried about getting scooped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_provides_a_derisking_role_for_people_in_other_organizations&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA provides a derisking role for people in other organizations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA derisks working on breakthrough ideas for three big groups: researchers, companies, and other funders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;DARPA obviously derisks whether researchers will be able to get funding to work on an idea. Researchers don’t have as much uncertainty around grant proposals because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#program_managers_have_the_ability_to_deploy_money_without_much_overhead&quot;&gt;program managers have the ability to deploy money without much overhead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Instead of the common situation where a funder says “that sounds great! But I need to check with my boss/our budget doesn’t allow it,” if a PM says “that sounds great” it probably means that you’ll get funding. The ability to plan is a big deal. PMs also derisk working off the beaten path for researchers more subtly by building a community around a technological vision. The community is secretly critical because the peer review and citation system incentivizes people to work on things that other people think is interesting. So even if an academic could get funding to work on crazy shit, most people wouldn’t work on it because they wouldn’t be able to get the results published and cited. By&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot;&gt;bootstrapping a community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the PM gives researchers peers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;DARPA derisks working off the beaten path for small companies by giving them more confidence that there will be customers for their product –either large companies or the government. In the best case, the promise of future procurement functions like a prize to incentivize startups to spend their own money on top of the money from DARPA. Startups building ‘frontier tech’ often falter at the stage where they need to scale up production.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;By encouraging small companies to work with large companies earlier in the process, DARPA PMs reduce scale-up risk as well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this way DARPA PMs act in a similar way to biotech VCs, brokering relationships between small companies with specialized skills and large companies with production capacity. Additionally, other customers often see DARPA funding as third-party validation of a startup’s technology. The DARPA validation can be critical for breaking the chicken-and-egg that nobody will buy your product until someone has bought your product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;From a founder:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“DARPA funding has the added benefit of communicating to a third party a validation of the technology.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For large companies, the off-the-balance sheet work to show that an idea is feasible and clear evidence of demand derisks the idea to the point that they’re willing to start spending their own R&amp;amp;D dollars on it. Companies want R&amp;amp;D to be off of their balance sheets as much as possible. For example, DARPA worked with IBM and Intel to develop nanophotonics and afterward the companies took them on as R&amp;amp;D programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“So the DARPA piece, while large, was the validation for IBM to spend their own money.” He continues, “The same way for the Intel piece. You know, Intel certainly looked at that project, and then Intel ended up funding it internally, but the fact that DARPA went back to them three and four times and said, this is an important thing, this is an important thing, you know, it got to the board of directors, and it got high enough that they set up a division to do this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Most grant-giving organizations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;try to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;derisk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; them as much as possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;. Previous DARPA funding can give research groups the funding they need to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;derisk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a key part of the technology enough that they can get follow-on funding from more risk-averse grant-giving organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a professor: &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“Once you’ve gotten funding from DARPA, you have an issue resolved, and so on, then you go right ahead and submit an NSF proposal. By which time your ideas are known out there, people know you, you’ve published a paper or two. And then guys at NSF say, yeah, yeah, this is a good thing.” He continues, distinguishing DARPA’s place within the broader U.S. government system, “NSF funding usually comes in a second wave. DARPA provides initial funding.” As a consequence, he concludes, “DARPA plays a huge role in selecting key ideas” (from among the broader set of ideas present in the research community).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;DARPA analyses can end up looking like hagiographies – this document is no exception. Clearly DARPA has downsides. Instead of caveating every conclusion, it seems productive to group problems thematically and use those groupings to suggest places where an organization using the ARPA Model may be able to improve on the original.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa’s_primary_purpose_is_to_develop_military_technology&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA’s primary purpose is to develop military technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The D in DARPA stands for “Defense” –ultimately DARPA’s explicit purpose is to support the DoD. Even before the addition of “D” ARPA was mission-oriented around the military. at the same time as J.C.R. Licklider was sowing the seeds of personal computing and the Internet, William Godel was managing ARPA programs to build silent planes and boats, agent orange, and AR-15 rifles. Even J.C.R. Licklider’s computer work was started in response to an incident where the US almost started a nuclear exchange because a computer couldn’t tell the difference between the Moon and a fleet of incoming bombers combined with JFK’s desire to have a better command-and-control overview of the US military. For the most part, the non-military technology that came out of DARPA was a happy byproduct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While we can abstract the ARPA Model away from DARPA’s military focus, it is important to keep that focus in mind because in the long run incentives win and at the end of the day, innovation organizations that are misaligned with their funding source are either neutered or destroyed. Aspects of the parent organization leaks into any innovation organization’s focus regardless of any commitment to paradigm-shifting long-term work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The military milieu of the day has always driven DARPA’s focus: Vietnam, the Cold War, concerns about offshoring eliminating US ability to build its own military technology, and terrorism. DARPA is the source of many technologies that the show Black Mirror has used to paint dystopian futures – killer drones, surveillance AI, walking robots, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see this focus leak in ARPA-E, the Department of Energy (DOE)’s ARPA riff. The DOE doesn’t really have one straightforward mission – it used to be “ensure nuclear superiority” (historical sidenote – all the DOE national labs were originally established to optimize and advance different parts of the nuclear weapons process.) ARPA-E is similarly a bit confused – is it trying to lower the cost of energy? Shift us to renewables faster? Help the energy industry or upend it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Two upshots. First, DARPA’s military focus means that there are ideas that are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;out of scope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A former PM explicitly confirmed that while DARPA is ideas limited, there are ideas well-suited for the ARPA Model that DARPA doesn’t pursue. Second, the source of authority and funding matters for anybody attempting to riff on the ARPA Model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_arpa_model_is_high-variance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ARPA Model is high-variance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same mechanisms that enable an organization to move quickly and work on weird, paradigm-shifting programs can also enable massive waste and fraud. The parallel stories of J.C.R. Licklider and William Godel illustrate both edges of the sword. Both men were ARPA program managers in the ’60s. Both had precise, grand visions of technology that could change the world. Both had unmonitored access to funds once the DARPA director gave the ok. But while  Licklider helped midwife modern computing and computer science as a field, Godel helped unleash ineffective chemical atrocity on Vietnam, laid the groundwork for the security state, and was arrested by the FBI and convicted for embezzlement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experience of working with ARPA is also high variance. Both first and second-hand experience confirms that sometimes DARPA is an amazing partner and sometimes it is hair-tearingly frustrating. Sometimes you come in expecting someone like Licklider and you get something closer to a standard government bureaucracy. Perhaps here is a place where you could actually improve on the model with the modern ‘innovation’ of customer obsession – high quality programs depend on continued relationships with high quality performers, so being a pleasure to work with should be paramount.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uncomfortably, the ARPA Model’s high variance is a case where you can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution. Any guard rails would slow down the process or constrain PMs, reducing both possible downsides and potential massive upsides. It is unsatisfying but the only solution that doesn’t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs is “culture and good people.” Acknowledging this fact directly enables everybody in an organization riffing on the ARPA Model to look the potential downsides straight in the eye. “With great power comes great responsibility” is a great adage for program managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_falls_into_many_classic_government_organization_traps&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA falls into many classic government organization traps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA doesn’t always stick to the ‘ideal’ APRA framework that others and I normally describe. DARPA programs can also look much more like a normal government R&amp;amp;D program – the military needs something, so they tell the director to start a program around the idea. The director finds a program manager to execute on the idea. The program manager ends up looking much more like a project manager with very little input over the direction of the program at all. This way of doing things seems relatively rare and happens more in the military-systems prototype focused offices (TTO and DSO) than elsewhere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;While DARPA has been granted some exceptions to broad government rules around hiring and how they can spend money, DARPA is still subject to many ‘stupid government rules.’ They aren’t allowed to use Google Docs or Zoom regardless of how un-sensitive information is. Modern DARPA still requires grants to go through the official government grant application website. The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.sam.gov/opp/059d8cd9eda40b8ae04ed843732d0b6e/view%23general&quot;&gt;grant application page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is almost tear-inducing. Cold contacting a PM requires filling out a web form that then sends a note to the PM’s secretary who may or may not set up a time for you to talk to the PM a month out. I can only imagine this friction reduces the number of serendipitous ideas PM’s receive. The IARPA, the National Intelligence Agency’s ARPA organization, puts emails directly on the website so ‘it’s to prevent too many emails’ is not a valid excuse. From personal experience, at least some DARPA employees treat the weekend as sacred no-work-email time regardless of urgency – a behavior I associate with large bureaucracies where people have little stake in outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And at the end of the day politics still sneaks in. The biggest example of this were the changes in 1972 thanks to shifting views on the military as a consequence of Vietnam. Throughout DARPA’s history, new presidents have occasionally replaced the DARPA director and starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential administrations, which suggests increasing politics over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_arpa_model_can_lead_to_inbreeding&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ARPA Model can lead to inbreeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The path of least resistance when you’re hiring is to hire people you know, and people tend to know people like themselves. This human tendency, combined with hiring flexibility means that DARPA tends to bring people on as program managers who are already in the DAPRA sphere – researchers who work on government projects, military personnel, and generally “Washington DC people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;One consequence of insularity is that, from personal experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, there is a significant cultural gap between DARPA and Silicon Valley. This gap includes legal organizational structures, the expectations of funders, the importance of storytelling, communication style, and more. Since venture capital and startups are an increasingly important technology dispersion mechanism, the culture gap impairs DARPA’s ability to effectively transfer technology. To be explicit: my point isn’t to criticize DARPA for not having more of a ‘startup culture’, but to illustrate that cultural insularity can impede technology dispersion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cultural inbreeding can also impede DARPA’s ability to work with the best possible performers. While ideally program managers can cast a dragnet that puts their program on the radar of everybody who might be able to contribute, in reality many people who might be able to contribute are totally unaware. The announcements are still mostly picked up by people in the DARPA “sphere.” I have personal experience with this gap – I was working on technology for manipulating an uncooperative satellite at literally the same time that DARPA was running a program to capture and repurpose satellites and didn’t hear about it until after the grant calls had closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is also a fine line between ‘working with people you trust for the sake of expediency’ and ‘giving money to your buddies even if they aren’t the best ones for the job.’ Although PMs have definitely gone over this line – the Total Information Awareness program poured money into a consulting firm run by the PMs former colleagues – DARPA has managed to remain shockingly scandal free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A riff on the ARPA Model could possibly address the potential inbreeding problem explicitly putting in effort to seek out weirdos and people from ‘different worlds.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darpa_has_a_mixed_record_on_transitioning&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA has a mixed record on transitioning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;ARPA Model has the explicit intention that technologies get out of the lab and into the real world. Clearly DARPA has successfully transitioned paradigm-changing technology to the government, large companies, and startups, so the model’s design isn’t worthless. However, many DARPA technologies still fall into ‘The Valley of Death’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and even successful transitions often are not smooth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA’s history pockmarked with stories that go “and then at the end of the program, the military or industry said ‘that’s cool, but we like the way we do it now.’” Or perhaps worse, they say ‘that looks great’ and take ownership of the technology but then completely stop working on scaling it up. In some of these cases the outside organizations come around: DARPA funded the development of UAVs in the ’80s, the Navy took on and then killed the program, DARPA continued development until the military paradigm shifted in the ’90s. The story is similar for optoelectronics. While counterfactuals are hard, these common ‘near death’ stories suggest that there are many programs that vaporized on impact with existing paradigms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each transition failure, like unhappy families, is unique. Some of the failure modes do rhyme:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The technology is great, but it both doesn’t slot well into a product line at a big company and investors can’t see how it could lead to a massively valued company in less than a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people who worked on the technology are great researchers but terrible entrepreneurs. The skills that make you good at seeking+executing on government projects can be quite disjoint from the skills that make you good at building and selling a product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pieces of the program don’t come together in one place. Each project in a program is a piece of a puzzle and most of the time they’re far more valuable together than on their own – a mouse isn’t much use without a GUI. For maximum impact, those pieces eventually need a single home after the program ends. Personal computing was such a success story in part because as ARPA took its foot off of the gas pedal, Richard Taylor was able to bring the pieces in-house at PARC. Speculatively, bringing the pieces together may have become harder because the Bayh-Dole act enabled universities to extract licensing fees on research they created with government money, potentially bleeding dry anybody who wants to license from multiple universities who each want their cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA often works on ideas that nobody thinks they want. A program can fail to address the core reason why there’s no demand. In a way, DARPA programs are like cave dives – you want to get somewhere that requires you to decouple from safety/the market but you need to get somewhere with oxygen/demand in a finite amount of time. You can miscalculate where you need to end up or the target can move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA works on programs that go against the established paradigm. Changing paradigms might endanger someone’s job or just be more work than any advocate is willing to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of these failure modes illustrate the tension between ‘building something people want’ and ‘building something capable of shifting paradigms.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Transitions are an area where an organization riffing on the ARPA Model may be able to make big improvements over DARPA. It is important to first acknowledge that DARPA doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The mechanisms for technology dispersion at its disposal are subject to the constraints of the world around it. In the 1970s that meant large corporations like Xerox, defense contractors, or government labs. The constraints on those organizations have shifted, and VC-backed startups have become an important mechanism as well. DARPA has worked to adjust to this new environment – going so far as to create a commercialization team in 2017. But from personal experience the adjustment has been clunky. I don’t have a great answer yet, but it’s important to ask “what would an organization built from the ground up with transitions into today (or tomorrow’s) environment in mind look like?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;When talking about riffs on the ARPA Model, it’s important to distinguish between organizations that spiritually riff on the ARPA Model and structurally riff on it. Spiritual riffs (or just spiritual rhymes) are organizations that have enabled or strived to enable high-risk, possibly paradigm changing, goal-focused research. People often conflate DARPA with great R&amp;amp;D organizations of the past – Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, Lockheed Skunkworks, and others. It doesn’t help that DARPA funded and helped organize research at all of these places. While I am all for being spiritually inspired by DARPA, we’re digging into the hypothesis that DARPA’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is worth riffing on, so I’m going to ignore organizations that fall into this category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To my knowledge, there haven’t been any attempts to structurally riff on DARPA before the latter half of the ’00s. This timing is intriguing in itself, and a pure speculation is that it is the consequence of a dawning realization that something wasn’t working in the research pipeline. But that is another story for another time. Evaluating these ARPA rifflings as successes or failures is difficult, given that they are all younger than 13 years old, ARPA style programs usually take five or more years to produce a result (and often much longer to have an impact), and the expected success rate is 5—10 programs out of every 100. I will touch on whether they ‘feel’ success-y, but primarily we should focus on the deviations they have made from the standard ARPA Model, whether they make sense in context, and whether we would expect the deltas to lead to more success or failure over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are surprisingly few attempts to riff on the ARPA Model. The US government has built two DARPA imitators: IARPA and ARPA-E. The British government has floated building an ARPA. In the private sector, Google ATAP is DARPA-esque enough to talk about and Wellcome Leap appears to be a full-on health-focused implementation of the ARPA Model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iarpa:_intelligence_arpa&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA: Intelligence ARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I(ntelligence)ARPA started operation in 2007 and is run by the Department of National Intelligence. It currently has 17 program managers as of 2020, which makes it roughly the size of one of DARPA’s six offices. At first glance, it has all the pieces of the ARPA Model: empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;differences_from_darpa&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Differences from DARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;IARPA explicitly does&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; commercialization – all technology transfers are to intelligence agencies. This stands in contrast to DARPA which transfers to large companies and the VC/Startup Ecosystem as well as DoD agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA spends around a quarter of its budget on testing and validation of the technology that comes out of its programs. Given IARPA’s focus on computer security and computation in general, this spending both makes sense and is intriguing. What would a focus on testing and validation look like for other technologies? One failure mode for technology trying to leave the lab is extreme fragility (only working in ideal situations, etc.) and a validation mechanism might cost more in the short term but lead to more robust technology in the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA uses contests and tournaments as a first-class tool for generating research. DARPA has run a few tournaments which arguably were significant successes – the grand challenge and the urban challenge catalyzed a phase change in autonomous driving from a research novelty to a potential industry. The DARPA robotics challenge was disappointing, but ⅔ is great for high-risk programs. Despite the outlier results, DARPA tournaments are the exception, not the rule. The reasons for this difference aren’t clear – it may be that computing-based tournaments are easier to coordinate and standardize or it simply comes down to a matter of culture. Several economists have pointed out that prizes are underused as a research funding mechanism and when I’ve directly asked DARPA PMs why they don’t use prize mechanisms more often the answer was “I don’t know.” IARPA’s regular use of tournaments, DARPA’s infrequent but high impact tournaments, and missing evidence to the contrary suggests that prizes may be a useful place for an organization riffing on the ARPA Model to explore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Surprisingly IARPA is much&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;less&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; sensitive about its research than DARPA. Most of IARPAs programs are unclassified, in contrast to ~1/3 of DARPA programs that are classified. IARPA also funds organizations outside the US. It seems useful to  tap into as many resources as possible so my hunch is that this is a useful change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA has a policy of making sure there is a potential intelligence agency ‘customer’ before undertaking a program. While this seems well-intentioned, it means that IARPA will never be able to change a paradigm unless an intelligence agency already feels like it should be changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;iarpa’s_results&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;&gt;IARPA’s Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA has 37 ongoing programs and 26 completed programs as of mid 2020. At a 10% success rate, there’s a 95% chance that at least one of them would have succeeded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IARPA funded a significant chunk of quantum computing research in the US in the 2007-2010 period, including David Wineland’s research that went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics in 2012. It’s not completely roses though – IARPA cut off funding to NIST researchers, including Wineland, because they didn’t want to fund other government organizations. It’s not clear if they resumed that funding or are claiming credit for the Nobel prize research that they funded and then cut off …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“As of 2009, IARPA was said to provide a large portion of quantum computing funding resources in the United States.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Has IARPA started any industries yet? No, but if quantum computing becomes as big a deal as people think it could be, I suspect IARPA will play a large role in the stories about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;Not serious note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;. Look&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;at this list of IARPA program names and rejoice ye LoTR and Mythology nerds: Ithildin, MAEGLIN, SIMARILS, Amon-Hen, Odin, ATHENA, ICArUS, Mercury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arpa-e:_arpa-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA-E: ARPA-Energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA-E(nergy) started operation in 2009 and is run by the Department of Energy. It currently has 20 program managers and a budget of ~$180M as of 2020. That makes it approximately the size of one DARPA office. Like IARPA, it has all the pieces of the ARPA Model on paper: empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;differences_from_darpa&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Differences from DARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;ARPA-E is on the opposite end of the transfer spectrum from IARPA: while IARPA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; hands off technology to its funding departments, ARPA-E primarily targets private companies to adopt and scale up its program’s output (DARPA does both.) Transfer via commercialization makes sense given that the Department of Energy doesn’t actually build or deploy energy technology. ARPA-E adapted the ARPA Model to target commercialization in several ways: it has a whole commercialization team; on-staff lawyers; and explicitly considers how the technology is going to be implemented by the energy industry before embarking on a program. While these adaptations are logical, they may be shooting the ARPA Model in the foot. The additional apparatus around commercialization makes ARPA-E less flat than DARPA – there are more non-PM staff than PMs, which cuts into the benefits of DARPA being tiny and flat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While DARPA is funded by congress as part of the DOE budget, the DOE funds ARPA-E programs directly. Direct program funding means that the DOE has much more say over which programs ARPA-E runs and how they spend money. This subtle difference in funding sources make ARPA-E less independent from the DOE and may invalidate the buffer between the government political machine and DARPA provided by opacity and its director. Since ARPA-E is targeting transfer to non-DOE entities, the increased DOE oversight may lead to one of those lovely situations where an entity with no skin-in-the-game has a large say on risky activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA-E is explicitly metrics-driven. While this approach certainly jives with modern sensibilities, my hunch is that metrics can hamstring embryonic technology. Metrics are great when you know what you’re optimizing, but tend to cause the streetlight effect – you optimize for things that can be measured. Do you know what you’re optimizing when you’re still figuring out how a technology works and what it is good for? What would Licklider’s metrics have been for a personal computing program? It is possible that energy has so few relevant metrics that a metrics-driven approach doesn’t cut down on trying weird things, but I’m skeptical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA-E is not process-light. I have heard first hand accounts of inflexibility around hiring “despite most of the work being in different parts of the country, you must be full time and in Washington or you will not be invited to all the meetings” and tools “you must use the government issued laptop for everything.” This inflexibility goes against the conclusions that  you should pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal process and that DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most reports about ARPA-E’s impact stress the number of projects they have funded and concrete outcomes are conspicuously absent. It feels like a dog-that-didn’t-bark type situation. The closest to an outlier result was funding the research that led to a solar-cell company named 1366 hitting 19.6% efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA-E is also operating in a brutal area: the energy industry is notoriously conservative partially because it is behooven to many stakeholders: various kinds of investors, governments, customers, and non-customer residents in the areas where the energy company operates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Many&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; countries have a military R&amp;amp;D organization that reporters occasionally refer to as “The DARPA of X” (for example Israel’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.mod.gov.il/About/Innovative_Strength/Pages/Directorate-_of_Defense_Research_Development.aspx&quot;&gt;DDR&amp;amp;D: Directorate of Defense Research &amp;amp; Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; or Singapore’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dsta.gov.sg/home&quot;&gt;Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.) These organizations do work on advanced military technology but run their own labs and have the military as a more direct customer which makes them closer to Lockheed Skunkworks than DARPA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;google_atap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google ATAP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regina Dugan, a former DARPA Director, explicitly organized Google Advanced Technology And Projects (ATAP) to riff on DARPA’s structure. ATAP does high-risk high-reward program-focused research that isn’t afraid to explore new phenomena but leaves out empowered program managers and externalized research. These two missing components make it hard to consider it a true riff on DARPA. It’s much more akin to a skunkworks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wellcome_leap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wellcome Leap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wellcome fund – a British foundation dedicated to funding health research – announced a new division called Leap in May 2020. From the scant information available online, Wellcome Leap seems to be organized around empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research. From what I can tell, this is the closest a private entity has come to the platonic ARPA Model, at least on paper. There are reasons for both optimism and skepticism about its potential outcomes. Its CEO, Regina Dugan, is a former DARPA director (who incidentally started Google ATAP.) Leap is nominally acknowledging that its programs will take time to come to fruition and have a high chance of failure. Hopefully, the things it has going for it will not be impeded by starting too big: it has a large ($300m) pool of money from day one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;british_arpa&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;British ARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;As of mid-2020 there has been a lot of talk about a British ARPA but not much apparent action. Dominic Cummings, Chief Advisor to the British Prime Minister, has written about a British ARPA many times and the Queen’s speech at the end of 2019 featured the idea. Many people have weighed in online and the government is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://committees.parliament.uk/submission/%23/evidence/119/preamble&quot;&gt;soliciting information about how it might work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That may be a red flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;for an organization based on the idea of individual empowerment and non-consensus approaches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it’s_easy_to_set_out_to_build_a_darpa_but_end_up_building_a_skunkworks&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s easy to set out to build a DARPA but end up building a Skunkworks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dominant paradigm of starting an org is to do internalized R&amp;amp;D unless you’re a government or charitable foundation. In reality, R&amp;amp;D orgs lie on a spectrum between externalized and internalized, with DARPA on one end and Lockheed Skunkworks on the other. Externalized research entails working through grants and contracts while internalized research is doing everything in house. There’s nothing inherently wrong with building a Skunkworks – it just means that there are different tradeoffs and the statement “DARPA for X” is misleading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;most_darpa_clones_start_too_big_or_with_heavy_process&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most DARPA clones start too big or with heavy process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA started off small and informal. For years it was less than ten people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Starting too big often&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;causes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; heavy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; process. People always spend money for a purpose, so the more money there is up front, the more expectations there are attached to it. One failure mode is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that funding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; entity doesn’t trust a low-track record organization and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;requires heavy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; process to create assurance that the money will be well-spent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Starting large makes opacity hard, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa’s_outlier_success&quot;&gt;opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Starting large with large expectations and scrutiny makes it tough to execute on things that seem stupid. A spotlight also encourages organizations to work on things that seem sexy which makes it hard to generate true outlier output. Remember: if you know it’s easy to shut something down it’s easier to start and the opposite is true as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Culture and trust takes time to build. A large organization either needs culture and trust or process to keep everybody aligned so if you start big&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;without&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; heavy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; process it will just lead to a shitshow. As far as I can tell, this point and the previous one is roughly what happened with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atap.google.com/&quot;&gt; Google ATAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Regardless of size, directly copying all of DARPA’s processes leads nowhere good. Many of the processes were built up over years to fit DARPA’s exact situation, and as noted earlier, you should&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt;pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal processes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“There is not and should not be a singular answer on ‘what is DARPA’—and if someone tells you that [there is], they don’t understand DARPA”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—Richard Van Atta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It’s important to lay the changes out and discuss whether or not they affected the change in DARPA’s outlier output. Interestingly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.wcw854220kx7&quot;&gt;the majority of DARPA’s changes over time have involved adding more explicit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.wcw854220kx7&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The biggest change happened when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.ht0crpsgybs4&quot;&gt;ARPA became DARPA in 1972 because of the increased scrutiny on military spending both in the government and outside of it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Which raises the question: “was the shift from ARPA to DARPA a focus change or a process change?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It’s tempting to throw out anything introduced since 1972 unless it was a codification of a previously implicit rule. However, the world has changed since 1972&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; so it’s worth considering whether some adjustments were made to enable DARPA to more effectively operate in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;most_of_darpa’s_outlier_output_happened_before_1972&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of DARPA’s outlier output happened before 1972&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The first elephant in the room is DARPA’s history. Just looking at the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html&quot;&gt;DARPA “best hits” timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  for wildly impactful technologies, the difference before and after 1972 is pretty stark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;8 1&quot;&gt;Before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#arpa_became_darpa_in_1972_because_of_the_increased_scrutiny_on_military_spending_both_in_the_government_and_outside_of_it&quot;&gt;ARPA became DARPA in 1972&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;3 1&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Miniaturized GPS receivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;It raises the question of whether there is anything to be learned from the modern organization or whether we need to go completely off of historical accounts.  Some of the post 1972 creations are still pretty significant – both autonomous cars and voice technology arguably haven’t reached their potential yet. Additionally, we can attribute a chunk of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;perceived&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;outlier dropoff to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.pu4d0eqyiwjo&quot;&gt;DARPA’s Congressional mandate to focus on things with clear military applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While DARPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.3nnrp1l5173&quot;&gt; has changed over time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, most of the changes were changes in official process so if we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.x6gae4h2l211&quot;&gt;pay more attention to informal process than formal process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,  there are still valuable things to be learned from post-1972 DARPA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arpa_became_darpa_in_1972_because_of_the_increased_scrutiny_on_military_spending_both_in_the_government_and_outside_of_it&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARPA became DARPA in 1972 because of the increased scrutiny on military spending both in the government and outside of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html&quot;&gt;Mansfield Amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; expressly limited ARPA funding to direct military applications and gave Congress more oversight into their spending. The amendment was part of broader attitude changes both inside the government and outside of it. Inside the government there was increasing discomfort with how ARPA Program Managers could spend money on basically anything they thought was worthwhile. Unfortunately, you can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution so these constraints definitely reduced the variance of DARPA results, both positive and negative. One might think that the technologies are so broadly applicable that  smart program managers could work on anything under the umbrella of ‘defense’ but from talking to former program managers, there are definitely DARPA-style ideas that DARPA doesn’t pursue because they are not sufficiently defense related.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The economy also tanked in 1973, which contributed to Congress being  more concerned about what they were getting for their money.  They didn’t want program managers like J.C.R. Licklider prancing around spending money that didn’t have a clear payoff. This historical note emphasizes the point that to pull off long term projects, innovation orgs need to be aligned with their money factory so that they’re not dependent on fair weather funding – sources of money that flow only when the economy is good or they’re working on something popular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Outside the government, popular opinion turned against the military in the early 1970s, which both put pressure on elected officials and changed attitudes towards working with ARPA. The change in opinion made university researchers more hesitant to take military money.  It also may have made fewer high quality people want to join the org, which arguably probably persists now. The stigma around working for the military puts additional weight on the question of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?&quot;&gt;why do people become DARPA Program manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a_list_of_changes_over_time&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A list of changes over time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some time before 1993 DARPA shifted to a formal  three phase development system.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Let’s ignore this as a formalized process change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Heilmeier Catechism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; was introduced in 1975, so it did not contribute to any of the output in the ’60s or early ’70s. In fact,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.rki39dmnx711&quot;&gt;Dominic Cummings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; attributes the decline in output to its structure and an implied focus on results. There are arguments both ways. Many explicit DARPA rules like transient program managers are just codifications of previous implicit rules so the catechism may have been an informal rule of thumb test. Additionally, Heilmeier himself was an engineer who discovered phenomena that enabled liquid crystal displays so he presumably understood the process of true invention and discovery. On the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; hand, he worked on planning for McNamara so he very much bought into a top-down mentality.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I’m on the fence about whether to pay attention to this one – it seems like it could be useful as a thinking framework as long as it isn’t used as a bludgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, DARPA managers do go/nogo checks every few months on performers. Program managers used to exert less explicit oversight over performers.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.1bfc3kzfd4&quot;&gt;I suspect that the ability to move money quickly away from things that aren’t working is important though.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1960s DARPA program managers didn’t do open solicitations for grants through an official government system – they just gave money to whom they wanted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This is pure formal oversight.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1960s it wasn’t official policy that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years&quot;&gt;DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  but the official policy was just a codification of the informal rules when Program Managers started hanging around too long.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;While technically it’s addition process, this is just a codification of an informal rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council&quot;&gt;every program at DARPA is intensely technically scrutinized by the tech council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that then advises the director on whether to approve it. In the 1960s the process was a quick meeting between the Program Manager and the director laying out what they wanted to do.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This one is tricky – from conversations with program managers, the Tech Council sounds useful because it enables a clear goal for PMs without restricting what they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2001 DARPA changed who can be a prime contractor from anybody (including research labs and startups) to only large companies.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This one is also tricky –&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#id.f349ma2sznjn&quot;&gt;Rethinking the role of the state in technology development: DARPA and the case for embedded network governance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; makes the argument that this is an adjustment for the fact that Corporate R&amp;amp;D has declined and it’s hard for startups to get products into production so one of DARPAs new roles is almost as a systems manager. This change may be worth paying attention to as a way that DARPA has adjusted to a changing world in a smart way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential administrations. This suggests that there’s been a shift in the politicization of the organization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Verdict:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Obviously this seems bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together these raise the question ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;was_the_shift_from_arpa_to_darpa_and_changes_over_time_more_of_a_focus_change_or_a_process_change?&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Was the shift from ARPA to DARPA and changes over time more of a focus change or a process change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transition from ARPA to DARPA involved both a focus change to explicitly military projects and more formal process and oversight. Since most of DARPA’s outlier output happened before 1972 the shift raises the question of whether the output dropoff  was more a function of the change in DARPA’s process or its focus. There are arguments for both ends of the spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;process argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is that after 1972 oversight and increased  friction killed DARPA’s ability to create outlier results. Both increased demand that programs have a waiting customer and increased spending scrutiny embodied by things like The Heilmeier Catechism and the Tech Council  hamstrings program managers. This argument definitely has merit because small amounts of friction can have large effects and you can’t cut off just one tail of a distribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;focus argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is that we just don’t see or appreciate as many of the things that come out of DARPA because they are specifically for military use and have less broad applicability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The focus vs. process question is important because it determines whether there is anything to be learned from how DARPA works today. If the changes in process that occurred after 1972 are the direct cause of the drop-off in outlier output, then analyzing the DARPA process today is worthless. If the focus shift caused the drop-off in outlier output, lessons from today’s DARPA remain valuable. In reality, it is probably a mix of both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;The visceral excitement that comes out of (recent) former program managers when I’ve talked to them about their time at DARPA suggests that there are many things to be learned from the current organization that is not just cargo culting. At the same time, the majority of changes to DARPA over time have involved adding more explicit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. How can we resolve these two ideas? I would suggest that the solution is to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt;pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal process.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;One non-focus, non-process reason for the change in outlier output  may be that DARPA can’t attract as many amazing people because they have better options or don’t want to work on explicitly military things. If this were the case, it would severely affect output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;because the ARPA Model is so heavily dependent on great PMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. However, there are still super high quality people in DARPA so this cannot explain all the changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pay_attention_to_darpa’s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;For the most part there’s been few changes in the weird things about how DARPA’s program managers work compared to other organizations, the incentives and structure of the organization, the funding, and general shape of the process. So it is not worthless to study the modern organization. Regardless of whether or not the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_list_of_changes_over_time&quot;&gt;changes in formal process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;are the reason that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#most_of_darpa’s_outlier_output_happened_before_1972&quot;&gt;most of DARPA’s outlier output happened before 1972&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they certainly didn’t help. Therefore, if you want to replicate DARPA’s outlier success, it makes sense to pay attention to DARPA’s informal process and ignore formal process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;Usually, formal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;process is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; put into place to increase oversight and decrease reliance on trust. Formal process lets people outside the organization trust in the process instead of the people. Ignoring the formal process makes the success of an organization depend more on trust in people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt;This trust-dependence means that it is essential for an organization that seeks to replicate DARPA’s success to start with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;trust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; 1&quot;&gt; from funders and collaborators outside the organization. The trust-dependence creates a chicken-and-egg situation because by definition new models and organizations do not have a track record and the people who are most likely to create a new game are ones who haven’t won at other games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis opens many questions – especially about different knobs and what happens when you turn them. Here are some of the most pressing to mind, though there are many others.
&lt;h2&gt;Where is the pareto front between externalized and internalized research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_doesn’t_do_any_research_in_house&quot;&gt;DARPA doesn’t do any research in house&lt;/a&gt;, which has several advantages. However even in the domain of mission-focused research examples like Lockheed Skunkworks, Bell Labs, and others have demonstrated that internalized research can produce excellent results and has clear advantages. Internalized research lowers some set of transaction costs, enables closer collaboration between disciplines, smooths transition to manufacturing, and makes capturing value easier. The fact that internalized vs. externalized work is not a binary distinction but a spectrum complicates the situation. My hunch is that there is some class of work where the advantages of externalized research dominate and another class of work where the advantages of internalized research dominate. I don’t have a good answer to where that line is, but it is an important question to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it essential that a research org is a small fraction of the money factory’s budget?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_~0.5%25_of_the_department_of_defense_budget_and_~12%25_of_that_is_basic_research&quot;&gt;DARPA is a small fraction of the Department of Defense Budget.&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, other storied research organizations tend to be attached to large ‘money factories’ and represent a small fraction of their budget—at its height, Bell Labs’ budget was only 5% of AT&amp;amp;T’s revenue. By contrast, my sense is that even well-capitalized independent research-focused organizations feel constant pressure that can impede long-term research efforts. Now, plenty of corporate labs produce nothing of note, so being attached to a larger money-making organization is certainly not sufficient for producing long term results. It’s important to understand whether that money factory is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why doesn’t ARPA use prizes instead of grants outside of a few challenges?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prizes seem like they could be a natural fit with the ARPA Model, yet DARPA doesn’t seem to use prizes outside of a few examples like the DARPA Grand Challenges and Robotics Challenges. Specifically, prizes seem like they’re just one more path along the theme of &lt;a href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation&quot; class=&quot;internal-link&quot;&gt;top down problems and bottom up solutions&lt;/a&gt; beyond open solicitations and parallel projects. IARPA’s heavy use of competitions suggests that the question is worth asking. One prize-dissuading possibility could be that most DARPA projects are more capital-heavy than IARPA’s mostly computer-based-projects and capital requirements would make people hesitant to work towards an uncertain payout. Another possibility is simply tradition and government rules. It’s worth knowing whether it’s the former, the latter, or something else if you’re going to riff on the ARPA Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a minimum effective budget for the ARPA Model to work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful big things usually start small and &lt;a href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#most_darpa_clones_start_too_big_or_with_heavy_process&quot; class=&quot;internal-link&quot;&gt;many attempts to replicate DARPA’s results start too big&lt;/a&gt;. So it makes sense to ask: can you start with a tenth of DARPA’s budget? A hundredth? A thousandth? There are two lower budget bounds that you’ll run into: the number of parallel high-risk programs you need to run to get a success and the budget per program to have a viable shot at that success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A back of the envelope calculation suggests that if each program generously has a 10% chance of success then you need to run at least seven programs to give yourself a 50% chance of at least one program being successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of minimum program budget is trickier. Let’s look at some comparison numbers. In the years 2018–2020 among DARPA programs not focused on assembly and production the minimum budget was $2m, the maximum budget was $31.4m, and the average budget was $12m. The ARPA IPTO directorate that midwifed the personal computer started with a budget of $47m in 2020 dollars. ARPA-E vacillates between ~$200–300m/year and has about 50 programs running at any time, which comes out to roughly $4–6m per program. IARPA’s budget is classified. Could a program go below a couple million dollars a year and still be effective? There are arguments both ways. On one hand you could argue that surely bureaucratic inefficiency is pushing those budgets higher than they need to be. On the other hand, it might be that the sort of work most valuable for an organization riffing on the ARPA Model to undertake needs a relatively large budget, otherwise it would be picked up by other funding mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How could the ARPA Model take advantage of the Internet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager’s_job_is_focused_network_building&quot; class=&quot;internal-link&quot;&gt;A large part of a DARPA program manager’s job is focused network building&lt;/a&gt; and the Internet is one of the greatest network building tools of all time. However, DARPA doesn’t have a strong web presence and the idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa’s_aversion_to_people_with_a_web_presence_may_be_how_they_avoid_asymmetric_career_risk&quot; class=&quot;internal-link&quot;&gt;DARPA’s aversion to people with a web presence may be how they avoid asymmetric career risk&lt;/a&gt; suggests that there are good reasons for the low Internet utilization. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://polyplexus.com&quot;&gt;the Polyplexus project&lt;/a&gt;, a DARPA effort to foster an idea-generating online community, suggests that DARPA may realize that it’s no longer at the pareto front of this tradeoff and that it might be able to more effectively use the Internet to execute on its model. The Internet could conceivably help PMs find people working on the edge of a space, foster communication between performers, and find gaps in the state of the art. What would a riff on the ARPA Model built to take advantage of the Internet look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;8&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;dvanced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;8&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;esearch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;8&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rojects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;8&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gency model is of an organization set up to maximize the agency and effectiveness of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_“talent”_in_other_disciplines&quot;&gt;world-class program managers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (PMs) who coordinate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_doesn’t_do_any_research_in_house&quot;&gt;external research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to midwife technology that wouldn’t otherwise happen (Programs.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DARPA provides a critical ‘in-between’ role in the world. It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_facilitates_cross-polination_both_between_pms_and_performers&quot;&gt;facilitates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cross-polination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and derisks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_funds_wacky_things_that_go_nowhere&quot;&gt;wacky ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for both&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.yvdiicrjxis6&quot;&gt;private, academic, and government organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of interlocking pieces is huge but this breakdown should give you hope – none of these admonitions are magical or depend on irreplaceable configurations of people in time. Riffing on DARPA will be incredibly hard. ‘DARPA hard, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I noted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;internal-link&quot; href=&quot;https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#h.29p4exze5lg2&quot;&gt;at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the entire point of this document is to inform action. This is not the place for a deep dive on what those actions could and should be but I wanted to leave you with some sketchy questions and considerations for replicating DARPA’s outlier success that I plan to tackle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first question, of course: “is it worthwhile to riff on the ARPA Model?” Yes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;It’s notable that in conversations with former PMs, they explicitly noted that there are many program ideas that are shelved (and often forgotten) because they fall outside of DARPA’s military-focused scope. If anything we need it now more than ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does an ARPA need to be a government organization? Is it possible to create a private ARPA? Nothing suggests that it’s impossible, but there are several pieces that need to be figured out first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;3 1&quot;&gt;Some uncomfortable truths:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot; 9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anybody attempting to riff on the ARPA Model needs to be willing to sit with a lot of discomfort for a long time – the best ARPA programs often take a decade or more to come to fruition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can’t be in it for short term glory. Opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success so the industry standard flashy announcements about what you’re going to do are off the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will need to work on things&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they’re sexy. The whole point of the organization is to make unsexy things sexy, not hop on the latest hype train.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attempting to replicate DARPA-style successes may involve doing several things that go against Silicon Valley dogma:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Value capture might be really hard or impossible. Externalized research does seem structural to the model and value capture primarily happens on work done inside an organization. The role of DARPA as an in-between thing feels weirdly important – again this is awkward for value capture. This also suggests that riffs on ARPA probably will not look a normal fund or startup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot; 2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Planning is important and might suggest resurrecting the dark art of systems management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot; 9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is the awkward tradeoff between the need to start small and the fact that there may be a minimum size to pull it off successfully. You could imagine a situation where you start small and just do program design for a few programs and once that is done, you use those designed programs to bring in the money to execute on them. However, that would put the organization in a position to be judged on unsexy and weird programs. It would hamstring the ability to quickly begin executing. One of the reasons companies and researchers are willing to engage with PMs seriously so early in the process is that they know the PMs are ‘good for it.’  Maybe there’s a tranched solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big consideration for anybody hoping to emulate DARPA’s success outside of a government agency is the question of ‘how will money work?’ The ideal situation would be for the organization to be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;its own&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; money factory, but it might be impossible to accomplish that while preserving the structurally important pieces of the ARPA Model. Another huge consideration is how to set up incentives both to work with high quality PMs and for potential performers in big companies, small companies, and academia to take you seriously. These considerations suggest that replicating ARPA’s success outside of a government might require truly new organizational structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are also exciting places where it may be possible to riff on the model. Building more structured roadmapping frameworks could make program design even more effective. You might be able to build trust during the program design period by having potential PMs do a ‘residency’ instead of making an upfront binary decision. It’s even possible that program design and execution could be decoupled. You could seed even more awesome if another organization is willing to execute on the program after it’s been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;derisked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; by showing that it is both not impossible and is in fact possible. These are just a few of the possibilities!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;If you want to work with me on the second step,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bzreinhardt@gmail.com&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;or just&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://parpa.substack.com/p/coming-soon?r=1nemc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&quot;&gt;stay in the loop.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pseudorandom.com&lt;/code&gt; — I explore several sophisticated approximation techniques for implementing the exponential function, $f(x) = e^x$, including Taylor series approximation, Lagrange interpolation, Chebyshev interpolation, Carathéodory-Fejer approximation and MiniMax approximation. This also serves as a more general introduction to the use of these methods for approximating other functions. In the process I walk through the relevant theory for each method and apply numerical analysis to navigate various forms of error. I also include my own Python and C++ implementations of each algorithm in double precision11: Note that the implementations included here will both output and calculate in double precision. We can still apply sophisticated methods in this setting, but as a general rule you’ll need higher interme... &lt;strong class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23671262&quot;&gt;IMPLEMENTING&lt;/a&gt;, 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;By: Juan Linietsky &lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Jun 28, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As work progresses on Godot 4.0 at a steady pace, a new and novel method of creating full-scene global illumination has been added in the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SDFGI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDFGI stands for Signed Distance Field Global Illumination. It means this technique makes heavy use of Signed Distance Fields (an euclidean distance based representation of the signed distance function of a grid) to create this lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://godotengine.org/storage/app/uploads/public/5ef/897/537/5ef897537bd2e627064094.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;rtgi2.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While implementation is not final, and there will probably be many improvements to quality and performance, it seems to be good enough for general use now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank hugely Matias Goldberg for his enormous help on this, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/godotengine&quot;&gt;patrons&lt;/a&gt; for their continued support, and Tim Sweeney and Epic Games for their confidence in helping us finance our research via Epic Megagrant. This new technique was developed entirely in the open and implemented under MIT license, so anyone can take it for using in their own engines and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What it can do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDGFI is something akin to a dynamic real-time lightmap (but it does not requiere unwrapping, nor does it use textures). It's enabled and it automatically works by generating global illumination for static objects. It &lt;strong&gt;does not require raytracing&lt;/strong&gt;, and it runs in most current (and some years old) dedicated GPUs, &lt;strong&gt;even medium-end budget CPUs from some years ago&lt;/strong&gt; (SDFGI was developed and tested on a Geforce 1060, running always at 60fps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light changes &lt;strong&gt;are real-time&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning any change in lighting conditions will result in an &lt;strong&gt;immediate update&lt;/strong&gt;. Dynamic objects are supported only for receiving light from the environment, but they don't contribute to lighting. Some degree of support is planned for this eventually, but not immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDFGI also supports specular reflections, &lt;strong&gt;both sharp and rough&lt;/strong&gt;, so full PBR scenes should &quot;just work&quot;. In the image below you can see both of them in checkerboard roughness texture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://godotengine.org/storage/app/uploads/public/5ef/897/88d/5ef89788d937a898536731.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;rtgi4.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emissive lighting is also supported, so materials with emission channel &lt;strong&gt;will fully work with SDFGI&lt;/strong&gt;, providing lighting to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://godotengine.org/storage/app/uploads/public/5ef/897/ea2/5ef897ea2c026417781991.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;rtgi5.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDFGI is mostly leak free, unlike VCT techniques which are the most common in use today (like SVOGI/GIProbe/etc). As long as walls are thicker than a voxel for a given cascade, light won't go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you use it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure your meshes are marked as &quot;Static Bake&quot;, then enable SDFGI in the Environment settings. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some options to customize SDFGI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cell size: Shows the base cell size of the nearest cascade. Each further away cascade duplicates the size, allowing very large view distances that support global illumination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Bounces: Enable a feedback loop, which simulates multiple bounce lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occlusion: Generates occlusion information between the probes, to avoid light leaks in walls. Occlusion generally works well, but you must ensure that walls are thicker than a voxel at the cascade they are rendering to in order to avoid light leaks. It has a small cost when enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read Skylight: Allow sky to contribute to lighting/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y Scale: Trades horizontal detail for horizontal range. This is very useful for scenes with interiors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some new debug modes to visualize how SDFGI is working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SDFGI Cascades: Show the world as SDF, helps you understand what voxel sizes are, so you adjust your geometry to work better with those voxel sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDFGI Probes: Shows where probes are (only near cascade for now), helps you understand where your geometry is reading lighting from. If an areas has less probe density, it may get wrong occlusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will write an article about this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>How we got our AWS bill to around 2% of revenue</title>
<link>https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/our-aws-bill-is-2-of-revenue-heres-how-we-did-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/our-aws-bill-is-2-of-revenue-heres-how-we-did-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Server cost is usually not a concern for most funded startups, but for a boot strapped SaaS product like ours,  it was important to have an AWS bill that is easy on the pocket and a little more proportional to the MRR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end when we started &lt;a href=&quot;http://superlemon.xyz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superlemon.xyz&lt;/a&gt; one of the first things I did was to find ways to consume the least amount of resources on the cloud. We currently serve a traffic of ~ 250 requests per second with our AWS setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications require certain common cloud resources and these include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compute instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDN &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web server that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now go through each of these resources and talk about both the expensive way and the cheap way to implement them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compute instances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to compute instances, most people go with AWS EC2 instances. EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Lightsail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
EC2 dashboard
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database instances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Database restoration from recent backup
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caching instances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is &lt;a href=&quot;http://prometheus.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prometheus.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Shopify CDN that is free of cost

&lt;p&gt;There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS file to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web server + load balancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serving static files for our application dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://amplify.nginx.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amplify.nginx.com&lt;/a&gt; for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us. This may not work for big organisations or products where the traffic is erratic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup will also not work for folks who have a ton of stuff to do already and would prefer to use managed services and not take the additional headache of monitoring, maintaining and provisioning hardware resources on a regular basis because this has a time cost to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a team of 2 people with a product that is not computation heavy and has cloud requirements that are quite straightforward. We have been running this product for a little over 1 year with this AWS setup and so far we have not encountered any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://roamresearch.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt;, built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you're free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I use Foam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam/raw/master/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Second Brain&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate&quot;&gt;Create a single &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; workspace&lt;/a&gt; for all your knowledge and research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them &lt;strong&gt;Bubbles&lt;/strong&gt;, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Foam's shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with &lt;code&gt;[[wiki-links]]&lt;/code&gt;, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an overview of your &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; workspace using a [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/graph-visualisation&quot; title=&quot;Graph visualisation&quot;&gt;graph-visualisation&lt;/a&gt;] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/backlinking&quot; title=&quot;Backlinking&quot;&gt;backlinking&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foam is a like a bathtub: &lt;em&gt;What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in a Foam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the soapy suds it's named after, &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is mostly air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The editing experience of &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/recommended-extensions&quot; title=&quot;Recommended Extensions&quot;&gt;recommended-extensions&lt;/a&gt;] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like &lt;a href=&quot;http://netlify.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact&lt;/strong&gt;: This documentation was researched, written and published using &lt;strong&gt;Foam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>It&amp;#039;s time to take alternatives to dark matter seriously</title>
<link>https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-time-to-take-alternatives-to-dark-matter-seriously</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-time-to-take-alternatives-to-dark-matter-seriously</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the American astronomer Vera Rubin puzzled over her observations of the sprawling Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way’s biggest neighbour. As she mapped out the rotating spiral arms of the stars through spectra that she and colleagues had carefully measured at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Lowell Observatory, both in Arizona, she noticed something strange: the stars in the galaxy’s outskirts seemed to be orbiting far too fast. So fast that she’d expect them to escape Andromeda and fling out into the heavens beyond. Yet the whirling stars stayed in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1970ApJ...159..379R&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, which she expanded to dozens of other spiral galaxies, led to a dramatic dilemma: either there was much more matter out there, dark and hidden from sight but holding the galaxies together with its gravitational pull, or gravity somehow works very differently on the vast scale of a galaxy than scientists previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her influential discovery never earned Rubin a Nobel Prize, but scientists began looking for signs of dark matter everywhere, around stars and gas clouds and among the largest structures in the galaxies in the Universe. By the 1970s, the astrophysicist Simon White at the University of Cambridge &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978MNRAS.183..341W/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that he could explain the conglomerations of galaxies with a model in which most of the Universe’s matter is dark, far outnumbering all the atoms in all the stars in the sky. In the following decade, White and others built on that research by simulating the dynamics of hypothetical dark matter particles on the not-so-userfriendly computers of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/aLlQxsGyhnw&quot; class=&quot;ld-embed-block&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite those advances, over the past half century, no one has ever directly detected a single particle of dark matter. Over and over again, dark matter has resisted being pinned down, like a fleeting shadow in the woods. Every time physicists have searched for dark matter particles with powerful and sensitive experiments in abandoned &lt;a href=&quot;https://sanfordlab.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://icecube.wisc.edu/about/overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, and whenever they’ve tried to produce them in particle accelerators, they’ve come back empty-handed. For a while, physicists hoped to find a theoretical type of matter called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), but searches for them have repeatedly turned up nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the WIMP candidacy all but dead, dark matter is apparently the most ubiquitous thing physicists have never found. And as long as it’s not found, it’s still possible that there is no dark matter at all. An alternative remains: instead of huge amounts of hidden matter, some mysterious aspect of gravity could be warping the cosmos instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that gravity behaves differently on large scales has been relegated to the fringe since Rubin’s and White’s heyday in the 1970s. But now it’s time to consider the possibility. Scientists and research teams should be encouraged to pursue alternatives to dark matter. Conferences and grant committees should allow physicists to hash out these theories and design new experiments. Regardless of who turns out to be right, such research on alternatives ultimately helps to crystallise the demarcation between what we don’t know and what we do. It will encourage challenging questions, spur reproducibility studies, poke holes in weak spots of the theories, and inspire new thinking about the way forward. And it will force us to decide what kinds of evidence we need to believe in something we cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;e have been here before. In the early 1980s, the Israeli physicist Mordehai ‘Moti’ Milgrom &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...270..365M/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; the increasingly popular dark matter narrative. While working at an institute south of Tel Aviv, he studied measurements by Rubin and others, and proposed that physicists hadn’t been missing matter; instead, they’d been wrongly assuming that they completely understood how gravity works. Since the outer stars and gas clouds orbit galaxies much faster than expected, it makes more sense to try to correct the standard view of gravity than to conjure an entirely new kind of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milgrom proposed that Isaac Newton’s second law of motion (describing how the gravitational force acting on an object varies with its acceleration and mass) changes ever so slightly, depending on the object’s acceleration. Planets such as Neptune or Uranus orbiting our sun, or stars orbiting close to the centre of our galaxy, don’t feel the difference. But far in the outlying areas of the Milky Way, stars would feel a smaller gravitational force than previously thought from the bulk of matter in the galaxy; adjusting Newton’s law could provide an explanation for the speeds Rubin measured, without needing to invoke dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing the paradigm of a dark-matter-less universe became Milgrom’s life project. At first, he worked mostly in isolation on his proto-theory, which he called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). ‘For more than a few years, I was the only one,’ he says. But slowly other scientists circled round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and a handful of others first focused on rotating galaxies, where MOND accurately describes what Rubin observed at least as well as dark matter theories do. Milgrom and colleagues then expanded the scope of their research, predicting a relationship between how fast the outside of a galaxy rotates and the galaxy’s total mass, minus any dark matter. The astronomers R Brent Tully and J Richard Fisher measured and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977A%26A....54..661T/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; just such a trend, which many dark matter models have struggled to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;When space-time gets curved in a particular way it creates the illusion of dark matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these successes, Milgrom’s modification of Newton’s second law remained just an approximation, causing his ideas to fall short of requirements for a full-fledged theory. That began to change when Milgrom’s colleague Jacob Bekenstein at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.70.083509&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; MOND to show it could be consistent with Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which predicts that gravity has the power to bend light rays, an idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/essays/einstein-v-newton-the-final-battle-during-a-total-eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; just over a century ago, during a solar eclipse in 1919, and today known as ‘gravitational lensing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble noticed that his colleagues had considered that close groups of gas clouds were actually far more distant galaxies. Building on Hubble’s discovery, other astronomers demonstrated the existence of larger cosmic structures now known as galaxy clusters, which have the power to act like powerful lenses, strongly bending light rays. Using formulas based on predictions by Einstein, it’s possible to infer the mass of a cosmic lens. Based on this mathematics, many physicists used gravitational lensing as an argument for the existence of dark matter. But Bekenstein showed that general relativity and MOND could also explain at least some lensing measurements that have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, these ideas were only partly formed. Indeed, Milgrom and Bekenstein still didn’t know what in physics could create a modified law of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOND lacked much of a foundation until a few years ago, when the Dutch physicist Erik Verlinde began developing a theory known as ‘emergent gravity’ to explain why gravity was altered. In Verlinde’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02269&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt;, gravity, including MOND, emerges as a kind of thermodynamic effect, related to increasing entropy or disorder. His ideas build on quantum physics as well, viewing space-time and the matter within it as originating from an interconnected array of quantum bits. When space-time gets curved, it produces gravity, and if it’s curved in a particular way, it creates the illusion of dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verlinde’s research is still waiting to be fleshed out. It’s still not clear, for instance, how modified or emergent gravity can make sense of the structure of the young Universe, discerned from relic radiation left behind from the Big Bang. Astrophysicists have used space telescopes to map out that radiation in incredible detail, but they haven’t yet found a way to make models without dark matter consistent with the measurements. ‘It’s not like this idea of emergent gravity can compete yet,’ Verlinde says, but in time it could become a real alternative to dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;ark matter theories make predictions too: if this form of matter exists, numerous subatomic dark matter particles should be frequently whizzing through our solar system, through the Earth, and even occasionally zipping through our bodies. But if huge amounts of dark matter indeed exist, enshrouding every galaxy in the Universe while being unseen and unfelt everywhere, then the elusive little particles typically won’t interact with normal matter in a way that anyone would notice. That makes actually detecting them a formidable task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While astrophysicists kept their eyes trained on the heavens, particle physicists sought to shed light on dark matter by creating plausible particles in their accelerators, like the powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. Intended to recreate such conditions as at the Big Bang, the LHC smashes particles together at great speeds so that, in bursts of energy, it produces new particles. Those particles pass through a series of detectors, which allow physicists to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the LHC and its predecessors, for example, at Fermilab west of Chicago, scientists managed to find all 17 particles predicted by the ‘standard model’ of particle physics, which includes all of the fundamental forces other than gravity. (They spotted the last standard particle, the Higgs boson, with the LHC in 2012.) Because of this string of successes, physicists were bullish about soon discovering dark matter particles as well, writes Dan Hooper, a Fermilab physicist, in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183565/at-the-edge-of-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;At the Edge of Time&lt;/em&gt; (2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in dark matter spawned a new generation of experiments, which Hooper and his colleagues hoped would finally pin down the mysterious particles. Scientists around the world built detectors deep beneath the Earth, often repurposing old mines, with the aim of finding dark matter particles while avoiding the cacophonous noise of cosmic rays and solar particles that would bombard any detector above ground. Dark matter particles could silently flit through a detector made of xenon or other materials and leave a sign of their passing in the form of heat, the researchers hypothesised. If the experiments fared as planned, scientists would finally spot dark matter particles and herald a new era of cosmology and particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;If dark matter particles exist, it will be extremely difficult to catch any glimpse of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the experiments haven’t turned up any positive signs, and researchers’ initial hopes have been dashed. In fact, experiments unable to find a hint of dark matter have ultimately shown evidence only of what dark matter is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. With each new experiment, the range of not-dark-matter has grown. Physicists have begun to understand that, if dark matter particles exist, it will be extremely difficult to catch any glimpse of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the situation looks bleak for WIMPs, which had been the most popular dark matter candidate. Researchers kept broadening their search, seeking ever-lower mass particles, and then even smaller particles, but continued to find nothing. A few teams continue the hunt for WIMPs with ever-more sensitive detectors, but in a few years they’ll reach the tiniest mass range, when any putative dark matter particle would interact with a detector similarly to how wispy neutrinos from the Sun do, effectively bringing the WIMP search to a screeching halt. ‘Then we will be done. You can see the end is in sight for the WIMPs. That may make people try to think of new things,’ says Peter Graham, a theoretical physicist at Stanford University in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the end is nigh for WIMPs, it’s certainly not the end of the story for dark matter searches, Graham argues. Scientists are already beginning to flock to other viable particles, especially axions. If they exist, axions would be billions of times less massive than WIMPs, and so they’d have to be incredibly abundant to add up to the expected mass of dark matter. Other, arguably more exotic candidates include so-called ‘sterile neutrinos’ and tiny primordial black holes, a version of MACHOs (for ‘massive compact halo objects’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few scientists, including Hooper, have even proposed hypothetical particles that experience hidden forces. These dark particles, if they exist, would annihilate and then decay into other particles that might somehow be coupled to known particles such as the Higgs boson. It’s plausible, but no one has made a clear detection of any of these hidden particles or forces yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As searches for dark particles falter, Milgrom has seen more physicists open to modified gravity in recent years. ‘People are not quite disillusioned, but there is a lot of disappointment with the fact that dark matter has not been detected,’ he said. ‘To me, that’s not the best reason to work on MOND, but I’m glad to see more interest.’ Whether this interest eventually translates into expanding research on modified gravity remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ld-dropcap&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;undreds if not thousands of astrophysicists, astronomers and particle physicists now study every aspect of dark matter and every imprint it might have on the cosmos, with state-of-the-art computers, telescopes and particle accelerators. Dark matter research has dwarfed modified gravity research for decades, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that dark matter is that much more convincing a theory. Instead, early on, some scientists thought it was a natural solution, others followed their view, and the scales tilted to their side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s seeming dominance of dark matter wasn’t inevitable. The processes through which scientists develop theories are heavily influenced by all sorts of historical and sociological factors, a point eloquently made by Andrew Pickering, emeritus philosopher of science at the University of Exeter and the author of &lt;em&gt;Constructing Quarks&lt;/em&gt; (1984), a 36-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo5951816.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that’s still relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to pay attention to who decides which phenomena to study, which research earns major government grants, which big experiments get funded, who gets speaking opportunities at scientific conferences, who is media savvy, who wins prominent fellowships and awards, and who gets promoted to high-profile faculty positions. Different choices sometimes can shape the future trajectory of science. And when choices by theorists and experimentalists coincide symbiotically, Pickering argues, it can be challenging for an upstart theory – such as modified gravity – to get a fair hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enterprise of science isn’t a particularly efficient or straightforward path toward ‘the truth’. Nevertheless, we need not despair, argues Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard University in Massachusetts and the author of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179001/why-trust-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why Trust Science?&lt;/em&gt; (2019). Though individual scientists are fallible and have their own values and goals and, occasionally, axes to grind, science as a collective affair goes on. Researchers might make missteps here and there, they might take a long time to rigorously vet some claims and establish others, and maybe a seemingly promising research programme reaches a dead end, but over time, scientists gradually build a consensus. It usually takes a while, but they eventually figure out which research paths should be left behind, and which ideas need to be studied further and refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dark matter versus modified gravity, this process hasn’t finished playing out. Dark matter is currently ascendant but the debate’s not over. The stakes are large, since the future of cosmology depends on the choices that astrophysicists make next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modified gravity scientists such as Milgrom and Verlinde face daunting challenges before having a real chance of developing their ideas into a valid alternative to dark matter. The biggest obstacle comes from the beginning of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1965ApJ...142..419P/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt; at first misinterpreted their radio telescope’s faint static as noise – perhaps due to pigeons roosting and leaving droppings on it. But the signal turned out to be real, and they confirmed their discovery of relic radio waves that date back to soon after the Big Bang. Then in the 1980s and ’90s, Soviet and NASA scientists used their own space telescopes, RELIKT-1 and COBE, to spot tiny wiggles in that radiation. John Mather and George Smoot, the physicists who led the COBE research, won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2006 for measuring those little radiation variations, which translate into early density differences that determined where the matter in the Universe collected and structures of galaxies formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;They predict far more dark matter clumps than suggested by the meagre number of satellite galaxies spotted so far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mather and Smoot’s successors have now measured the wiggles in relic radio radiation to exquisite precision, and any successful theory has to offer an explanation of them. Dark matter physicists have already shown that their theory could reproduce all of those wiggles quite well, but modified or emergent gravity has failed that critical test – so far. Bekenstein died in 2015, but his successors are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1320&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to make his modified gravity theory consistent with at least some of the measurements. That would be a big leap forward and a compelling one for skeptics of modified gravity, but it’s a major task that has yet to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the pieces of evidence, those wiggles are the strongest. Dark matter is clearly winning. It took decades of work by hundreds of dark matter scientists and huge investment in their research programmes to develop models that could explain all those measurements. Modified and emergent gravity, with lower levels of funding, remain far behind, but that doesn’t mean they should be abandoned. ‘My contention is that it’s very unlikely that emergent gravity is responsible for the phenomena we currently attribute to dark matter,’ Hooper says, ‘but it doesn’t mean that gravity isn’t emergent or that it’s not something worth exploring.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, dark matter researchers such as White and Hooper have their own problems to grapple with. Giant galaxies, including our own, typically have a handful of smaller galactic companions orbiting them like satellites. If dark matter physicists are right, each of those galaxies should be embedded within a huge clump of dark matter since dark matter particles and the galaxies’ stars should be drawn together by the same gravitational forces. But the latest computer simulations developed by White and his colleagues have some glaring differences with astronomers’ observations: they predict far more dark matter clumps than suggested by the meagre number of satellite galaxies spotted so far. Physicists tellingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9901240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; this the ‘missing satellites problem’, since reality doesn’t seem to match those theorists’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At much larger, cosmic scales, astrophysicists are also trying to explain a recent, puzzling discrepancy: that the Universe today seems to be expanding dramatically more rapidly than it did in its infancy. Physicists had expected the rate of expansion (called the Hubble constant) to be the same everywhere, but now they need to explain the disparity. With dark matter theorists unable to resolve the conundrum, Verlinde says perhaps emergent gravity will offer a path ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verlinde, Milgrom and their colleagues are still a small minority, but cosmology will benefit if their ranks grow. They’re already finding a few scientists in the dark matter community to be receptive to their ideas. At a recent conference he attended, Verlinde noticed a palpable shift in acceptance. ‘I felt like there was more communication and more willingness to discuss alternatives than years before,’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this theoretical work, physicists expect bigger, better telescopes and experiments to bear fruit, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, being built in the dry mountains of northern Chile. This year, scientists renamed it the Vera C Rubin Observatory, and it will have ‘first light’ next year. Inspired by Rubin’s work, researchers will peer wider and deeper into the heavens, mapping the light of billions of galaxies. If they keep an open mind, their studies could illuminate both dark matter and dark forces of gravity. Rubin’s namesake will continue provoking healthy debates about the vast hidden universe we yearn to further explore.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>24a2: An ultra-minimalist game engine</title>
<link>https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2/blob/master/website/static/img/banner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2/raw/master/website/static/img/banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24a2 is a simple game engine that lets you to build a game in a few hours. It has a very limited set of features which makes it easy to learn, and encourages you to solve problems creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24a2 games are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and are played in a web browser, so you can easily share what you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 24a2 games feature a 24 by 24 grid of dots. You can set the color of each dot, and read the color of each dot back. 24a2 can also run a function you define when an arrow key is pressed, or when a dot is clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about it! There are a few other features, which you can find out about in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://24a2.routley.io/tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://24a2.routley.io/reference/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using 24a2 means you don’t have to think about the visual style of your game, complicated physics or sound - you can just focus on actually building something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://24a2.routley.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website for more information, examples, and a tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Secretive – macOS native app to store SSH keys in the Secure Enclave</title>
<link>https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Secretive is an app for storing and managing SSH keys in the Secure Enclave. It is inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sekey/sekey&quot;&gt;sekey project&lt;/a&gt;, but rewritten in Swift with no external dependencies and with a handy native management app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/blob/master/.github/readme/app.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/raw/master/.github/readme/app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Secretive&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safer Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common setup for SSH keys is just keeping them on disk, guarded by proper permissions. This is fine in most cases, but it's not super hard for malicious users or malware to copy your private key. If you store your keys in the Secure Enclave, it's impossible to export them, by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Mac has a Secure Enclave, it also has support for strong access controls like Touch ID, or authentication with Apple Watch. You can configure your key so that they require Touch ID (or Watch) authentication before they're accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/blob/master/.github/readme/touchid.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/raw/master/.github/readme/touchid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Secretive authenticating with Touch ID&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretive also notifies you whenever your keys are acceessed, so you're never caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/blob/master/.github/readme/notification.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/raw/master/.github/readme/notification.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Secretive notifying the user&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support for Smart Cards Too!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Macs without Secure Enclaves, you can configure a Smart Card (such as a YubiKey) and use it for signing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the latest release over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/releases&quot;&gt;Releases Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive/blob/master/FAQ.md&quot;&gt;FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Auditable Build Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builds are produced by GitHub Actions with an auditable build and release generation process. Each build has a &quot;Document SHAs&quot; step, which will output SHA checksums for the build produced by the GitHub Action, so you can verify that the source code for a given build corresponds to any given release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Note Around Code Signing and Keychains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Secretive uses the Secure Enclave for key storage, it still relies on Keychain APIs to access them. Keychain restricts reads of keys to the app (and specifically, the bundle ID) that created them. If you build Secretive from source, make sure you are consistent in which bundle ID you use so that the Keychain is able to locate your keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backups and Transfers to New Machines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because secrets in the Secure Enclave are not exportable, they are not able to be backed up, and you will not be able to transfer them to a new machine. If you get a new Mac, just create a new set of secrets specific to that Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you discover any vulnerabilities in this project, please notify &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:max.goedjen@gmail.com&quot;&gt;max.goedjen@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; with the subject containing &quot;SECRETIVE SECURITY.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Xi-Editor Retrospective</title>
<link>https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A bit more than four years ago I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor&quot;&gt;xi-editor&lt;/a&gt; project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust as the implementation language for the core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A rope data structure for text storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully embracing async design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type&quot;&gt;CRDT&lt;/a&gt; as a mechanism for concurrent modification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599&quot;&gt;CRDT part of this retrospective&lt;/a&gt; already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher&quot;&gt;SpanWatcher&lt;/a&gt; interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883&quot;&gt;CRDT discussion&lt;/a&gt; previously linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lure-of-modular-software&quot;&gt;The lure of modular software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC&quot;&gt;DCE/RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture&quot;&gt;Corba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)&quot;&gt;Bonobo&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandstorm.io/&quot;&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module&quot;&gt;Fuchsia Modular&lt;/a&gt;. There are some partial successes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder&quot;&gt;Binder&lt;/a&gt; on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/&quot;&gt;OpenBinder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grpc.io/&quot;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)&quot;&gt;Blit&lt;/a&gt; and then, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS&quot;&gt;NeWS&lt;/a&gt; and X11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by &lt;a href=&quot;https://neovim.io/&quot;&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt;, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://msgpack.org/index.html&quot;&gt;MessagePack&lt;/a&gt;. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson&quot;&gt;simdjson&lt;/a&gt; is a good example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102&quot;&gt;JSON in Swift is shockingly slow&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139&quot;&gt;discussions on improving it&lt;/a&gt; but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, on the Rust side, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://serde.rs/&quot;&gt;serde&lt;/a&gt; is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde&quot;&gt;miniserde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde&quot;&gt;nanoserde&lt;/a&gt;, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rope&quot;&gt;The rope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent worst-case performance. Basically, there aren’t any cases where it performs &lt;em&gt;badly.&lt;/em&gt; And even the concern about excess copying because of its immutability might not be a real problem; Rust has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#method.make_mut&quot;&gt;copy-on-write mechanism&lt;/a&gt; where you can mutate in-place when there’s only one reference to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main argument against the rope is its complexity. I think this varies a lot by language; in C a gapped buffer might be preferable, but I think in Rust, a rope is the sweet spot. A large part of the reason is that in C, low level implementation details tend to leak through; you’ll often be dealing with a pointer to the buffer. For the common case of operations that don’t need to span the gap, you can hand out a pointer to a contiguous slice, and things just don’t get any simpler than that. Conversely, if any of the invariants of the rope are violated, the whole system will just fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust, though, things are different. Proper Rust style is for all access to the data structure to be mediated by a well-defined interface. Then the details about how that’s implemented are hidden from the user. A good way to think about this is that the implementation has complexity, but that complexity is &lt;em&gt;contained.&lt;/em&gt; It doesn’t leak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the rope in xi-editor meets that ideal. A lot of work went into getting it right, but now it works. Certain things, like navigating by line and counting UTF-16 code units, are easy and efficient. It’s built in layers, so could be used for other things including binary editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the rope is that it can readily and safely be shared across threads. Ironically we didn’t end up making much use of that in xi-editor, as it was more common to share across &lt;em&gt;processes,&lt;/em&gt; using sophisicated diff/delta and caching protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rope is a fairly niche data structure. You really only want it when you’re dealing with large sequences, and also doing a lot of small edits on them. Those conditions rarely arise outside text editors. But for people building text editing in Rust, I think xi-rope holds up well and is one of the valuable artifacts to come from the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15381886&quot;&gt;HN discussion of text editor data structures&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about the rope more, and can also point people to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html&quot;&gt;Rope science&lt;/a&gt; series for more color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;async-is-a-complexity-multiplier&quot;&gt;Async is a complexity multiplier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew going in that async was going to be a source of complexity. The hope is that we would be able to tackle the async stuff once, and that the complexity would be encapsulated, much as it was for the rope data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality was that adding async made everything more complicated, in some cases considerably so. A particularly difficult example was dealing with word wrap. In particular, when the width of the viewport is tied to the window, then live-resizing the window causes text to rewrap continuously. With the process split between front-end and core, and an async protocol between them, all kinds of interesting things can go wrong, including races between editing actions and word wrap updates. More fundamentally, it is difficult to avoid tearing-style artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One early relative success was implementing scrolling. The problem is that, as you scroll, the front-end needs to sometimes query the core to fetch visible text that’s outside its cache. We ended up building this, but it took months to get it right. By contrast, if we just had the text available as an in-process data structure for the UI to query, it would have been quite straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that async in interactive systems is more problematic than the tamer variety often seen in things like web servers. There, the semantics are generally the same as simple blocking threads, just with (hopefully) better performance. But in an interactive system, it’s generally possible to observe internal states. You have to display &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, even when not all subqueries have completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion, while the process split with plug-ins is supportable (similar to the Language Server protocol), I now firmly believe that the process separation between front-end and core was not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;syntax-highlighting&quot;&gt;Syntax highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the high point of the project was the successful implementation of syntax highlighting, based on Tristan Hume’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/trishume/syntect&quot;&gt;syntect&lt;/a&gt; library, which was motivated by xi. There’s a lot more to say about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, TextMate / Sublime style syntax highlighting is not really all that great. It is quite slow, largely because it grinds through a lot of regular expressions with captures, and it is also not very precise. On the plus side, there is a large and well-curated open source collection of syntax definitions, and it’s definitely “good enough” for most use. Indeed, code that fools these syntax definitions (such as two open braces on the same line) is a good anti-pattern to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising just how much slower regex-based highlighting is than fast parsers. The library that xi uses, syntect, is probably the fastest open source implementation in existence (the one in Sublime is faster but not open source). Even so, it is approximately 2500 times slower for parsing Markdown than &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark&quot;&gt;pulldown-cmark&lt;/a&gt;. And syntect doesn’t even parse setext-style lists correctly, because Sublime style syntax definitions have to work line-at-a-time, and the line of dashes following a heading isn’t available until the next line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These facts influenced the design of xi in two important ways. First, I took it as a technical challenge to provide a high-performance editing experience even on large files, overcoming the performance problems through async. Second, the limitations of the regex-based approach argued in favor of a modular plug-in architecture, so that as better highlighters were developed, they could be plugged in. I had some ambitions of creating a standard protocol that could be used by other editors, but this absolutely failed to materialize. For example, Atom instead developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2018-10-31-atoms-new-parsing-system/&quot;&gt;tree-sitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I dug in and did it. The resulting implementation is impressive in many ways. The syntax highlighter lives in a different process, with asynchronous updates so typing is never slowed down. It’s also incremental, so even if changes ripple through a large file, it updates what’s on the screen quickly. Some of the sophistication is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_11.html&quot;&gt;Rope science 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was considerable complexity in the implementation. Text was synchronized between the main xi-core process and the plug-in, but for large files, the latter stores only a fixed-size cache; the cache protocol ended up being quite sophisticated. Updates were processed through a form of Operational Transformation, so if a highlighting result raced a text edit, it would never color an incorrect region (this is still very much a problem for language server annotations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, syntax highlighting was something of a high point. The success suggested that a similar high-powered engineering approach could systematically work through the other problems. But this was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this work, I explored an alternative syntax highlighting engine based on parser combinators. If I had pursued that, the result would have been lightning fast, of comparable quality to the regex approach, and difficult to create syntax descriptions, as it involved a fair amount of manual factoring of parsing state. While the performance would have been nice to have, ultimately I don’t think there’s much niche for such a thing. If I were trying to create the best possible syntax highlighting experience today, I’d adapt Marijn Haverbeke’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/lezer.html&quot;&gt;Lezer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, syntax highlighting is a much easier problem than many of the others we faced, largely because the annotations are a history-free function of the document’s plain text. The problem of determining indentation may seem similar, but is dependent on history. And it basically doesn’t fit nicely in the CRDT model at all, as that requires the ability to resolve arbitrarily divergent edits between the different processes (imagine that one goes offline for a bit, types a bit, then the language server comes back online and applies indentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that our plug-in interface had become overly specialized to solve the problems of syntax highlighting, and did not well support the other things we wanted to do. I think those problems could have been solved, but only with significant difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-such-thing-as-native-gui&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as native GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, a major motivation for the front-end / core process split was to support development of GUI apps using a polyglot approach, as Rust wasn’t a suitable language for building GUI. The theory was that you’d build the GUI using whatever libraries and language that was most suitable for the platform, basically the platform’s native GUI, then interact with the Rust engine using interprocess communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument for this is probably macOS, which at the time had Cocoa as basically &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; blessed way to build GUI. Most other platforms have some patchwork of tools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/choose-your-platform&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; is particularly bad in this respect, as there’s old-school (GDI+ based) win32, WinForms, WPF, Xamarin, and most recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/&quot;&gt;WinUI&lt;/a&gt;, which nobody wants to use because it’s Windows 10 only. Since xi began, macOS is now catching up in the number of official frameworks, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/&quot;&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; and SwiftUI added to the roster. Outside the realm of official Apple projects, lots of stuff is shipping in Electron these days, and there are other choices including Qt, Flutter, Sciter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-raph-levien&quot;&gt;performance work&lt;/a&gt; on xi, I found to my great disappointment that performance of these so-called “native” UI toolkits was often pretty poor, even for what you’d think of as the relatively simple task of displaying a screenful of text. A large part of the problem is that these toolkits were generally made at a time when software rendering was a reasonable approach to getting pixels on screen. These days, I consider GPU acceleration to be essentially required for good GUI performance. There’s a whole other blog post in the queue about how some toolkits try to work around these performance limitations by leveraging the compositor more, but that has its own set of drawbacks, often including somewhat ridiculous RAM usage for all the intermediate textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented an OpenGL-based text renderer for xi-mac, and did similar explorations on Windows, but this approach gives up a lot of the benefits of using the native features (as a consequence, emoji didn’t render correctly). Basically, I discovered that there is a pretty big opportunity to build UI that doesn’t suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most interesting exploration was on Windows, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-win&quot;&gt;xi-win&lt;/a&gt; project. Originally I was expecting to build the front-end in C# using one of the more mainstream stacks, but I also wanted to explore the possibility of using lower-level platform capabilities and programming the UI in Rust. Early indications were positive, and this project gradually morphed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/druid&quot;&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, a native Rust GUI toolkit which I consider very promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had said that I would be building a GUI toolkit from scratch as part of this work when I set out, people would have rightly ridiculed the scope as far too ambitious. But that is how things are turning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fuchsia&quot;&gt;Fuchsia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the history of the project is its home in Fuchsia for a couple years. I was fortunate that the team was willing to invest in the xi vision, including funding Colin’s work and letting me host Tristan to build multi-device collaborative editing as an intern project. In many ways the goals and visions aligned, and the demo of that was impressive. Ultimately, though, Fuchsia was not at the time (and still isn’t) ready to support the kind of experience that xi was shooting for. Part of the motivation was also to develop a better IME protocol, and that made some progress (continued by Robert Lord, and you can read about some of what we discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://lord.io/blog/2019/text-editing-hates-you-too/&quot;&gt;Text Editing Hates You Too&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sad this didn’t work out better, but such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-low-point&quot;&gt;A low point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My emotional tone over the length of the project went up and down, with the initial enthusiasm, stretches of slow going, a renewed excitement over getting the syntax highlighting done, and some other low points. One of those was learning about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom-archive/xray&quot;&gt;xray&lt;/a&gt; project. I probably shouldn’t have taken this personally, as it is &lt;em&gt;very common&lt;/em&gt; in open source for people to spin up new projects for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that it’s fun to do things yourself, and often you learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, xray was a bit of a wake-up call for me. It was evidence that the vision I had set out for xi was not quite compelling enough that people would want to join forces. Obviously, the design of xray had a huge amount of overlap with xi (including the choice of Rust and decision to use a CRDT), but there were other significant differences, particularly the choice to use Web technology for the UI so it would be cross-platform (the fragmented state of xi front-ends, especially the lack of a viable Windows port, was definitely a problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m putting this here because often, how you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; about a project is just as important, even more so, than technical aspects. I now try to listen more deeply to those emotional signals, especially valid criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the goal of the project was to develop a good open-source community. We did pretty well, but looking back, there are some things we could have done better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the friction was simply the architectural burden described above. But in general I think the main thing we could have done better is giving contributors more &lt;em&gt;agency.&lt;/em&gt; If you have an idea for a feature or other improvement, you should be able to come to the project and do it. The main role of the maintainers should be to help you do that. In xi, far too often things were blocking on some major architectural re-work (we have to redo the plug-in API before you can implement that feature). One of the big risks in a modular architecture is that it is often expedient to implement things in one module when to do things “right” might require it in a different place, or, even worse, require changes in inter-module interfaces. We had these decisions a lot, and often as maintainers we were in a gate-keeping role. One of the worst examples of this was vi keybindings, for which there was a great deal of community interest, and even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Peltoche/vixi&quot;&gt;project done off to the side&lt;/a&gt; to try to achieve it, but never merged into the main project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think monolithic architectures, perhaps ironically, are &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for community. Everybody takes some responsibility for the quality of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 we hosted three Google Summer of Code Students: Anna Scholtz, Dzũng Lê, and Pranjal Paliwal. This worked out well, and I think GSoC is a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate for almost the entire time to have Colin Rofls taking on most of the front-line community interaction. To the extent that xi has been a good community, much of the credit is due him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we have done very right is setting up a Zulip instance. It’s open to all with a Github account, but we have had virtually no difficulty with moderation issues. We try to maintain positive interactions around all things, and lead by example. This continues as we pivot to other things, and may be one of the more valuable spin-offs of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The xi-editor project had very ambitious goals, and bet on a number of speculative research subprojects. Some of those paid off, others didn’t. One thing I would do differently is more clearly identify which parts are research and which parts are reasonably straightforward implementations of known patterns. I try to do that more explicitly today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent the project was optimized for learning rather than shipping, and through that lens it has been pretty successful. I now know a lot more than I did about building editor-like GUI applications in Rust, and am now applying that to making the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/druid&quot;&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; toolkit and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linebender/runebender&quot;&gt;Runebender&lt;/a&gt; font editor. Perhaps more important, because these projects are more ambitious than one person could really take on, the community started around xi-editor is evolving into one that can sustain GUI in Rust. I’m excited to see what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>xi-editor retrospective</og:title>
<og:description>A bit more than four years ago I started the xi-editor project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community). The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”: Rust as the implementation language for the core. A rope data structure for text storage. A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process. Fully embracing async design. CRDT as a mechanism for concurrent modification. I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I also believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary. I’ve written the CRDT part of this retrospective already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good discussion on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design. Origins The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor). The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the SpanWatcher interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse. The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking. These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs. To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework. That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)? When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the CRDT discussion previously linked. The lure of modular software There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include DCE/RPC, Corba, Bonobo, and more recently things like Sandstorm and Fuchsia Modular. There are some partial successes, including Binder on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about OpenBinder). When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, gRPC was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of Blit and then, of course, NeWS and X11. I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions. Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as primarily being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed. For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc. One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by Neovim, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes. One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing. Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources. JSON The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons. The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language. Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as MessagePack. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (simdjson is a good example). Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, JSON in Swift is shockingly slow. There are discussions on improving it but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation. Second, on the Rust side, while serde is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including miniserde and nanoserde, but serde is still by far the most mainstream. I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet. The rope There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice. Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time. My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent worst-case performance. Basically, there aren’t any cases where it performs badly. And even the concern about excess copying because of its immutability might not be a real problem; Rust has a copy-on-write mechanism where you can mutate in-place when there’s only one reference to the data. The main argument against the rope is its complexity. I think this varies a lot by language; in C a gapped buffer might be preferable, but I think in Rust, a rope is the sweet spot. A large part of the reason is that in C, low level implementation details tend to leak through; you’ll often be dealing with a pointer to the buffer. For the common case of operations that don’t need to span the gap, you can hand out a pointer to a contiguous slice, and things just don’t get any simpler than that. Conversely, if any of the invariants of the rope are violated, the whole system will just fall apart. In Rust, though, things are different. Proper Rust style is for all access to the data structure to be mediated by a well-defined interface. Then the details about how that’s implemented are hidden from the user. A good way to think about this is that the implementation has complexity, but that complexity is contained. It doesn’t leak out. I think the rope in xi-editor meets that ideal. A lot of work went into getting it right, but now it works. Certain things, like navigating by line and counting UTF-16 code units, are easy and efficient. It’s built in layers, so could be used for other things including binary editing. One of the best things about the rope is that it can readily and safely be shared across threads. Ironically we didn’t end up making much use of that in xi-editor, as it was more common to share across processes, using sophisicated diff/delta and caching protocols. A rope is a fairly niche data structure. You really only want it when you’re dealing with large sequences, and also doing a lot of small edits on them. Those conditions rarely arise outside text editors. But for people building text editing in Rust, I think xi-rope holds up well and is one of the valuable artifacts to come from the project. There’s a good HN discussion of text editor data structures where I talk about the rope more, and can also point people to the Rope science series for more color. Async is a complexity multiplier We knew going in that async was going to be a source of complexity. The hope is that we would be able to tackle the async stuff once, and that the complexity would be encapsulated, much as it was for the rope data structure. The reality was that adding async made everything more complicated, in some cases considerably so. A particularly difficult example was dealing with word wrap. In particular, when the width of the viewport is tied to the window, then live-resizing the window causes text to rewrap continuously. With the process split between front-end and core, and an async protocol between them, all kinds of interesting things can go wrong, including races between editing actions and word wrap updates. More fundamentally, it is difficult to avoid tearing-style artifacts. One early relative success was implementing scrolling. The problem is that, as you scroll, the front-end needs to sometimes query the core to fetch visible text that’s outside its cache. We ended up building this, but it took months to get it right. By contrast, if we just had the text available as an in-process data structure for the UI to query, it would have been quite straightforward. I should note that async in interactive systems is more problematic than the tamer variety often seen in things like web servers. There, the semantics are generally the same as simple blocking threads, just with (hopefully) better performance. But in an interactive system, it’s generally possible to observe internal states. You have to display something, even when not all subqueries have completed. As a conclusion, while the process split with plug-ins is supportable (similar to the Language Server protocol), I now firmly believe that the process separation between front-end and core was not a good idea. Syntax highlighting Probably the high point of the project was the successful implementation of syntax highlighting, based on Tristan Hume’s syntect library, which was motivated by xi. There’s a lot more to say about this. First, TextMate / Sublime style syntax highlighting is not really all that great. It is quite slow, largely because it grinds through a lot of regular expressions with captures, and it is also not very precise. On the plus side, there is a large and well-curated open source collection of syntax definitions, and it’s definitely “good enough” for most use. Indeed, code that fools these syntax definitions (such as two open braces on the same line) is a good anti-pattern to avoid. It may be surprising just how much slower regex-based highlighting is than fast parsers. The library that xi uses, syntect, is probably the fastest open source implementation in existence (the one in Sublime is faster but not open source). Even so, it is approximately 2500 times slower for parsing Markdown than pulldown-cmark. And syntect doesn’t even parse setext-style lists correctly, because Sublime style syntax definitions have to work line-at-a-time, and the line of dashes following a heading isn’t available until the next line. These facts influenced the design of xi in two important ways. First, I took it as a technical challenge to provide a high-performance editing experience even on large files, overcoming the performance problems through async. Second, the limitations of the regex-based approach argued in favor of a modular plug-in architecture, so that as better highlighters were developed, they could be plugged in. I had some ambitions of creating a standard protocol that could be used by other editors, but this absolutely failed to materialize. For example, Atom instead developed tree-sitter. In any case, I dug in and did it. The resulting implementation is impressive in many ways. The syntax highlighter lives in a different process, with asynchronous updates so typing is never slowed down. It’s also incremental, so even if changes ripple through a large file, it updates what’s on the screen quickly. Some of the sophistication is described in Rope science 11. There was considerable complexity in the implementation. Text was synchronized between the main xi-core process and the plug-in, but for large files, the latter stores only a fixed-size cache; the cache protocol ended up being quite sophisticated. Updates were processed through a form of Operational Transformation, so if a highlighting result raced a text edit, it would never color an incorrect region (this is still very much a problem for language server annotations). As I said, syntax highlighting was something of a high point. The success suggested that a similar high-powered engineering approach could systematically work through the other problems. But this was not to be. As part of this work, I explored an alternative syntax highlighting engine based on parser combinators. If I had pursued that, the result would have been lightning fast, of comparable quality to the regex approach, and difficult to create syntax descriptions, as it involved a fair amount of manual factoring of parsing state. While the performance would have been nice to have, ultimately I don’t think there’s much niche for such a thing. If I were trying to create the best possible syntax highlighting experience today, I’d adapt Marijn Haverbeke’s Lezer. To a large extent, syntax highlighting is a much easier problem than many of the others we faced, largely because the annotations are a history-free function of the document’s plain text. The problem of determining indentation may seem similar, but is dependent on history. And it basically doesn’t fit nicely in the CRDT model at all, as that requires the ability to resolve arbitrarily divergent edits between the different processes (imagine that one goes offline for a bit, types a bit, then the language server comes back online and applies indentation). Another problem is that our plug-in interface had become overly specialized to solve the problems of syntax highlighting, and did not well support the other things we wanted to do. I think those problems could have been solved, but only with significant difficulty. There is no such thing as native GUI As mentioned above, a major motivation for the front-end / core process split was to support development of GUI apps using a polyglot approach, as Rust wasn’t a suitable language for building GUI. The theory was that you’d build the GUI using whatever libraries and language that was most suitable for the platform, basically the platform’s native GUI, then interact with the Rust engine using interprocess communication. The strongest argument for this is probably macOS, which at the time had Cocoa as basically the blessed way to build GUI. Most other platforms have some patchwork of tools. Windows is particularly bad in this respect, as there’s old-school (GDI+ based) win32, WinForms, WPF, Xamarin, and most recently WinUI, which nobody wants to use because it’s Windows 10 only. Since xi began, macOS is now catching up in the number of official frameworks, with Catalyst and SwiftUI added to the roster. Outside the realm of official Apple projects, lots of stuff is shipping in Electron these days, and there are other choices including Qt, Flutter, Sciter, etc. When doing some performance work on xi, I found to my great disappointment that performance of these so-called “native” UI toolkits was often pretty poor, even for what you’d think of as the relatively simple task of displaying a screenful of text. A large part of the problem is that these toolkits were generally made at a time when software rendering was a reasonable approach to getting pixels on screen. These days, I consider GPU acceleration to be essentially required for good GUI performance. There’s a whole other blog post in the queue about how some toolkits try to work around these performance limitations by leveraging the compositor more, but that has its own set of drawbacks, often including somewhat ridiculous RAM usage for all the intermediate textures. I implemented an OpenGL-based text renderer for xi-mac, and did similar explorations on Windows, but this approach gives up a lot of the benefits of using the native features (as a consequence, emoji didn’t render correctly). Basically, I discovered that there is a pretty big opportunity to build UI that doesn’t suck. Perhaps the most interesting exploration was on Windows, the xi-win project. Originally I was expecting to build the front-end in C# using one of the more mainstream stacks, but I also wanted to explore the possibility of using lower-level platform capabilities and programming the UI in Rust. Early indications were positive, and this project gradually morphed into Druid, a native Rust GUI toolkit which I consider very promising. If I had said that I would be building a GUI toolkit from scratch as part of this work when I set out, people would have rightly ridiculed the scope as far too ambitious. But that is how things are turning out. Fuchsia An important part of the history of the project is its home in Fuchsia for a couple years. I was fortunate that the team was willing to invest in the xi vision, including funding Colin’s work and letting me host Tristan to build multi-device collaborative editing as an intern project. In many ways the goals and visions aligned, and the demo of that was impressive. Ultimately, though, Fuchsia was not at the time (and still isn’t) ready to support the kind of experience that xi was shooting for. Part of the motivation was also to develop a better IME protocol, and that made some progress (continued by Robert Lord, and you can read about some of what we discovered in Text Editing Hates You Too). It’s sad this didn’t work out better, but such is life. A low point My emotional tone over the length of the project went up and down, with the initial enthusiasm, stretches of slow going, a renewed excitement over getting the syntax highlighting done, and some other low points. One of those was learning about the xray project. I probably shouldn’t have taken this personally, as it is very common in open source for people to spin up new projects for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that it’s fun to do things yourself, and often you learn a lot. Even so, xray was a bit of a wake-up call for me. It was evidence that the vision I had set out for xi was not quite compelling enough that people would want to join forces. Obviously, the design of xray had a huge amount of overlap with xi (including the choice of Rust and decision to use a CRDT), but there were other significant differences, particularly the choice to use Web technology for the UI so it would be cross-platform (the fragmented state of xi front-ends, especially the lack of a viable Windows port, was definitely a problem). I’m putting this here because often, how you feel about a project is just as important, even more so, than technical aspects. I now try to listen more deeply to those emotional signals, especially valid criticisms. Community Part of the goal of the project was to develop a good open-source community. We did pretty well, but looking back, there are some things we could have done better. A lot of the friction was simply the architectural burden described above. But in general I think the main thing we could have done better is giving contributors more agency. If you have an idea for a feature or other improvement, you should be able to come to the project and do it. The main role of the maintainers should be to help you do that. In xi, far too often things were blocking on some major architectural re-work (we have to redo the plug-in API before you can implement that feature). One of the big risks in a modular architecture is that it is often expedient to implement things in one module when to do things “right” might require it in a different place, or, even worse, require changes in inter-module interfaces. We had these decisions a lot, and often as maintainers we were in a gate-keeping role. One of the worst examples of this was vi keybindings, for which there was a great deal of community interest, and even a project done off to the side to try to achieve it, but never merged into the main project. So I think monolithic architectures, perhaps ironically, are better for community. Everybody takes some responsibility for the quality of the whole. In 2017 we hosted three Google Summer of Code Students: Anna Scholtz, Dzũng Lê, and Pranjal Paliwal. This worked out well, and I think GSoC is a great resource. I have been fortunate for almost the entire time to have Colin Rofls taking on most of the front-line community interaction. To the extent that xi has been a good community, much of the credit is due him. One of the things we have done very right is setting up a Zulip instance. It’s open to all with a Github account, but we have had virtually no difficulty with moderation issues. We try to maintain positive interactions around all things, and lead by example. This continues as we pivot to other things, and may be one of the more valuable spin-offs of the project. Conclusion The xi-editor project had very ambitious goals, and bet on a number of speculative research subprojects. Some of those paid off, others didn’t. One thing I would do differently is more clearly identify which parts are research and which parts are reasonably straightforward implementations of known patterns. I try to do that more explicitly today. To a large extent the project was optimized for learning rather than shipping, and through that lens it has been pretty successful. I now know a lot more than I did about building editor-like GUI applications in Rust, and am now applying that to making the Druid toolkit and the Runebender font editor. Perhaps more important, because these projects are more ambitious than one person could really take on, the community started around xi-editor is evolving into one that can sustain GUI in Rust. I’m excited to see what we can do. Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust.</og:description>
