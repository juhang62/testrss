<title>Hackers went undetected in Citrix’s internal network for six months</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Hackers gained access to technology giant Citrix’s networks six months before they were discovered, the company has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5983600-Citrix-letter-to-California-attorney-general.html&quot;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to California’s attorney general, the virtualization and security software maker said the hackers had “intermittent access” to its internal network from October 13, 2018 until March 8, 2019, two days after the FBI alerted the company to the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix said the hackers “removed files from our systems, which may have included files containing information about our current and former employees and, in limited cases, information about beneficiaries and/or dependents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the company said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/03/08/citrix-investigating-unauthorized-access-to-internal-network/&quot;&gt;hackers stole business documents&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s saying the stolen information may have included names, Social Security numbers and financial information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/04/04/citrix-provides-update-on-unauthorized-internal-network-access/&quot;&gt;in a later update&lt;/a&gt; on April 4 that the attack was likely a result of password spraying, which attackers use to breach accounts by brute-forcing from a list of commonly used passwords that aren’t protected with two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Citrix how many staff were sent data-breach notification letters, but a spokesperson did not immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under California law, the authorities must be informed of a breach if more than 500 state residents are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Common Blood Test Can Cost $11 or Almost $1k</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/upshot/health-care-huge-price-discrepancies.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/upshot/health-care-huge-price-discrepancies.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s one of the most common tests in medicine, and it is performed millions of times a year around the country. Should a metabolic blood panel test cost $11 or $952?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Both of these are real, negotiated prices, paid by health insurance companies to laboratories in Jackson, Miss., and  El Paso in 2016. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/blog/entry/hmi-2019-service-prices&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New data&lt;/a&gt;, analyzing the health insurance claims of 34 million Americans covered by large commercial insurance companies, shows that enormous swings in price for identical services are common in health care. In just one market — Tampa, Fla. — the most expensive blood test costs 40 times as much as the least expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you’re a patient seeking a metabolic blood panel, good luck finding out what it will cost. Although hospitals are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/hospital-prices-online.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;now required to publish&lt;/a&gt; a list of the prices they would like patients to pay for their services, the amounts that medical providers actually agree to accept from insurance companies tend to remain closely held secrets. Some insurance companies provide consumers with tools to help steer them away from the $450 test, but in many cases you won’t know the price your insurance company agreed to until you get the bill. If you have an insurance deductible, a $400 — or even a $200 — bill for a blood test can be an unpleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Outside of health care, a swing of prices as huge as the one for blood tests in Tampa is unheard-of. Recent studies of the retail prices of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/THE-MORPHOLOGY-OF-PRICE-DISPERSION-Kaplan/fe959cc8917c4843ef926a5c1fd5e480317a588e&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ketchup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/mic.20170130&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drywall&lt;/a&gt;, for example, showed much less variation. A bottle of Heinz ketchup in the most expensive store in a given market could cost six times as much as it would in the least expensive store. But most bottles of ketchup tended to cost around the same. And, in every case, you would know the price of your ketchup before buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s shocking,” said Amanda Starc, an associate professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern, who has studied the issue. “The variation in prices in health care is much greater than we see in other industries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In some cities, the blood test prices look more like the prices for consumer goods. Most tests in Baltimore cost around $30. Most in Portland, Ore., cost around $20. But if you live in Miami or Los Angeles, the price becomes much harder to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hospitals and insurers negotiate over prices in private, and they don’t want competitors to know about the deals they’ve been able to cut. The data in this article comes from the Health Care Cost Institute, which pools bills from three large insurance companies. (Even the institute can’t say which insurers and providers are attached to the different prices, and it has eliminated certain markets with less competition where it might be easy to guess.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Trump administration may eliminate this secrecy, making numbers like the ones in these charts more common and easier to find.  As The Wall Street Journal has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-weighs-publicizing-hospital-rates-negotiated-with-insurers-11551990505&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, the administration has asked for comments on a proposal to require doctors and hospitals to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/trump-health-care-rates.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;publish negotiated prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/blog/entry/hmi-2019-service-prices&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/blog/entry/hmi-2019-service-prices&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he institute examined&lt;/a&gt; several common procedures and observed two kinds of pricing differences. Prices vary considerably between markets. And, in many metro areas, they range widely between one health care provider and another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Because these are prices paid by insurance companies, many experts say the differences between markets matter more, because they affect insurance premiums that all those with insurance in that area pay, even if they don’t get a blood test or an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/15/upshot/the-best-places-for-better-cheaper-health-care-arent-what-experts-thought.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt;. On average, a cesarean section birth in the Bay Area costs more than three times as much as one near Louisville, Ky., according to the institute’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The average hotel room in the San Francisco area last year cost only around double the average hotel room in Louisville, according to STR, which tracks the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The swing within markets increasingly matters for patients, too, as the share of employer plans with sizable deductibles &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/business/health-insurance-analysis-kaiser.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;keeps rising&lt;/a&gt;. That means that choosing a provider where your insurance company has failed to strike a good deal could mean significant out-of-pocket costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In some cases, prices may be higher because the quality of services or the cost of doing business in a given market is higher. More influential is market power, either that of insurers or hospitals, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sherry Glied, a health economist who is the dean of the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, said a bigger factor is probably how many patients your insurer sends to a given hospital. Popular places are likely to offer better prices, because the insurance company negotiates a bulk discount. The most expensive providers tend to be the ones where the insurance company has little negotiating leverage — and where the service is so rarely used it doesn’t mind the higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“One person buys one hamburger, and another buys 1,000,” she said. “And it completely makes sense that the guy who buys 1,000 hamburgers gets a better price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That sort of market power can work in the opposite direction, too. In markets where there is a dominant hospital chain, or a powerful hospital that many patients insist on using, insurers tend to face high prices, with less leverage to bargain the hospitals down. Martin Gaynor, a professor of health economics at Carnegie Mellon University, was a co-author of a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/1/51/5090426?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; showing that in markets where fewer hospitals competed for patients, the hospitals tended to be paid more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Some of these really simple diagnostic tests — what the heck?” Mr. Gaynor said. “It does mean, in a sense, the market is broken in terms of problems with market power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The prices that hospitals and doctors charge to patients who are not in their insurance networks also range widely, and are typically (though not always) higher than the prices that insurers pay. The Obama administration began publishing these list prices for some of the most common medical services on a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government website&lt;/a&gt;. The Trump administration recently began requiring hospitals to also publish a comprehensive list of prices on their own sites, though the data &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/hospital-prices-online.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;can be challenging&lt;/a&gt; to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For years, Jeanne Pinder, who runs the consumer-oriented website &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://clearhealthcosts.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clear Health Costs&lt;/a&gt;, has been collecting the cash prices for medical procedures around the country. She said the only health care services with predictable pricing were the cash-only treatments that insurance doesn’t cover, like Lasik eye surgery, Botox and tooth whitening. “When you get into M.R.I.s, ultrasounds and blood tests, they are crazy,” she said. “The secrecy in pricing all over this marketplace encourages this behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;css-11q3cgf e1mu4ftr0&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1psfkbx etfikam0&quot;&gt;The data from the Health Care Cost Institute shows real, negotiated prices for services in metropolitan areas among patients with private employer insurance through Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare. The prices range from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile, but eliminate the lowest and highest prices from the range. For outpatient services, the price is the cost for a single C.P.T. code. For inpatient services, the number represents all payments from an admission associated with the relevant D.R.G. code, so some of the variation reflects differences in care as well as price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://80000hours.org/2019/04/career-advice-i-wish-id-been-given-when-i-was-young/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/490858-636888518662482884-16x9-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-44591&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/490858-636888518662482884-16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/490858-636888518662482884-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/490858-636888518662482884-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A reader who prefers to remain anonymous — but whose career we think did a lot of good — passed us this list of advice which they were grateful to have received, or wish they’d been given when they were younger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We thought it was very interesting, including where it doesn’t line up exactly with our usual views, and so are publishing it here with their permission. The advice is targeted towards people sympathetic to the principles of effective altruism, especially those with an interest in public policy careers, but we think much of it is more broadly useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t focus too much on long-term plans.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on interesting projects and you’ll build a resumé that stands out — take on multiple part-time consultancies and volunteer projects in parallel to quickly build it out. Back in my 30s, most of the things on my resumé were projects that involved 10% of my time each, and about half of them didn’t pay me any money. Those projects sounded fancy and helped me to get good full-time jobs later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find good thinkers and cold-call the ones you most admire.&lt;/strong&gt; Many years ago I was lucky that people like Peter Singer, Peter Unger, John Broome, and Derek Parfit were kind enough to respond to my letters. (Any readers who are famous should take the time to respond to strangers’ emails.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was similarly lucky that some of the policy professionals whose work I was most impressed with replied to me when I wrote out of the blue to say that I wanted to work for them. If you have contacts in their networks who can vouch for you, that also helps. (&lt;em&gt;Editor: See &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/community/&quot;&gt;our article&lt;/a&gt; on the importance of meeting people.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few cases it really helped that I didn’t need to get paid, since lack of funding is a common reason for an employer to say no. So, if you’re in a position to do so, try to save money from paid projects and spend it on unpaid projects that are intrinsically valuable or that look good on your resumé. Unfortunately, this advice is much easier to follow for people who come from a privileged financial background and don’t have a lot of financial responsibilities (e.g. to family or dependents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdsource your career decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve done this for most of the last few decades, polling people I trust, and the advice seems generally good in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a pleasant person.&lt;/strong&gt; People want colleagues who seem pleasant and happy and good humoured. Washington DC especially operates more on social capital than on merit, and brilliant jerks typically don’t do as well in government as they do in industry or academia. In the rationality community I know there’s a lot of emphasis on providing direct critical feedback, but if you’re planning to get things done in the policy world, practice being nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assign a high value to productivity over your whole lifespan.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt habits associated with good long-term mental and physical health, including long-term relationships, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. (&lt;em&gt;Editor: See &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/&quot;&gt;our compilation&lt;/a&gt; of evidence-backed health and self-improvement advice.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t over-optimise things that aren’t your top priority.&lt;/strong&gt; I try to avoid the time and anxiety associated with over-optimising. For most decisions I just use satisficing heuristics — is this action sufficient to meet a project’s primary goal? Unless it’s a highly consequential and irreversible decision, I don’t spend much time thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read a lot, and read things that people around you aren’t reading.&lt;/strong&gt; Set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/alerts&quot;&gt;Google Alerts&lt;/a&gt; for obscure topics that you think are important and aren’t likely to be covered by blogs. I have about 200 Google Alerts and most of them are weird enough that I get maybe one alert per month, but they’re often really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid stuff that could cause irreversible reputational harm, or slow down a security clearance.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid committing crimes, avoid drugs, and avoid saying stuff online that you could regret later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect seriously on what problem to prioritise solving.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about global health and animal welfare but, despite my best efforts, I haven’t been able to avoid the conclusion that we should &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/articles/extinction-risk/&quot;&gt;focus on reducing existential risks&lt;/a&gt;. Among those risks, I’m a little worried about the effective altruism community piling into &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/&quot;&gt;work on artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to an excessive degree. We certainly need more people working on AI, but I hope some are planning to help prevent &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/we-are-not-worried-enough-about-the-next-pandemic/&quot;&gt;biological accidents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/&quot;&gt;nuclear war&lt;/a&gt;, and cyber attacks that damage critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to solve problems that aren’t popular.&lt;/strong&gt; Popularity of a problem is evidence that it is hard to solve, competition is high, and your individual contribution is likely to be small. In contrast, neglected problems often have low-hanging solutions that no one has bothered to look for, there’s less competition to break into roles that have influence, and your individual contribution may be uniquely large. This is essentially the standard market advice to buy low and sell high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Editor: See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/&quot;&gt;problem selection framework&lt;/a&gt; which has ‘neglectedness’ as a criterion, or our article on why the world’s most pressing problems &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/&quot;&gt;aren’t the ones that first come to mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more history.&lt;/strong&gt; I still read a lot about technology, but at the margin I probably get more value from reading histories of institutional disasters and near-disasters, and the biographies of people who helped avoid some of those disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid spending time to earn or save money.&lt;/strong&gt; I now see time as my most valuable resource, and I’m willing to spend money to save time. I pay for ridesharing so that I can work during transit, I frequently buy meals so that I can save time spent cooking, I pay higher rent to have a shorter commute, and I don’t spend time searching for bargains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years I spent a lot of time finding creative ways to reduce my living expenses in order to be able to donate more. In hindsight, if I had assigned a value of just $20 an hour to my time, most of those efforts at cost-reduction weren’t actually cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m also pretty sceptical of &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/#approach-1-earning-to-give&quot;&gt;‘earning-to-give’&lt;/a&gt; careers.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s because it’s very unlikely that you can earn more money than you would have been able to direct in a funding organisation — there’s a lot more competition to become a billionaire than there is to become a leader or grantmaker at a foundation or important government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find easy ways you can come across better.&lt;/strong&gt; Many years ago a friend suggested that for people trying to have a big impact, there might be no more cost-effective self-improvement investment than enrolling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toastmasters_International&quot;&gt;Toastmasters&lt;/a&gt; and buying a gym membership. If I were more rational I’d take this advice, and in general the effective altruism community might invest too little in superficial improvements, such as appearance and charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the biographies of people whose job you’d like to have, and figure out how they got there.&lt;/strong&gt; You can potentially try to reverse engineer their career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some jobs in government may be easier to get than you imagine.&lt;/strong&gt; I think that’s because they’re typically not as financially rewarding as corporate jobs with comparable hours. Rather than consider a life in government, I suggest trying a 3 to 5 year stint, and see what you’re able to contribute. (&lt;em&gt;Editor: See &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-kalil-government-careers/&quot;&gt;a recent podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; with a great deal of concrete advice on how to do exactly this.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think there might be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/&quot;&gt;over-emphasis&lt;/a&gt; on ‘personal fit’ in effective altruism.&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t loved my jobs, and if important jobs were more pleasant, there would probably be more people doing them, and more of our problems would be solved. I’ve settled for tolerable jobs that seem important. I’ve had a lot of satisfaction from working at my jobs but they have been hard, some days were really rough, and it was a weekly toss-up on whether I had ‘personal fit.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Golden: Mapping human knowledge</title>
<link>https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After building and selling Heyzap back in 2016 I had free reign to dig into the question of “what should I really be working on?” and how to create something that would have a lasting impact on society. In part of this journey I’ve had the privilege to invest in over 150 startups from my Winter 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/wiki/Y_Combinator&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt; class to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/y-combinator-w19-companies/&quot;&gt;most recent batch&lt;/a&gt;. While researching areas of interest, I often wondered why we have such a lack of organization of human knowledge. This gap is especially apparent for emerging technologies, new startups and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--1-.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden’s mission is to collect, organize and express 10+ billion topics in an accessible way, presented in neutrally-written and comprehensive topic pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help achieve this mission we raised a $5 million seed round from &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz_(a16z)&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Gigafund&quot;&gt;Gigafund&lt;/a&gt; (Luke and Steve), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Founders_Fund&quot;&gt;Founders Fund&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cyan_Banister&quot;&gt;Cyan Banister&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SV_Angel&quot;&gt;SV Angel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Liquid_2_Ventures&quot;&gt;Liquid 2 Ventures&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Joe_Montana&quot;&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3038448/dropboxs-first-employee-if-your-network-isnt-diverse-in-and-of-itself-then&quot;&gt;Aston Motes&lt;/a&gt; (1st employee at &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;), Christina Brodbeck (1st designer of Youtube), Lee Linden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Immad_Akhund&quot;&gt;Immad Akhund&lt;/a&gt; (my cofounder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Heyzap&quot;&gt;Heyzap&lt;/a&gt;, now CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Mercury&quot;&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;), Josh Buckley, Howie Liu (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Airtable&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;), James Smith (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Bugsnag&quot;&gt;Bugsnag&lt;/a&gt;), James Tamplin (Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Firebase&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;), Jack Smith, Mike Einziger of Incubus, Sumon Sadhu, Paul McKellar (Square founding team), Trip Adler (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Scribd&quot;&gt;Scribd&lt;/a&gt;) and many other great angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-leading-edges-of-knowledge-from-the-quark-to-the-jaguar&quot;&gt;Mapping leading edges of knowledge — from the quark to the jaguar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An abundance of knowledge is available to us via the Internet, but navigating the cacophony of formats, designs, sources and standards is challenging. Google, Wikipedia, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Quora, StackExchange, Github, etc are our go-to places for seeking information. However, the knowledge reference products in the market today fall short of mapping, in a highly organized way, everything we collectively know as a human society and what exists on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific examples of topics that have been hard to find canonical information on include: &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cluster%3A_Blockchain_%26_cryptocurrency#Blockchain-Theory-and-Fundamentals_Consensus&quot;&gt;Consensus mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, new legal instruments like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SAFT_(Simple_Agreement_for_Future_Tokens)&quot;&gt;Simple Agreement for Future Tokens&lt;/a&gt;, new fund constructions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cryptocurrency_hedge_fund&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency hedge funds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Arrington_XRP_Capital&quot;&gt;Arrington XRP Capital&lt;/a&gt;; companies/projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Benchling&quot;&gt;Benchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/HelloSign&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/CryptoKitties&quot;&gt;CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.co/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks&quot;&gt;Ginkgo Bioworks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Momentus_Space&quot;&gt;Momentus Space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)&quot;&gt;Brave web browser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Google_AutoML&quot;&gt;Google AutoML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Algorand&quot;&gt;Algorand&lt;/a&gt;; academic areas e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Quantum_Artificial_Life&quot;&gt;Quantum Artificial Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Lenia&quot;&gt;Lenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/CRISPR-Cas13&quot;&gt;CRISPR/Cas13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution_(PACE)&quot;&gt;phage-assisted continuous evolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Constructor_theory&quot;&gt;constructor theory&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a small sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible and necessary to map everything that exists systematically and pull together academic papers, documentaries, videos, podcasts, further reading, guides and meta-data that surrounds these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notability-validation-and-the-knowledge-age&quot;&gt;Notability, validation and the Knowledge Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of Wikipedia and use it multiple times per day. I believe it is one of the most important things that humans have ever built. However, as we speak, pages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SV_Angel&quot;&gt;SV Angel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Benchling&quot;&gt;Benchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Lisk&quot;&gt;Lisk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Urbit&quot;&gt;Urbit&lt;/a&gt; and many others are and have been deleted from Wikipedia because they don't reach the notability standard of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Product_Hunt&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; was recently up for deletion but somehow survived the cull. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/HelloSign&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, a few weeks before Dropbox acquired it for $230 million was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/HelloSign&quot;&gt;removed from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/BuildZoom&quot;&gt;BuildZoom&lt;/a&gt; was removed 5 times from Wikipedia and now doesn't exist there. It doesn't just apply to company pages though. Actual technologies, projects, products, theoretical electrical components and academic ideas are missing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrary threshold of what is notable and what is not doesn't cut it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRGTsHhR10w&quot;&gt;Knowledge Age&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics&quot;&gt;5.8 million English language articles in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and Google had &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html&quot;&gt;1 billion objects (200x Wikipedia's size) in its Knowledge Graph&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in 2015. We estimate internally that there are 1000x the entities to cover than what Wikipedia has today. It’s an exciting challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in an age of extreme niches, an age when validation and completeness is more important than notability. Our encyclopedia on Golden doesn't have limited shelf space — we eventually want to map everything that exists. Special relativity was not notable to the general public the moment Einstein released his seminal paper, but certainly was later on — could this have been the kind of topic to be removed from the world's canon if it was discovered today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notability restrictions of our current encyclopedias limit the availability of knowledge around fascinating and useful niche topics. For this reason, we are taking a knowledge maximalist perspective. Let’s unleash hidden knowledge, using existence as a framework for whether a topic gets covered and supplement what Wikipedia has built over the last 18 years. Like a Mandelbrot set or squiggles from Fermat, the richness is in the edges and the margins and the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have a great opportunity to use new technologies to solve the problems: &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/suggestions&quot;&gt;human in the loop AI systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models&quot;&gt;fully automatic and unsupervised language writing systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate&quot;&gt;WYSIWYG editors&lt;/a&gt;, React, cheap cloud storage/processing, auto &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Grammarly&quot;&gt;spelling/grammar checking&lt;/a&gt;, graph databases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikitribune.com/project/real-names-policy-a-note-from-jimmy-wales/&quot;&gt;real identity&lt;/a&gt; and collaboration models like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Git&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; pave the way to build a new system for compiling and serving the knowledge. With that context in mind, we want to introduce you to Golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;encouraging-deep-extensive-knowledge&quot;&gt;Encouraging deep, extensive knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden has been designed from the start to encourage a deep, extensive view on knowledge. If an extremely niche topic is valuable to just a handful of people and positively contributes to society, it will have a home on Golden. Some initial areas of our focus will include core topics on science, technology, and business, but also on the leading edges of research and investigation in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-modern-editor&quot;&gt;A modern editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to a knowledge base shouldn’t require technical expertise or esoteric formatting knowledge. We’ve created a WYSIWYG editor to lower the barrier to entry and encourage more people to participate globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built speedy citation tools into Golden and intend to create more affordances around claim validation. You can simply highlight any claim and add a citation that is evidence to support that claim. All of these citations can then be easily viewed and examined by anyone viewing the article on Golden. We have gone a little step further by allowing ‘high resolution’ citations i.e. being able to highlight the specific part of the claim you want to back up. Over time, we want to have tighter bindings between claims and evidence in order to improve claim verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Magic-Citations.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Magic-Citations&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you identify a problem with a particular claim or how an article is written, Golden users can “Create an issue” to call attention to the issue. If there are multiple issues on a given article, each can be dealt with and resolved separately in its own discussion thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-ui-and-ai-to-save-human-time-and-get-better-results&quot;&gt;Using UI and AI to save human time and get better results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the thesis from day 1, we have aimed to remove all the repetitive work, bring leverage to editing, and add a little fun to the process. For example, we have built a system called “AI suggestions” which produces modular snippets of machine-learning outputs, suggested improvements that can be made to the content with simple “yes”, “no”, or “skip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/AI-Suggestions.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;AI-Suggestions&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be adding a crosslink to another topic page, or adding a link to an academic paper we have found around a topic. It could also be the detection and creation of an entirely new topic because it popped up inside multiple new academic papers and news publications, or it could be the addition of a detected thumbnail for the topic. Internally, we have many types of these and will release more to the general users as they become more robust. We’ve found that it’s fun to make atomic edits on mobile or on the move in a more casual way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-58-39.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-58-39&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have many more suggestion types coming out soon in order to increase the leverage of human help when putting the Golden knowledge base together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-56-00.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-56-00&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also built AI tools into the topic page editing experience. Simply click on the magic wand to enter AI-assisted mode. The AI assistant will use URLs to extract relevant information to add to the topic page. This particular feature is still early in its development but clearly shows how we want to empower human editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/screencast-2019-04-23-14-13-52.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;screencast-2019-04-23-14-13-52&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tables in Golden also take advantage of our AI extraction tools. When you paste a URL into one of our “magic cells” (i.e., a cell marked with the wand icon) in Golden, our tool will auto-extract key information from that URL, such as the title and authors of an article, abstracts, and more. This saves a lot of time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also considered what makes a rich schema around a topic in terms of the metadata that surrounds it. For example, every article has a timeline to show how that entity has evolved over time. You can post a URL into our timeline AI tool, quickly get a headline and summary about the events discussed in that link, and then modify the language to make it more neutral, canonical and encyclopedic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Timeline-Detection-AI.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Timeline-Detection-AI&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Golden AI bot is constantly working to connect knowledge across Golden and find resources that are relevant to each entity page by crawling the web. We have an extensive roadmap in this department and if you are interested in working on this problem at Golden please &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/about/careers&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;transparency-and-openness&quot;&gt;Transparency and openness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong need for this platform to be open so we are embracing Creative Commons 4.0 for the text on topic pages and are cognisant of current standards of openness. Public topic pages will be free to access and the text available on CC BY-SA 4.0. If you have any feedback on this, please get in touch with us. We also have full activity logs of changes to pages that aim to bring more &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/wiki/Geltor/activity&quot;&gt;transparency to edits&lt;/a&gt; and make it easier for our team and you to fact check, monitor, and improve edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden topic pages are completely free and open to the public. People will be able to view, edit, or create entities on Golden forever. However, our vast knowledge base and query capability means we can also provide a number of tools and services that particularly benefit &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/enterprise&quot;&gt;companies and organizations&lt;/a&gt;. The features below are designed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/pricing&quot;&gt;paid&lt;/a&gt; users. We believe there is a good incentive alignment to have correct information on Golden that can also serve commercial-grade research requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advanced-query-tool&quot;&gt;Advanced query tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of building the Golden knowledge base includes identifying and developing a wide range of structured and unstructured data. Paid users can use the Golden Query Tool to search across Golden’s knowledge base to find specific information in more corporate-focused queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/enterprise-query.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;enterprise-query&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do, from time to time, open up queries to the public that we think are useful for everyone, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/y-combinator-w19-companies&quot;&gt;Y Combinator Batch W19&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-therapeutics-companies&quot;&gt;a list of therapeutics companies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-venture-capital-firms/&quot;&gt;all the VC firms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/cryptocurrency-whitepapers&quot;&gt;all crypto currency projects we could find whitepapers for&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-regenerative-medicine-companies/&quot;&gt;regenerative medicine companies&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this advanced query tool is extremely useful for investment funds, large consultancies and large companies, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/about/contact-us&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you want to experience one of the best query tools out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fine-grained-alerts&quot;&gt;Fine-grained alerts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve saved a particular search query that you want to monitor, you can set up alerts to be notified if any new results match your query. Users can also set alerts on particular attributes they’re monitoring on their queries or lists. For example, you can be alerted if a company has a spinout, changes CEO, enters a new market, releases a new technology, and many other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-requests-and-subsidizing-public-knowledge&quot;&gt;Research requests and subsidizing public knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden aims to have complete knowledge across a wide swath of companies, people, products, technologies and beyond. If you're looking for knowledge that's not in Golden today, please contact us! We have high-quality researchers available to build out knowledge in areas you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built this into our paid plans too. Paid users who come across topic pages that don’t have as much desired information can simply click the “Request info” button. This kicks off a process with our research team and AI bots to quickly build better and more content. If users don’t get the results they expect in the Golden Query Tool, a similar button exists to start the same process to find topics that fulfill the query.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.K. Police Have a Message for Crime Victims: Hand over Your Private Data</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/world/europe/rape-victim-data-privacy-uk.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/world/europe/rape-victim-data-privacy-uk.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;LONDON — The British police delivered a striking warning to crime victims on Monday: If you want the case to be pursued, be prepared to turn over personal data from your mobile phone, laptop, tablet or smart watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Police have a duty to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry,” Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for criminal justice, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/progress-update-in-meeting-the-disclosure-challenge&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Those now frequently extend into the devices of victims and witnesses as well as suspects — particularly in cases where suspects and victims know each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the new policy raised concerns about potential invasions of privacy and the risk of discouraging people from reporting crimes, particularly offenses like sexual assault that are already underreported because victims fear being treated like the guilty ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In many cases, the police already search digital trails, which can produce evidence that either backs up an accusation or casts doubt on it. Privacy advocates say that police departments often improperly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/Digital%20Stop%20and%20Search%20Report.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download cellphone data&lt;/a&gt; from people they detain, without their knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under the new approach, victims and witnesses will routinely be asked to sign a form saying that they consent to the police extracting data from their electronic devices, which can mean text messages, emails, contacts, social media records, internet browsing history and more. Otherwise, the case might not proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;How much data the police extract will vary from one investigation to another, and the police say they will focus on collecting information that may be relevant to the case at hand. But, they warned, if investigators stumble across something incriminating — even if it is irrelevant to the original case — the accuser can become the accused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If information is identified from your device that suggests the commission of a separate criminal offense, other than the offense(s) under investigation, the relevant data may be retained and investigated by the police,” according to written statement to victims and witnesses that will accompany the consent form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Anything the police find, it says, will be handed over to prosecutors. And in some cases, devices might not be given back to their owners for weeks or even months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These excessive digital trawls set an alarming precedent for the criminal justice system,” Griff Ferris, a legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, a nonprofit civil liberties group, said in an email on Monday. “Treating rape victims like suspects in this way delays investigations and trials, prolongs distress for both victims and suspects, deters victims from reporting and obstructs justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most sexual assaults are committed by people who are known to the victims, and there might be electronic proof of friendly communications between them. As a result, according to Victim Support, a nonprofit group in England and Wales, the new policy could discourage victims from reporting, fearing that they will not be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ephgrave, the assistant commissioner, acknowledged such concerns in his statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We understand that how personal data is used can be a source of anxiety,” he said. “We would never want victims to feel that they can’t report crimes because of ‘intrusion’ in their data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“That’s why a new national form has been introduced,” replacing policies that varied from place to place, “to help police seek informed consent proportionately and consistently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the form was criticized because of the possible repercussions for victims who refuse to lay bare their digital lives: The police and prosecutors might drop their cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Victim Support argued that the policy could leave victims feeling coerced into agreeing to the electronic searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Katie Russell, the national spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, an umbrella organization for rape crisis centers, said it was a misnomer to refer to the forms for victims and witnesses as “consent forms,” because “complainants don’t have a full and free choice as to whether to agree to the scrutiny and storage of their personal data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Who decides what is relevant, and by what standards, will not be clear to people reading the forms, she said, and the policy could result in victims being subjected to greater scrutiny than suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Survivors of sexual assault often decide not to go to the police because of “fear of the criminal justice system and of being made to feel ‘like the one under investigation/on trial,’ ” Ms. Russell wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“In some cases, suspects’ phones aren’t even requested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Now dev – Serverless on localhost</title>
<link>https://zeit.co/blog/now-dev</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://zeit.co/blog/now-dev</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;6.3566176470588&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;7.8235294117647&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/now&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; was born out of the idea that deploying a website could be much simpler. You only have to run a single command: &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; – that is all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.3846153846154&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;10.153846153846&quot;&gt;With our &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/gitlab&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; integrations, we enabled deploying on every &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;, and teams to manage staging and production by simply merging pull requests.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.4734299516908&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;10.550724637681&quot;&gt;Not only did &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/blog/now-2&quot;&gt;Now 2.0&lt;/a&gt; make deployments effortless, it made them scalable and global by default. Thanks to monorepo support, you could develop static websites and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;serverless lambdas&lt;/a&gt; within the same repository.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-3894149877&quot;&gt;Today, we are excited to announce one command to run it all on localhost: &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, developing a website or application involves a series of steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;jsx-2774342158&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-1755564361&quot;&gt;Cloning repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-1755564361&quot;&gt;Fetching packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-1755564361&quot;&gt;Synchronizing and matching ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-1755564361&quot;&gt;Downloading the right runtime for each programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-1755564361&quot;&gt;And so on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for modern projects, we often need to look up the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file for instructions about installing dependencies, and then tell a package manager to run developer scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-3894149877&quot;&gt;Now gives you a different contract. It is always &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work with servers, the developer workflow is quite tedious. You have to run a process, find the port, then make your changes, then kill the process (usually with Control+C)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work with &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-3894149877&quot;&gt;modern frontend frameworks&lt;/span&gt; (like Next.js or Gatsby) your HTML, CSS and client-side JavaScript, &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-3894149877&quot;&gt;hot-reloading&lt;/span&gt; is expected instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you introduce API endpoints written as serverless functions, we now also have the advantage of bringing live reloading to your backend. &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt; ensures that every single request builds and runs the latest version of your code (yes, like &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;.php&lt;/code&gt; for every language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.75625&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;10.95&quot;&gt;Every piece of technology, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/now-cli&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/now-builders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;Builders&lt;/a&gt; that compile your code into static files and lambda functions, is fully open-source and MIT licensed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;6.3388429752066&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;7.801652892562&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/now&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; ensures that you write code with the same open and standard APIs of your programming language or framework of choice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is Next.js pages, Node.js HTTP request handlers or Express.js endpoints – we ensure that your code remains agnostic and portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;next dev&lt;/code&gt; command (the old way of developing Next.js apps), &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt; allows you to run your entire suite of web apps and APIs all at once, with just a single command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;5.4634146341463&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;6.3739837398374&quot;&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;nextjs-news&lt;/a&gt; uses both a Next.js application and a Node.js API – both running at the same time using &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-730510203&quot;&gt;No matter how many builds, `now dev` will boot them all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.2169811320755&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;9.622641509434&quot;&gt;If you are building a static site using a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, all you need to do is add the command you would normally use to a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now-dev&lt;/code&gt; script in &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;now-dev&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;gatsby develop -p $PORT&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that is completed, the tool (in this case &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt;) is invoked automatically, along with all other Builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;4.8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;5.6&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/gatsbygram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;Gatsbygram&lt;/a&gt; example showcases this really well:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-730510203&quot;&gt;@now/static-build is the only Builder that requires adjustment to work with `now dev`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8.875&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;12.819444444444&quot;&gt;If you chose to write a backend in &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;, there are no changes to be made in order for your project to work with &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt;, you just run the command:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-730510203&quot;&gt;In this example, both `@now/static` and `@now/go` are run in parallel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7.6748466257669&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;11.085889570552&quot;&gt;Even if your application is spawning a instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;Headless Chrome&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;), local development will be very smooth, as &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt; emulates production closely:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-730510203&quot;&gt;As you can see, both `now dev` and `puppeteer` will boot up in no time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8.7457627118644&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;12.632768361582&quot;&gt;As a bonus, you will be glad to know that &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt; also acts as a substitute for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/serve&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-2993520687&quot;&gt;serve&lt;/a&gt; out of the box. Any time you want to serve a directory quickly, you know what to reach for:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-730510203&quot;&gt;Even though there is no `now.json` file, serving the directory just works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;5.048275862069&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3929410651&quot; readability=&quot;5.8896551724138&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now dev&lt;/code&gt; is available in beta as part of the latest version of &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/download&quot;&gt;Now CLI&lt;/a&gt;. To get it, run &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;npm install -g now&lt;/code&gt; or check out our other &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/download&quot;&gt;download options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a quick project to test it with, try &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-515620400&quot;&gt;now init&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;now init nextjs
cd nextjs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3587049505&quot;&gt;now dev
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-831800268&quot; readability=&quot;5.9111111111111&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;jsx-831800268&quot;&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-831800268&quot;&gt;This feature release is limited to &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-2062641765 in-warning&quot; href=&quot;https://zeit.co/upgrade&quot;&gt;Now 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jsx-3751313775 wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8.8690036900369&quot;&gt;

<title>Facebook is redesigning its core app</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523265/facebook-events-groups-redesign-news-feed-features-f8-2019</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523265/facebook-events-groups-redesign-news-feed-features-f8-2019</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;XKQydA&quot;&gt;Facebook announced an overhaul of its main mobile app today that puts more emphasis on two of its most critical features: events and groups. The company says it’s placing groups front and center as a cornerstone of how it wants users to think of the main Facebook app, while events is getting a fresh coat of paint as one of the most-used parts of the app that keeps users coming back day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KyOjSw&quot;&gt;“There are tens of millions of active groups on Facebook. When people find the right one, it often becomes the most meaningful part of how they use Facebook. And today, more than 400 million people on Facebook belong to a group that they find meaningful,” the company said in a blog post. “With this in mind, we’re rolling out a fresh new design for Facebook that’s simpler and puts your communities at the center. We’re also introducing new tools that will help make it easier for you to discover and engage with groups of people who share your interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AiG03A&quot;&gt;Facebook says the mobile redesign will start rolling out immediately on iOS and Android around the world. It’s also working on a desktop redesign that will arrive in the coming months. The biggest change to note is the new groups tab that’s now placed in the middle row of the redesigned menu bar. When tapping in, users will now get a personalized feed of updates from their various groups as well as recommendations to join new groups based on their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;KNtMET&quot;&gt;There’s also a new feature, called Meet New Friends, that Facebook is seeding throughout the entire app to help people connect with strangers that have shared interests or real-world connections, like working for the same employer or attending the same school. Facebook says it is integrating Meet New Friends into its new groups design to help people meet who may have a shared online interest and a real-world connection that means they can connect in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OTqeIa&quot;&gt;Facebook is making a concerted effort to ensure groups are visible in every part of the app, so it’ll start promoting groups in areas like Marketplace and Watch. It’s also building specific tools tailored to group types, like a new listing format for groups focused on finding new jobs or buying buttons built into live broadcasts for groups that focus on selling used products. With the new design, the company says you’ll also be able to post to any group you’re a part of from the News Feed as if you were posting to your own profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;pixvJ4&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;YI3fYL&quot;&gt;As for events, Facebook is putting a big emphasis on helping you find stuff to do in your neighborhood. The new events tab, which now sits next to the groups tab in the new menu bar layout, has a richer map view for seeing where the events you’re interested in are in proximity to one another. There’s also a much more intuitive look and feel to the design that makes it easy to find new events, organize your calendar, and quickly sift through events your friends are hosting and public ones, like concerts, that you may be interested in checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;kIC0ZN&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;c-image-gallery&quot; data-cid=&quot;apps/image_gallery-1556720290_4989_82560&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;anthem_component_id&amp;quot;:1093579,&amp;quot;entry_id&amp;quot;:18287306,&amp;quot;routing&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;keyboard&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;two_col&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;display_headline&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;expandable&amp;quot;:false}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__body&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__viewer&quot; data-ui=&quot;viewer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__image&quot; data-ui=&quot;next-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523265/facebook-events-groups-redesign-news-feed-features-f8-2019&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PA11OC&quot;&gt;Facebook is in the earliest stages of completely redefining the type of company it wants to be and the products it wants to offer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253458/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy-encrypted-messaging-whatsapp-messenger-instagram&quot;&gt;following CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s pledge last month&lt;/a&gt; to transition the social network into a “privacy-focused communications platform.” Part of that process involves knitting together its three massive messaging and photo-sharing apps into one unified service, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254715/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messaging-plan-single-encrypted-ephemeral-news-feed&quot;&gt;despite the obvious complications there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ae8LWi&quot;&gt;The other part of that process will involve establishing why people will want to use the main Facebook app in the future, and how the company can better serve those people as it transitions away from the News Feed. The public feed, which encouraged sharing and tried to incentivize people to connect and engage with as many people as possible, became a core pillar of Facebook that has defined its last decade of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OAomWJ&quot;&gt;Yet the News Feed — and its primary utility as a data-harvesting tool to help Facebook serve ads targeted toward your online behavior — also remains the biggest source of the company’s ongoing problems around data privacy, security, moderation, and platform misuse. The News Feed treated every user as a publisher on the world’s biggest media platform, but Facebook largely ignored or tried to absolve itself of responsibility for the effects that would have on society when it grew to include one-third of the Earth’s population. In the process, Facebook became a tool for violence and authoritarianism in developing countries, an anchor that’s helped tank the news industry, and a megaphone for extremists who are looking to broadcast and amplify acts of terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Sq98Qm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The News Feed era is over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wjbAJO&quot;&gt;One of the primary architects of the News Feed, Chris Cox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266141/facebook-whatsapp-head-chief-product-officer-chris-cox-daniels&quot;&gt;left the company last month&lt;/a&gt; after Zuckerberg announced his new philosophy and planned direction for the company, helping signal that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266488/chris-cox-quits-facebook-news-feed-privacy-pivot&quot;&gt;News Feed era is officially over&lt;/a&gt;. The News Feed is far from going away, and Facebook has a lot of work to do to remedy its toxic effects on online discourse, election integrity, and misinformation and fake news. But Zuckerberg has made clear — as did the exodus of users that flocked to Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch, and other social platforms — that the News Feed is an antiquated way of thinking about and trying to foster online communication and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qJmixE&quot;&gt;With these changes to events and groups, Facebook is staking out a new vision of its core app that’s less dictated by the algorithmic whims of the News Feed and the company’s prior growth-at-all-costs philosophy. (Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514805/facebook-q1-2019-earnings-ftc-record-fine-privacy-violations-3-billion&quot;&gt;continues to grow nonetheless&lt;/a&gt;: it hit close to 2.4 billion monthly active users as of last week.) The main utility people get from Facebook these days is in connecting with communities both large and small that are largely away from the public eye and centered on a shared interest. Facebook is also great at just being an address book, an events calendar, and — for at least a subset of aging social media users — a way to reconnect with old high school and college friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kw58v6&quot;&gt;For that to work, the company is taking its cues from sites it once considered threats, like Reddit and other community-based social networks, before it grew big enough to eclipse the most populous countries on Earth. As a result, it appears Zuckerberg sees less of a reason to invest in the old, outdated vision of a global town square that treats connection and the power to broadcast to the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17178086/facebook-growth-memo-leak-boz-andrew-bosworth&quot;&gt;as a de facto benefit for humanity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
