<title>Why SQLite succeeded as a database (2016)</title>
<link>https://changelog.com/podcast/201</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://changelog.com/podcast/201</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So the customer… They were using Informix for the database engine. The problem that I was working on, it was a really interesting problem. We had to solve an NP-complete problem, which of course we couldn’t solve, but we could do really good approximations and that’s what it was about. It was a really, really cool product and I was a contractor, but I was sort of leading the design. Anyway, we put this thing out in the field for testing, and it was in an industrial site, and the people were operating the equipment. They would sometimes power cycle the machine that it was running on, and when it would come back up, Informix database sometimes would not come up, and this was a configuration problem, that’s all it was. There was nothing wrong with Informix. They just hadn’t installed it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in the database it didn’t come up, the users would double click on my application. I would try and connect to the database and wouldn’t be able to, and I would pop up a dialog box that says, “I’m sorry, I can’t connect to the database.” And course, it wasn’t my problem, but my application painted the dialogue box, so I got the support call. And I thought “This is not a good thing. I’m not in the database business.” Being a database guy is never part of my career goal, and so what can I do about this? And I thought, “Well look, the way we’re using this database - it’s read-only, at least us, and it’s very, very slowly changing otherwise. If the computer is healthy enough to bring up my application, why can’t I read the data directly off of disk? Why do I have to go through a server to get to my data?” There was a funding interruption, I had couple months off and I thought, “Hey, I’m just gonna go and cobble together a really quick and simple database engine that just does a few very simple SQL commands, insert the lead, update and select.” No joints, wasn’t trying to be efficient… All I needed to do was pull stuff off of a disk in that memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I put it out there and… I’ve been doing open source for years before this, putting things on my website, and people would find my thing – or well, you know, I’d put things on my website and it’d get like five downloads per year, or something like that. I’d figured this would be just another one of those things, but for whatever reason it really resonated with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing on Net News, somebody had this really exciting post on Net News about, “Wow! I have an SQL database engine running on my palm pilot. This is no joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, whenever people get excited about your software, an ego boost kicks in any you’re like, “I’m gonna work on this and make it a little bit better.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hackers Were Inside Citrix for Five Months</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/hackers-were-inside-citrix-for-five-months/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/hackers-were-inside-citrix-for-five-months/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Networking software giant &lt;strong&gt;Citrix Systems&lt;/strong&gt; says malicious hackers were inside its networks for five months between 2018 and 2019, making off with personal and financial data on company employees, contractors, interns, job candidates and their dependents. The disclosure comes almost a year after Citrix acknowledged that digital intruders had broken in by probing its employee accounts for weak passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/citrix-notice.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-50561&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/citrix-notice.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix provides software used by hundreds of thousands of clients worldwide, including most of the Fortune 100 companies. It is perhaps best known for selling virtual private networking (VPN) software that lets users remotely access networks and computers over an encrypted connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, the &lt;strong&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/strong&gt; (FBI) alerted Citrix they had reason to believe cybercriminals had gained access to the company’s internal network. The FBI told Citrix the hackers likely got in using a technique called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/password-spraying/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;password spraying&lt;/a&gt;,” a relatively crude but remarkably effective attack that attempts to access a large number of employee accounts (usernames/email addresses) using just a handful of common passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/03/08/citrix-investigating-unauthorized-access-to-internal-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; released at the time, Citrix said it appeared hackers “may have accessed and downloaded business documents,” and that it was still working to identify what precisely was accessed or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a letter sent to affected individuals dated Feb. 10, 2020, Citrix disclosed additional details about the incident. According to the letter, the attackers “had intermittent access” to Citrix’s internal network between Oct. 13, 2018 and Mar. 8, 2019, and that there was no evidence that the cybercrooks still remain in the company’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix said the information taken by the intruders may have included Social Security Numbers or other tax identification numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, payment card numbers, and/or limited health claims information, such as health insurance participant identification number and/or claims information relating to date of service and provider name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many people received this letter, but the communication suggests Citrix is contacting a broad range of individuals who work or worked for the company at some point, as well as those who applied for jobs or internships there and people who may have received health or other benefits from the company by virtue of having a family member employed by the company.&lt;span id=&quot;more-50556&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrix’s letter was prompted by laws in virtually all U.S. states that require companies to notify affected consumers of any incident that jeopardizes their personal and financial data. While the notification does not specify whether the attackers stole proprietary data about the company’s software and internal operations, the intruders certainly had ample opportunity to access at least some of that information as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Citrix initially disclosed the intrusion in March 2019, a little-known security company &lt;strong&gt;Resecurity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190313082751/https://resecurity.com/blog/supply-chain-the-major-target-of-cyberespionage-groups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; it had evidence Iranian hackers were responsible, had been in Citrix’s network for years, and had offloaded terabytes of data. Resecurity also presented evidence that it notified Citrix of the breach as early as Dec. 28, 2018, a claim Citrix initially denied but later acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian hackers recently have been blamed for hacking VPN servers around the world in a bid to plant backdoors in large corporate networks. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ClearSky-Fox-Kitten-Campaign.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;report released this week&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) by security firm &lt;strong&gt;ClearSky&lt;/strong&gt; details how Iran’s government-backed hacking units have been busy exploiting security holes in popular VPN products from Citrix and a number of other software firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClearSky says the attackers have focused on attacking VPN tools because they provide a long-lasting foothold at the targeted organizations, and frequently open the door to breaching additional companies through supply-chain attacks. The company says such tactics have allowed the Iranian hackers to gain persistent access to the networks of companies across a broad range of sectors, including IT, security, telecommunications, oil and gas, aviation, and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the VPN flaws available to attackers is a recently-patched vulnerability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-19781&lt;/a&gt;) in Citrix VPN servers dubbed “Shitrix” by some in the security community. The derisive nickname may have been chosen because while Citrix &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;initially warned customers about the vulnerability in mid-December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it didn’t start releasing patches to plug the holes until late January 2020 — roughly two weeks after attackers started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/proof-of-concept-code-published-for-citrix-bug-as-attacks-intensify/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;publicly released exploit code&lt;/a&gt; to break into vulnerable organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would your organization hold up to a password spraying attack? As the Citrix hack shows, if you don’t know you should probably check, and then act on the results accordingly. It’s a fair bet the bad guys are going to find out even if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt has turned on stricter validation requirements</title>
<link>https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v1-v2-validating-challenges-from-multiple-network-vantage-points/112253</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v1-v2-validating-challenges-from-multiple-network-vantage-points/112253</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday February 19th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; we’ll turn on &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/validating-challenges-from-multiple-network-vantage-points/40955&quot;&gt;stricter validation requirements&lt;/a&gt; in production. We’ll make multiple validation requests from different network perspectives. Most issuance should continue as normal; we believe that a small number of domain names may need fixing. The most common issue will be hosts that use extremely strict firewall rules to allow validation from only specified IP addresses (a practice we &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#what-ip-addresses-does-let-s-encrypt-use-to-validate-my-web-server&quot;&gt;do not recommend&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously only one validation request from one of our primary datacentres was required. After Feb 19th we will make four total validation requests (1 from a primary datacentre, and 3 from remote datacentres). The primary request and at least 2 of the 3 remote requests must receive the correct challenge response value for the domain to be considered authorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future we will continue to evaluate adding more network perspectives and may change the number and required threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the production deployment of the change &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/validating-challenges-from-multiple-network-vantage-points/40955&quot;&gt;we previously announced&lt;/a&gt; for our staging environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing that domain validation succeeds in the staging environment is the best way to determine if your ACME integration will be affected by this change. If you are currently successfully performing issuance in the staging environment there is no need for action on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note this change affects both the ACME V2 API, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/end-of-life-plan-for-acmev1/88430&quot;&gt;deprecated ACME v1 API.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exception List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that some ACME client deployments have problems satisfying multiple challenge requests e.g. due to unsynchronized DNS zones, inappropriate firewall rules, or because challenge responses are deprovisioned after the first request counter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.6&quot;&gt;RFC 8555.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid in a gradual roll-out of the new multiple validation requirement we will be deploying a temporary exception list. ACME Account IDs and domain names on this list will only require the primary datacentre request to succeed, maintaining our pre-existing validation strategy for those entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will initially populate this list with domains that we anticipate, based on our logs, will have trouble with multi-perspective validation. We will only do this in the case where the associated ACME account has specified contact information to allow communicating that they’re on the temporary exception list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have tested your integration in the staging environment and have found incompatibility with multi-perspective validation you may request to be added to the temporary exception list with this Google form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/9QN7dxALJVAoRjMKA&quot;&gt;https://forms.gle/9QN7dxALJVAoRjMKA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is strictly a temporary measure and on &lt;strong&gt;June 1st, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; we will be removing the exception list entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve updated our original API announcement to include details on how to request being added to the temporary exception list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;quote no-group&quot; data-username=&quot;cpu&quot; data-post=&quot;1&quot; data-topic=&quot;112253&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have tested your integration in the staging environment and have found incompatibility with multi-perspective validation you may request to be added to the temporary exception list with this Google form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/9QN7dxALJVAoRjMKA&quot;&gt;https://forms.gle/9QN7dxALJVAoRjMKA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;quote no-group&quot; data-username=&quot;cpu&quot; data-post=&quot;1&quot; data-topic=&quot;112253&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://sjc4.discourse-cdn.com/letsencrypt/user_avatar/community.letsencrypt.org/cpu/40/8127_2.png&quot; class=&quot;avatar&quot;/&gt; cpu:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday February 19th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; we’ll turn on &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/validating-challenges-from-multiple-network-vantage-points/40955&quot;&gt;stricter validation requirements&lt;/a&gt; in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change is now live in the production environment. For more information about multi-perspective validation and how we use it to protect the security and integrity of Web PKI, check out our latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2020/02/19/multi-perspective-validation.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barron’s senior editor Jack Hough discusses how coronavirus is affecting Apple’s sales and production in China, Facebook’s slowed earnings growth and Microsoft stock hitting an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc&lt;/a&gt; is slated to begin a tax trial in a San Francisco court on Tuesday, as the Internal Revenue Service tries to convince a judge the world’s largest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; company owes more than $9 billion linked to its decision to shift profits to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; expects will take three to four weeks, could see top executives including hardware chief Andrew Bosworth and Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer called to testify, according to a document the company filed in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witness list also includes Naomi Gleit and Javier Olivan, veterans of Facebook’s aggressive growth team, and Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bloomberg-dropped-9m-on-facebook-ads-in-one-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BLOOMBERG DROPPED $9M ON FACEBOOK ADS IN ONE WEEK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS argues that Facebook understated the value of the intellectual property it sold to an Irish subsidiary in 2010 while building out global operations, a move common among U.S. multinationals. Ireland has lower corporate tax rates than the United States, so the move reduced the company’s tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the arrangement, Facebook’s subsidiaries pay royalties to the U.S.-based parent for access to its trademark, users and platform technologies. From 2010 to 2016, Facebook Ireland paid Facebook U.S. more than $14 billion in royalties and cost-sharing payments, according to the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said the low valuation reflected the risks associated with Facebook’s international expansion, which took place in 2010 before its IPO and the development of its most lucrative digital advertising products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-eu-hate-speech-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FACEBOOK WARNS EU HATE SPEECH RULES WOULD STIFLE INNOVATION, FREE EXPRESSION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook Ireland and Facebook’s other foreign affiliates - not Facebook US - led the high-risk, and ultimately successful, international effort to sell Facebook ads,” the company said in a pre-trial memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is the world’s second-biggest seller of online ads after Alphabet Inc’s Google. Monthly users of its core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxbusiness.onelink.me/Zkcx?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxbusinesssaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxbusiness.com%2Fapps-products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertie Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company stood by the decisions in 2010 when it “had no mobile advertising revenue, its international business was nascent and its digital advertising products were unproven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the IRS prevails, Facebook would face an additional federal tax liability of up to $9 billion, plus interest and any penalties, the company estimated in a recent securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;

VCs have been attracted to Lambda’s ability to rapidly grow its enrollment via online-only instruction and the no up-front cost tuition enabled by the ISA model. But most likely it’s because you’ve seen the company’s ubiquitous Facebook ads, or read some of the seemingly endless tweets about the company written by its executives, in particular its founder, Austen Allred. I personally became interested in the school after seeing a (now deleted) tweet by one of Lambda’s executives, Trevor McKendrick, in which he claimed that “if you don’t think Lambda is at least a $100B company you don’t understand the American economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

Internal company documents obtained and reviewed by Intelligencer, plus interviews with former staff and students show a company selling unprepared students an incomplete education, fueled by overpromising marketing and misleading, if not downright fraudulent, figures.&lt;/p&gt;

His previous work was mostly concerned with “growth hacking,” which is Silicon Valley jargon for finding underappreciated (or, less charitably, underhanded) ways of marketing something. He’s also published several articles about entrepreneurship — including one with the inauspicious title “Successful Entrepreneurs Are Usually Liars.”&lt;/p&gt;

The industry got going in 2011, when start-ups were in vogue, and the dominant economic narrative of the day was that high unemployment was explained in part by a “skills gap” that retraining could solve. This was the era when people wrote articles with titles like “Why Everyone Should Learn to Code,” and boot camps rushed to fill this apparent need. There was hope that technology could solve its own economic divide between the haves and have-nots — or rather, the code literate and illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bfq001e2c6k98tibno2@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;62&quot;&gt;Nearly a decade later, the boot-camp boom is over. Unemployment has dropped, and the “skills gap” has come under fire as an explanation for labor-market slack, especially now that the labor market has tightened. Most large boot camps have been sold or shut down, as enthusiasm gave way to the sober economics of running a for-profit school. Most, except for Lambda School.&lt;/p&gt;

It is currently valued at $150M, an impressive sum for a company that only began fundraising in August of 2017. Unfortunately, there’s very little evidence that Lambda is able to improve where other boot camps have failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bfh001a2c6kxap0wify@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;82&quot;&gt;The point of a coding boot camp, obviously, is to help you get a better job. Lambda’s claim, reproduced on its website, that “86% of Lambda School graduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year” is an understandably attractive proposition for students — and a key pillar of Lambda’s marketing. Students I talked to confirmed that the feeling that it was likely that they would be able to land high-paying jobs was a key part of deciding to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bfh001b2c6kzer14sf4@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;97&quot;&gt;However, a May 2019 Lambda School investment memo — entitled “Human Capital: The Last Unoptimized Asset Class” — written for Y Combinator and obtained by Intelligencer, tells a very different story. In a section warning that student-debt collections may prove too low, it matter-of-factly states that, “We’re at roughly 50% placement for cohorts that are 6 months graduated.” A recent interviewee for work at Lambda School also confirmed to me that the company’s own internal numbers, which the interviewee was provided as part of their interview process, seem to indicate a roughly 50 percent or lower placement rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/ck6tc93tf0040uwye4namkp1d@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-480&quot; data-name=&quot;/172968584/Intelligencer&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250,300x252,320x100, 1030x590, 325x508, 325x204, 320x50&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-hq3ASwQ0&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/ck6tc93tf0042uwyesrwn2l6b@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-480-768&quot; data-name=&quot;/172968584/Intelligencer&quot; data-sizes=&quot;468x60,480x60,300x250&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-9QCsmq67&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bdz00142c6kvmeygq3l@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;127&quot;&gt;So where does that 86 percent figure come from? Lambda has reported graduate-outcome statistics at the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR), a voluntary trade organization of coding boot camps whose purpose is to ensure that participating schools publish truthful information about student outcomes. Allred has often used this report to defend his company online. But where other boot camps have multiple reports spanning many student cohorts, Lambda has only reported statistics for its first 71 graduates — 86 percent of who, the school claims, found jobs. Sheree Speakman, the CEO of CIRR, told me that Lambda has not undergone the standard independent auditing for the sole report it has submitted, and that her communications to Lambda School regarding further reporting and auditing have gone unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/ck6tc93tf0041uwyecsrnn6r4@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-768-1180&quot; data-name=&quot;/172968584/Intelligencer&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleTablet&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-rCA07lhj&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9be800162c6k8lwfxpfl@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;119&quot;&gt;Lambda’s former director of career readiness, Sabrina Baez, told me that placing Lambda’s first batch of students was extremely difficult, largely owing to how underdeveloped the curriculum was at the time. When asked about Lambda’s claim that 86 percent of its first graduates were placed within six months, she told me, “I would say out of that 71 students, within six months of them graduating it was probably a 50-60 percent placement rate,” and added that Allred sometimes exaggerated student-placement progress on Twitter — recalling, as an example, an instance in which she told Allred that a student might receive an offer soon, only to find out later that he had tweeted that the student had already received an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;clay-subheader&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck6tc9bd3000z2c6k7x9cv1t0@published&quot;&gt;Income Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bg6001h2c6kwnap0xs2@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;104&quot;&gt;Lambda is also unusual in that it does not charge an upfront tuition to attend. Its home page proclaims, “We don’t get paid until you do, so we’re in this together, from your first day of classes to your first day on the job.” Lambda School is free, but with an asterisk: To attend, you sign a contract that says that if you get a tech job paying $50K or more, you have to pay 17 percent of your pre-tax income to Lambda School for two years, or until you pay back $30K, whichever comes first. These are called Income Share Agreements, or ISAs.&lt;/p&gt;

The allure is that you don’t need to trust any particular authority on whether the school is good — Lambda is putting its money where its mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bgi001o2c6k28u9bw8c@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;103&quot;&gt;Only, it’s not always clear to students who actually owns these ISAs. Last year, Lambda partnered with Edly, an ISA marketplace co-founded by former Merrill Lynch banker Chris Ricciardi, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135134/lambda-school-students-edly-isa-debt-swapping-partnership-shares-investors&quot;&gt;grandfather of collateralized debt obligations&lt;/a&gt;,” to sell Lambda ISAs to investors. &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-we-learn-lambda-income-sharing-agreements/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in August 2019 that, “For about half of the ISAs, the company sells the rights to a portion of its returns to investors; in return, it gets cash up front.” On Twitter, Allred has vociferously denied this claim, suggesting that the author of the piece was mistaken. In October, he tweeted, “We never, ever get paid up front for ISAs.”&lt;/p&gt;

These documents show that, as recently as August 2018, a hedge fund paid $10K to purchase half of Lambda School’s ISAs. In fact, Allred lamented not being able to accept a better deal from a second fund because the deal with the first fund came with a two-year exclusivity agreement. Students I spoke to were entirely unaware of this practice, and were surprised to learn that Lambda was selling their ISAs. This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135134/lambda-school-students-edly-isa-debt-swapping-partnership-shares-investors&quot;&gt;the Verge reported&lt;/a&gt;, Edly began removing references to Lambda on its website. The school’s secret financing arrangements are a violation of Lambda’s central promise to its students — that Lambda only makes money when the students make money.&lt;/p&gt;

Lambda’s educational model hinges on student-contractors called Team Leads (TLs) — students who, two months into their education, defer another two months in order to become teaching assistants tasked with taking attendance, checking in with other students, and answering questions. These student-contractors are paid roughly $13 an hour and have only just learned the material they are then tasked with explaining to the next batch of students. One student told me he was given no training on how to be a TL and spent many hours on devising curriculum and exercises to help other students. Another student, Erica Thompson, told me that TLs “are hired on a Friday and start on Monday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bgf001m2c6kao15wtmf@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;129&quot;&gt;TLs are roughly analogous to graduate-student instructors at universities, but with far less experience with the material. Worse, they’re sometimes tasked with filling in the holes of the start-up’s curriculum development. Two dozen TLs were asked to quickly develop a new curriculum to teach React Hooks, a new addition to the popular JavaScript library. After the students rushed to complete this task, it became clear that the instructor who had assigned them the project had acted without approval. Their work was thrown out and quickly replaced with material copied from other online tutorials. This appears to be a common strategy for Lambda’s curriculum development. Another student described material copied from a popular course on Udemy, an online learning platform, handed out on Slack as supplemental material for struggling students.&lt;/p&gt;

As Zoe Schiffer and Megan Farokhmanesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free&quot;&gt;reported this week at the Verge&lt;/a&gt;, the Lambda enrollment process is haphazard and unreliable, and the curriculum is unlikely to help students pass even a first-round programming interview. For some students, the experience has been so disappointing that they’ve begun to organize. In a group letter to the school’s administration, Bethany Surber, a student spokesperson for a group enrolled in Lambda’s UX program, objected to the “substandard, disorganized, or completely lacking curriculum delivered to us by Lambda School.” Surber and her group are seeking to negotiate the cancellation of their ISAs.&lt;/p&gt;

When Allred arrived, wearing a baseball cap branded with his company’s logo, I asked him about the discrepancy in the advertised student-placement rate and what he reported to his investors. At first, he told me that the 50 percent number in the memo referred to “student[s] making more than $50K.” When I reminded him that his marketing materials claimed that 86 percent of all graduates make at least that much, he admitted that some student cohorts had placement rates as low as 50 percent, and suggested that because the section of the memo concerned risks, “We’re going to pick our lowest number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bgg001n2c6ka8qgmdd2@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;146&quot;&gt;I asked about the documents that showed Lambda outright selling ISAs, and he told me — contra earlier claims on Twitter — “that was true in the early days of Lambda School, but that’s not true today.” These days, Allred insists, the school doesn’t sell but instead “finances” ISAs: “We get an advance from an investor that is backed by the ISA.” Effectively, Lambda takes out a loan that is secured by students’ ISAs, and has to repay that loan with more interest as more students graduate and are placed. Whether or not this counts as “selling” strikes me as a meaningless semantic distinction: Either way, the school receives some money up front and an investor shoulders some of the risk of the ISA not paying out. And either way, Lambda School students don’t know that the school isn’t as incentive-aligned with them as the school’s marketing indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than negotiate with the group as a whole, he told me that he offered to speak with each student individually — weakening the group’s bargaining power — and decide whether their case merited a cancellation of their ISA. From an original 20 signatories on the letter to Lambda, 12 students remain who were willing to commit to group bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking off his hat, he told me that he “doesn’t really have friends,” and used Twitter as a way of having some social interaction. A moment later, he clarified that he felt “an obligation to do everything I can for the students, in a way that I just don’t feel towards friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bfl001d2c6k88dm2a3m@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;112&quot;&gt;It’s hard to believe that line. Lambda’s lies regarding graduate outcomes, financial structure, and curriculum quality are not merely hyperbole to drive sales of a product. The real human cost of underprivileged students who have been sold the dream of a new career is significant. One student I spoke with stretched thin the last of the goodwill from his friends and family to be able to attend Lambda and forego working. Erica is broke and drives for Uber to make ends meet. Students with no safety nets experience real financial pain from the nine-month hiatus from work, in addition to the looming dread of possibly having to pay Lambda $30K one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck6tc9bgb001j2c6k0kelf6xu@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;68&quot;&gt;There is some virtue, still, to Lambda’s mission. Technology and economic change has opened up new job opportunities, and many Americans are desperate to join an industry that promises a future. Coding boot camps offer a kind of solution for one moral conundrum of technology — can we build a future that doesn’t diminish the people who helped us get here? Not, it would seem, through Lambda School.&lt;/p&gt;

Lambda continues to pursue a familiar grow-at-any-cost strategy. Investors now own 40 percent of the company, and Allred now needs to deliver them a return. Lambda’s internal documents show that the school can be profitable so long as at least one in four students manages to find a tech job, and that it intends to enroll more than 10,000 students in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teardown of a $1.25 LED Lightbulb</title>

&lt;br/&gt;Great design! But: 3 circuit boards for the emitters, one circuit board for control electronics.  Not cheap (and cheap is what the market wants over almost any other attribute).&lt;p&gt;You can see the effects of this compromise in a polar graph of the light output with the bulb placed on its side and the light intensity measured in 10 degree increments around the bulb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kwERIY_8Ew/XfC3WIMQP-I/AAAAAAAABQQ/CU7fSF4mgis9zbEOtoH2Tzw1sIPtU5NewCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/light_pattern.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;621&quot; data-original-width=&quot;634&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kwERIY_8Ew/XfC3WIMQP-I/AAAAAAAABQQ/CU7fSF4mgis9zbEOtoH2Tzw1sIPtU5NewCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/light_pattern.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar store bulb in red.  Philips in Blue.  The distance from the center to the line is a measure of light intensity; the further away the greater the light in that direction.  Note how the Philips bulb pushes the light to the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both bulbs are rated for 800 lm of light output so the area of each graph should be about  the same.  One might speculate that the dollar store bulbs claim of &quot;800 lm&quot; seems a bit suspect... it's close but the area for the Philips bulb seems larger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to the circuit board,  model of cost effective design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tXl3HL5o-S0/XfC45z576wI/AAAAAAAABQc/2Z_PHqylrXo3cjBEc_HjowPJN9VY_6q7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pcb_explain.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;786&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tXl3HL5o-S0/XfC45z576wI/AAAAAAAABQc/2Z_PHqylrXo3cjBEc_HjowPJN9VY_6q7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/pcb_explain.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Eleven LEDs, one bridge rectifier 2 resistors, and a controller IC... and that's it!  On the other side is the large smoothing capacitor. Electrolytic: so it's only worth ~3 cents in high volume.&lt;p&gt;The 120 Volts enters into the PCB from the bottom, the bridge rectifier converts the voltage to DC, the large electrolytic smooths the voltage and presents the ~100 V DC to the controller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controller is state-of-cheap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XuzEvng2Sfg/XfC5kqSAPhI/AAAAAAAABQ0/I6KGdkmxZV8xOegaoH3Fx3pem6WUFYn4wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/dollar_store_led-0001.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;838&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XuzEvng2Sfg/XfC5kqSAPhI/AAAAAAAABQ0/I6KGdkmxZV8xOegaoH3Fx3pem6WUFYn4wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/dollar_store_led-0001.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Top 1/2 of die is a large transistor which chops the voltage at a high enough speed that flicker is not perceived by the LEDs   Bottom half is the control logic... not much more that 50 transistors tops.  The design is so clever that even an  output capacitor for smoothing is not needed.  Here is the die mark, vendor unknown:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hHq2FW_OT9k/XfC6lDSTUZI/AAAAAAAABRA/WNvwsyF4U8k_BSMgyFZRZYFH3uAQGyQgACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/dollar_store_led-0003.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;541&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;108&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hHq2FW_OT9k/XfC6lDSTUZI/AAAAAAAABRA/WNvwsyF4U8k_BSMgyFZRZYFH3uAQGyQgACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/dollar_store_led-0003.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a resistor in the base of the bulb (look at the cross section above). When one cross sections it (as I have done in the photo below, one can see the coil of wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KRDymxASxIY/XfC7vNS-qcI/AAAAAAAABRc/DqMcUId1now9KUwmBWb5QYjg5vOjUzjEwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/resistor.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;703&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KRDymxASxIY/XfC7vNS-qcI/AAAAAAAABRc/DqMcUId1now9KUwmBWb5QYjg5vOjUzjEwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/resistor.JPG&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The strange thing is that I think this element acts like a fuse... however it's wire onto the neutral leg which is very wrong from an electrical safety perspective.  A fuse should be put on the hot leg as close to the power entry as possible.   The reasoning being that if the fuse pops it removes the hot voltage from as much of the assembly as possible.  A fused neutral design would leave all of the bulb electronics hot.   Strange.&lt;p&gt;Well there you have it.  The end state of LED bulb construction.  Just like the incandescent bulb things probably won't change much for the next 100 years unless some even newer disruptive technology comes over the horizon.....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How 1500 bytes became the MTU of the internet</title>
<link>https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/why-is-ethernet-mtu-1500</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/why-is-ethernet-mtu-1500</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Feb 19 2020&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/eIy8Yr8TLa&quot; alt=&quot;10BASE ethernet card&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3Com_3C509BC_Ethernet_NIC.jpg&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0 - Dmitry Nosachev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet&quot;&gt;Ethernet&lt;/a&gt; is everywhere, tens of thousands of hardware vendors speak and implement it. However almost every ethernet link has one number in common, the MTU:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ ip l
1: lo: &amp;lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&amp;gt; mtu 65536 state UNKNOWN
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp5s0: &amp;lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&amp;gt; mtu 1500 state UP 
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) states how big a single packet can be. Generally speaking, when you are talking to devices on your own LAN the MTU will be around 1500 bytes and the internet runs almost universally on 1500 as well. However, this does not mean that these link layer technologies can’t transmit bigger packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, 802.11 (better known as WiFi) has a MTU of 2304 bytes, or if your network is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface&quot;&gt;FDDI&lt;/a&gt; then you have a MTU around 4352 bytes. Ethernet itself has the concept of “jumbo frames”, where the MTU can be set up to 9000 bytes (on supporting NICs, Switches and Routers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, almost none of this matters on the internet. Since the backbone of the internet is now mostly made up of ethernet links, the de facto maximum size of a packet is now unofficially set to 1500 bytes to avoid packets being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation&quot;&gt;fragmented&lt;/a&gt; down links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it 1500 is a weird number, we would normally expect a lot of constants in computing to be based around mathematical constants, like powers of 2. 1500, however fits none of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where did 1500 come from, and why are we still using it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The magic number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethernet’s first major break into the world came in the form of 10BASE-2 (cheapernet) and 10BASE-5 (thicknet), the numbers indicating roughly how many hundred meters a single network segment could span over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there were many competing protocols at the time, and hardware limits existed, the original creator notes this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/1hhfq2UR8P&quot;&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt; that the packet buffer memory requirements had some play in the magic 1500 number. (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yeled/status/1230129004482646017&quot;&gt;@yeled&lt;/a&gt; for finding this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, a longer maximum might have been better, but if it increased the cost of NICs during the early days it may have prevented the widespread acceptance of Ethernet, so I’m not really concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However that is not the whole story. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/4Up5QvCjAa&quot;&gt;“Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks” paper from 1980&lt;/a&gt; is a early note of the efficiency cost analysis of larger packets on a network. This being especially important to ethernet at the time, since ethernet networks would ether be sharing the same coax cable between all systems, or there would be ethernet hubs that would only allow one packet at a time to be transmitted around all members of the ethernet segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number had to be picked that would mean that transmission latency on these shared (sometimes busy) segments would not be too high, but also that packet header overhead would not be too much. (see some of the tables on the paper linked above on page 15-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem at best that the engineers at the time picked 1500 bytes, or around 12000 bits as the best “safe” value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then various other transmission systems have come and gone, but the lowest MTU value of them has still been ethernet at 1500 bytes. Going bigger than lowest MTU on a network will either result in IP fragmentation, or the need to do path MTU detection. Both of which have their own sets of problems. Even if sometimes large OS vendors &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nanog.org/mailinglist/mailarchives/old_archive/1998-02/msg00064.html&quot;&gt;dropped the default MTU to even lower at times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The efficiency factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that the internet’s MTU is capped at 1500 mostly due to legacy latency numbers and hardware limits, how bad is this for the efficiency of the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/bqMErxwWkc&quot; alt=&quot;AMS-IX breakdown of ethernet frame sizes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at data from a major internet traffic exchange point (AMS-IX), we see that at least 20% of packets transiting the exchange are the maximum size. We can also see the total traffic of the LAN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/YdKtqySe49&quot; alt=&quot;AMS-IX Traffic graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you combine these two graphs, you get something that roughly looks like this. This is an estimation of how much traffic each packet size bucket is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/E1JFG3KuhI&quot; alt=&quot;AMS-IX traffic by packet size bracket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if we look at just the traffic that all of those ethernet preambles and headers cause, we get the same graph but with different scales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/5qKGyFM85R&quot; alt=&quot;AMS-IX traffic by packet size overhead&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows a great deal of bandwidth being spent on headers for the largest packet class. Since the peak traffic shows the biggest packet bucket reading at around 246GBit/s of overhead we can assume that if we had all adopted jumbo frames while we had the chance to, this overhead would only be around 41GBit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think at this point, the ship has sailed to do this on the wider internet. While some &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200108213905/https://he.net/ip_transit.html&quot;&gt;internet transport carriers operate on 9000 MTU&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority don’t, and changing the internet’s mind collectively has been shown time and time again to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment&quot;&gt;prohibitively difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have more context on the history of 1500 bytes, please email them into &lt;code&gt;ethernet1500@benjojo.co.uk&lt;/code&gt;. Sadly the manuals, mailing list posts, and other context to this are disappearing fast without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you liked this kind of stuff, you may like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk&quot;&gt;rest of the blog&lt;/a&gt; even if it is generally more geared towards the modern day abuses of standards :).

<title>Internet Society told to halt .org sale by its own advisory council</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/19/internet_society_org_sale/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/19/internet_society_org_sale/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet Society's own members are now opposing its sale of the .org internet registry to an unknown private equity firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chapters Advisory Council, the official voice of Internet Society (ISOC) members, will vote this month on whether to approve a formal recommendation that the society “not proceed [with the sale] unless a number of conditions are met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those conditions largely comprise the publication of additional details and transparency regarding ISOC's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/17/icann_org_purchase/&quot;&gt;controversial sell-off of .org&lt;/a&gt;. Despite months of requests, neither the society nor the proposed purchaser, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/03/internet_society_org/&quot;&gt;Ethos Capital&lt;/a&gt;, have disclosed critical elements of the deal, including who would actually own the registry if the sale went through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, word has reached us that Ethos Capital attempted to broker a secret peace treaty this coming weekend in Washington DC by inviting key individuals to a closed-door meeting with the goal of thrashing out an agreement all sides would be happy with. After Ethos insisted the meeting be kept brief, and a number of those opposed to the sale declined to attend, Ethos's funding for attendees' flights and accommodation was suddenly withdrawn, and the plan to hold a confab fell apart, we understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/11/20/shutterstock_internet_money.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;Someone not happy with the internet and money&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Sale comes within months of DNS overseer pushing through controversial contract change&quot;&gt;Internet world despairs as non-profit .org sold for $$$$ to private equity firm, price caps axed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/20/org_registry_sale_shambles/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISOC – and .org's current operator, the ISOC-controlled Public Interest Registry (PIR) – are still hoping to push DNS overseer ICANN to make a decision on the .org sale before the end of the month. But that looks increasingly unlikely following an aggressive letter from ICANN's external lawyers last week insisting ICANN will take as much time as it feels necessary to review the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall lack of transparency around the $1.13bn deal has led California’s Attorney General to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/31/icann_dot_org_sale/&quot;&gt;demand&lt;/a&gt; documents relating to the sale – and ISOC’s chapters are demanding the same information as a pre-condition to any sale in their proposed advice to the ISOC board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That information includes: full details of the transaction; a financial breakdown of what Ethos Capital intends to do with .org’s 10 million internet addresses; binding commitments on limiting price increases and free speech protections; and publication of the bylaws and related corporate documents for both the replacement to the current registry operator, PIR, and the proposed “Stewardship Council” which Ethos claims will give .org users a say in future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disregarded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a feeling amongst chapters that ISOC seems to have disregarded community participation, failed to properly account for the potential community impact, and misread the community mindset around the .ORG TLD,” the Chapters Advisory Council's proposed advice to the ISOC board – a copy of which &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; has seen – states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the advisory council has no legal ability to stop ISOC, if the proposed advice is approved by vote, and the CEO and board of trustees push ahead with the sale regardless, it could have severe repercussions for the organization’s non-profit status, and would further undermine ISOC’s position that the sale will “support the Internet Society’s vision that the Internet is for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With opposition to the deal growing within the internet community, and following an abortive attempt by PIR to force ICANN to make a decision this month, it looks increasingly likely that the .org sell-off will fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ICANN lawyers' letter, the organization rejected PIR’s insistence that any decision be limited to technical security and stability considerations, and said all parties “have long recognized the unique public-interest-focused nature of the .ORG domain, and ICANN's contractual role in evaluating proposed changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN also &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/levee-to-boglivi-13feb20-en.pdf&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] “any artificial restriction on the scope of ICANN's analysis” and noted “the obvious importance to the public interest of its operation.” It concluded: “ICANN is reviewing PIR's request for change of control in light of all of the relevant circumstances, and it looks forward to your client's continued cooperation in this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ISOC and Ethos have been relatively open about the fact that any deal would need to be concluded quickly. As such, the longer discussions persist, the more risky the deal looks. That’s not all, however: anger at ISOC’s board from its members is growing and the furor risks damaging the organization itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public support is lacking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under US law, for an organization to be tax exempt, at least one third of the organization’s revenue must come from donors who each individually give less than two per cent of overall receipts, something called the “public support test.” ISOC does not meet that test because the vast majority of its income comes from a single source: the sale of .org domains, paid through a separate non-profit organization, PIR, that ISOC controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an exception, however. An organization can retain public charity status if public support is at least 10 per cent of revenues but an organization must assert it is operating as a charity, rather than a foundation, and is actively working to get its public support percentage up to 33 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, every year since its inception, ISOC has included the same explanation in its tax documents for why it should be granted charity status despite not meeting the 33 per cent test: because it is doing great work with its members around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Internet Society is organized and operated to attract new and additional support on a continuous basis. Internet Society involves both individual and corporate members in its activities,” the explanation reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption from tax authorities is that a non-profit will only spend a short period of time – one or two years – below that 33 per cent threshold. But ISOC has never met the threshold since it took over .org in 2003, and has relied instead in a slowly increasing percentage: 13.9 per cent in 2013; 17.1 per cent in 2015; and 19.5 per cent in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, while ISOC is not in any way reliant on its members to function financially, it is reliant on their existence and the work they do to justify its tax-exempt status. The proposed .org sale is deeply unpopular with ISOC chapters, and any break between the headquarters in Virginia, USA, and its global members risks fracturing that corporate balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transparency? We've heard of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension has been simmering for a long time, as made clear by an earlier recommendation by the Chapters Advisory Council that the ISOC board improve its transparency and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That recommendation was rejected by the board chair who formally &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://isoc.app.box.com/s/awmhwc68luxp5s9mnvfx73j5v1qstodi&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: “Let me point out that no matter how strict we make our bylaws regarding board transparency, the community will always need to put a certain level of trust in its trustees (thus the name).” It concluded: “In our humble opinion, this board already works in a very transparent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2020/02/12/shutterstock_safe.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;safe&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Online security process stalled by offline security screw-up&quot;&gt;Internet's safe-keepers forced to postpone crucial DNSSEC root key signing ceremony – no, not a hacker attack, but because they can't open a safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lack of transparency was never more clear than when the ISOC board claimed to have met for two weeks in November to discuss the Ethos Capital offer to buy .org, but made no mention of the proposal and only made ISOC members and chapters aware of the decision after it had been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a spotlight on ISOC’s secretive deliberations – and with board members now claiming they are subject to a non-disclosure agreement over the sale – the organization has added &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.internetsociety.org/board-of-trustees/minutes/147&quot;&gt;skeleton minutes&lt;/a&gt; that provide little or no insight into deliberations. It is not clear when those minutes were added – no update date is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The primary purpose of the Chapters Advisory Council shall be to channel and facilitate advice and recommendations to and from the President and Board of Trustees of the Internet Society in a bottom up manner, on any matters of concern or interest to the Chapter AC and ISOC Chapters,” reads the official description of the council on ISOC’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ethos having failed to broker a secret deal, and ICANN indicating that it will consider the public interest in deciding whether to approve the sale, if ISOC’s advisory council does vote to advise the board not to move forward with the sale, the Internet Society will face a stark choice: stick by the secretive billionaires funding the purchase of .org with the added risk of blowing up the entire organization; or walk away from the deal. ®&lt;/p&gt;
