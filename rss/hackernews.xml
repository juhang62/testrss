<title>Joi Ito Resigns from M.I.T. Media Lab After Outcry over Jeffrey Epstein Ties</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nearly a month after his death, Jeffrey Epstein continues to haunt some of America’s most prestigious institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Saturday, a prominent figure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stepped down after the disclosure of his efforts to conceal his financial connections to Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell last month while facing federal sex trafficking charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Almost immediately, the M.I.T. official, Joichi Ito, left the boards of three other organizations: the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and The New York Times Company, where he had been a board member since 2012. He also left a visiting professorship at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito, the tech evangelist and master networker who led the M.I.T. Media Lab — a program that prides itself on contrarian thinking — acknowledged last week that he had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/business/media/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joichi-ito.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;received $1.7 million from Mr. Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, including $1.2 million for his own outside investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,” Mr. Ito wrote in an email on Saturday to M.I.T.’s provost, Martin A. Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito’s resignation came less than a day after &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article in The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; described the measures that he and other media lab officials took to conceal its relationship with Mr. Epstein. The internal emails, which a former media lab employee shared with The New York Times, described the handling of donations that Mr. Epstein made and apparently solicited from the rich and powerful over the years, including a $2 million gift from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an email in October 2014 — six years after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida — Mr. Ito wrote that the gift from Mr. Gates had been “directed by Jeffrey Epstein.” A development official at the media lab, Peter Cohen, wrote in a subsequent email, “For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey’s name as the impetus for this gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Gates said Mr. Epstein had been introduced to Mr. Gates as a person interested in helping increase philanthropy. “Although Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is simply not true,” the statement said. “And any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Gates — one of the world’s richest men and perhaps its most generous philanthropist — is one of many powerful people to face scrutiny for their connections to Mr. Epstein. President Trump and former President Bill Clinton have been forced to explain their associations with him. So have Britain’s Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists and business executives including Leslie Wexner, the chief executive of L Brands, and Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms. R. Alexander Acosta, who as a federal prosecutor was involved in the plea agreement with Mr. Epstein in 2008, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/acosta-resigns-trump.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stepped down as labor secretary&lt;/a&gt; after that deal was heavily criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito’s resignation from M.I.T. was followed in quick succession by announcements from other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The MacArthur Foundation said reports about his actions, if true, were not in keeping with its values. “Most importantly, our hearts go out to the girls and women who survived the abuse of Jeffrey Epstein,” the foundation said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, and the company’s president, Mark Thompson, wrote an email to staff members that Mr. Ito had stepped down, effective immediately. “Our newsroom will continue its aggressive reporting on Mr. Epstein, investigating both the individuals and the broader systems of power that enabled him for so many years,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Signe Swenson, who served as a development associate and alumni relations coordinator at the M.I.T. Media Lab from 2014 to 2016, shared the internal emails concerning Mr. Epstein with The Times. She said she had told supervisors several times of her “disgust” at Mr. Epstein’s involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“That was never listened to,” Ms. Swenson, who worked under Mr. Cohen, said in an interview on Saturday. Ms. Swenson shared the correspondence after consulting with the organization Whistleblower Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She said she learned of Mr. Epstein’s connection with the media lab when she interviewed for a position in March 2014, and told Mr. Cohen that M.I.T. listed Mr. Epstein as “disqualified” as a donor. She said Mr. Cohen replied that Mr. Ito had a relationship with the wealthy financier. In one 2014 email that Ms. Swenson shared, Mr. Ito wrote about a $100,000 donation from Mr. Epstein, asking the development staff members to “make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito took over the Media Lab in 2011 following a rapid ascent in the tech world that made him an unorthodox choice to lead an academic program, but not the freewheeling media lab. He was a two-time college dropout who had run a nightclub, then ran a string of internet companies and invested early in Twitter, Kickstarter and Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was also a master networker — one who visited the Obama White House to discuss artificial intelligence and became friends with the respected Harvard lawyer Lawrence Lessig after criticizing Mr. Lessig’s book when he gave a talk in Japan. Mr. Lessig later put Mr. Ito on the board of Creative Commons, a nonprofit advocate for public intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito’s ability to connect with both students and wealthy donors had helped him raise at least $50 million for the Media Lab, a sort of academic skunkworks. It has contributed to the development of technology related to touchscreens and GPS, is home to a program dedicated to democratizing access to outer space and hands out $250,000 awards to those “challenging the norms, rules or laws that sustain society’s injustices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Ito faced significant criticism from inside the Media Lab. Two scholars said they would leave at the end of the academic year, with one saying he had urged Mr. Ito not to associate with Mr. Epstein. While Mr. Ito did enjoy the support of many within the lab, there were calls for his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have worked literally for years to try to make STEM fields safe and welcoming, attractive fields for women and girls in the face of crushing sexism and gender bias,” said Kim Holleman, an artist who was a visiting scholar and a research affiliate at the media lab from 2013 through 2017. “It’s humiliating to know that men in these institutions, in 2019, still think so little of women’s dignity and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At a meeting on Wednesday night with media lab personnel, Mr. Ito said he had “screwed up” by accepting the money, but that he had done so after a review by the university and consultation with his advisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Emails shared by a former employee at the Media Lab show that Mr. Epstein solicited a $2 million donation the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Saturday, the university’s president, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/fact-finding-and-action-media-lab&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;L. Rafael Reif, said he had asked&lt;/a&gt; M.I.T.’s general counsel to hire an outside law firm to conduct “an immediate, thorough and independent investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect M.I.T.’s values and prevent such mistakes in the future,” he wrote in an email to the university community. “Our internal review process continues, and what we learn from it will inform the path ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The emails provided by Ms. Swenson outlined the informal role that Mr. Epstein played at the media lab. In the correspondence about the donation from Mr. Gates, Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Ito “did not talk with Bill Gates” and that the program “did not solicit this money.” In another, from May 2014, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Ito discussed Mr. Epstein helping connect the media lab to Mr. Black, the Apollo Global Management founder, who Mr. Epstein had advised on issues including philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Black wanted to make a large donation “in honor of a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous,” and later asked Mr. Ito to find out from Mr. Epstein whether Mr. Black himself wanted to remain anonymous. One email indicated that Mr. Black had given the media lab a gift of $4 million by wire transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Cohen also asked Mr. Ito whether Mr. Black would like a thank-you note from M.I.T.’s president. Mr. Black’s preference would be something “you or Jeffrey knows best,” be wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A spokeswoman for Mr. Black, of Apollo Global Management, did not comment on Saturday. Mr. Black has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-apollo.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sought to distance himself&lt;/a&gt; from Mr. Epstein, describing his interactions with him as limited to tax strategy, estate planning and philanthropic advice. He has also said Apollo had never done business with Mr. Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Cohen, now the director of development for computer and data science initiatives at Brown University, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The departure of Mr. Ito from the media lab came after he spent days &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/business/media/ito-mit-epstein-apology.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;trying to make amends&lt;/a&gt;. At Wednesday’s meeting, which was organized by professors at the program, he reiterated his apology. He described for the first time the amount of money he had received from Mr. Epstein, and said he had twice traveled to Mr. Epstein’s island home in the Caribbean to seek donations. He also told the crowd he had returned one check that Mr. Epstein had sent him earlier this year, after an article in the Miami Herald prompted heavy criticism of Mr. Epstein’s plea agreement in Florida in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But near the end, one of Mr. Ito’s staunchest supporters, Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the media lab, said he had told Mr. Ito to take the money and would do it again. That prompted Mr. Ito to send an email to Mr. Negroponte in the middle of the night, complaining that he was undercutting his ability to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The situation worsened with the disclosure of the lab’s internal emails. An online petition established in support of Mr. Ito put a disclaimer at the top that it had been set up before news of the emails circulated. A few hours later, Mr. Ito tendered the first of several resignations he offered on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By Saturday night, the petition site was no longer online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;ao cp ks kt at&quot;&gt;Despite Amazon’s innovation elsewhere, Goodreads has stagnated for 12 years, and its problems are endless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;e5e9&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l ne nn nh ef no&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;G&quot; class=&quot;np nq nr ns nt nu ge n o gd ab&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/158/1*MaTdjUVgNF2TxZid3f3Sdw.png&quot; width=&quot;79&quot; height=&quot;79&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm ef df&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;oodreads, the largest literary social media network, should be a good gathering place for readers. It is one of the only online communities for people who like to read books, but the service’s apparent monopoly seems to have stopped it from innovating, based on complaints from users and, well, basic observation. As a result, readers don’t have a good, central online community where they can discuss favorite novels or dish about exciting new releases; authors and publishers don’t have a reliable, trustworthy way to promote their books and interact with fans; book clubs and literary publications don’t have a good way to use the site to gain members and foster discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4b3b&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;What Goodreads is good for is keeping your own list of books you want to read or have read this year. It’s a list-making app. And while that’s useful, it doesn’t live up to the company’s full promise of being a haven for readers. Readers and authors deserve a better online community. And while Amazon has at least some nominal interest in improving many of its other products — Alexa, for example, becomes more advanced with each passing year — Goodreads lingers in the dustbin of the early aughts, doomed to the hideous beige design and uninspiring organization of a strip mall doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4cdf&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;“It’s just really clunky and slow,” says Dustin Martin, a reader, Goodreads user, and software engineer. “Even having the resources of Amazon behind it, the site feels like a relic, an early web 2.0 sort of deal. I don’t think I’ve seen real improvement or new features since I started using the site in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;24f2&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Martin brings up the difficulty of searching for books, a feature that numerous other frustrated Goodreads users complained to me about: The search tool is not intuitive, and if the user makes any mistakes, the book may not come up in Goodreads search at all. Even when a book or author is accurately entered into the search bar, the correct result is often, inexplicably, at the bottom of a list following 10 irrelevant other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;191.02201575439&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;14bb&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Further design flaws plague regular Goodreads users. My own biggest trouble — one that was echoed by several other Goodreads users I spoke to — is the opaqueness of the platform’s shelving system. If I want to read a book, I put it on my Want to Read shelf. If I’ve read it, it goes to my Read shelf, and books I’m currently reading appear, obviously, on my Currently Reading shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7830&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;But what if I ditched a book halfway through because I didn’t like it? I can create a DNF (Did Not Finish) shelf, but the way the site is currently designed, it seems as if a book must also appear on one of the shelves created by Goodreads. While it is, according to a Goodreads spokesperson, possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-create-a-shelf-for-a-book-I-couldn-t-finish-1553870934201&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a custom shelf&lt;/a&gt; in which books added are exclusive to that shelf only, not a single person I interviewed was aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;kb b oy oz at&quot;&gt;“The recommendations suck, the lists suck — it’s like 100 lists telling me to read ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ and ‘Harry Potter.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d799&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms pa mu pb mw pc my pd na pe nc&quot;&gt;The ability to privately shelve and annotate books on their lists was another frequent request made by Goodreads users I interviewed. “There’s no way to use Goodreads without your opinions becoming a public statement on the book,” says Kelsey McKinney, a writer at &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Deadspin&lt;/em&gt; and creator of the literary newsletter &lt;a href=&quot;https://kelseymckinney.substack.com/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Written Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It encourages you to read a ton of books but also immediately cast judgment on them.” An easy fix would be private shelves and annotations that would enable users to sort and assess their books without subjecting those opinions to the Goodreads community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7c2d&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;And while Goodreads calls itself “the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations,” many of the 18 or so people I spoke to for this story insisted that, in fact, Goodreads is nearly useless for finding recommendations. “For some reason, Goodreads seems to attract an audience of people with insanely bland and entry-level taste,” Martin says. He points to the site’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Best Books Ever&lt;/a&gt; list, which includes &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, high school curriculum novels, and copious YA. “That would be fine if it didn’t seem to poison the site’s recommendation algorithm, which in my experience is entirely useless.” Gaby, a journalist who requested that only her first name be used because she’s not allowed to speak with press, agrees. “It’s generally not a good place to find new things to read,” she says. “The recommendations suck, the lists suck — it’s like, 100 lists telling me to read &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;afe8&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;One relatively easy solution to this problem would be allowing publications, organizations, clubs, and public figures more prominence on the site. While Goodreads does allow author pages, little work is done to ensure these authors are featured or showcased in any way, and organizations or book clubs, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://girlsnightinclub.com/book-club/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Girl’s Night In&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello-sunshine.com/book-club&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reese’s Book Club&lt;/a&gt;, don’t receive any kind of site promotion or badge at all. Once you do manage to find them, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/345436-reese-s-book-club-x-hello-sunshine&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;site design&lt;/a&gt; looks like a forum from 2007. It’s small, features ugly text, and makes it difficult to navigate or know where to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e296&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;“It would be great to integrate recommendations from news outlets, like the NPR book list that comes out every year, or the monthly &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; lists,” says Paige Newman, a project manager at Disney. “I would just like the select option of ‘Follow &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;’s monthly recommendations.’” Lian Parsons, a journalist, had a similar request for Goodreads. “The review section doesn’t seem to have any particular benchmark in terms of standards,” she says. “While any review is opinion and should be taken with a grain of salt, I feel there are some people who have greater authority/knowledge/level of articulation than others on certain topics. And there’s no way to filter out that kind of quality per se.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;56c7&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;The closest thing to this that I’ve been able to find is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookmarks.reviews/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Book Marks&lt;/a&gt;, a project of the literary website LitHub that aggregates reviews of new books, similar to Rotten Tomatoes. It’s a wonderful resource, but it’s a multistep process to find a book on Book Marks, decide if I want to read it or not, and then add it to my Want to Read shelf. If those reviews were integrated into the Goodreads platform — or if Book Marks offered its own private shelving for users — it’d make for a much easier experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dfe5&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Further integrating publications, official book clubs, and book bloggers with large followings into the Goodreads ecosystem wouldn’t just add credibility to much of the site’s user-created content — it might also make the site easier for people on the publishing side of things. Several editors, publicists, authors, and other book publishing professionals told me they’re frustrated with the site’s difficult-to-understand and expensive promotion system, which privileges large publishers with huge budgets and makes it harder for indie authors and publishing houses to break through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e19&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Goodreads “posits itself as a platform for discovering and uplifting literature but requires publishers to pay so much money to have their books even remotely accessible,” says Allison Paller, a book publicist. She points out that much of the content in newsletters is sponsored, which can leave out independent book publishers with small marketing budgets, and giveaways — which aren’t clearly marked as sponsored — cost at least $119 for a “standard” print or e-book giveaway and $599 for a “premium” giveaway, “which is negligible for big companies but a big deal to small publishers.” (&lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; confirmed this by looking at Goodreads’ 2019 rate sheet for advertisements.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0549&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Michael, a successful author who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation by Goodreads trolls, tells me that he was originally excited about the platform, only to become discouraged by the high numbers of trolls and scammy reviewers on the site. “The thing that probably turned me off the most is that years before my second novel was finished, people were leaving one-star reviews for it,” he says. “If Goodreads could prevent people from leaving these kind of damaging reviews without having read the book, yes, I would take it more seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;

A review from an author who requested anonymity for their candor.
&lt;p id=&quot;22af&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;It isn’t even just that the reviews are demoralizing and depressing; according to Michael and several other book publishing professionals I spoke to, having a lot of positive reviews privileges your book in the Goodreads promotion ecosystem, making it more likely that books will be mentioned in end-of-year reviews and, of course, be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/2018/rules&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2018&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have a massive influx of Goodreads users who, for whatever reason, dislike you as a person, they can leave reviews indicating that your book is awful, destroying an author’s chance of successful promotion on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;28e7&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;There’s also the issue of bogus positive reviews, which can come from a number of different places, according to two sources who work in the industry. “You can pay services that will get people to recommend you on Goodreads, which is hilarious,” says Sarah Solomon, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600334/guac-is-extra-but-so-am-i-by-sarah-solomon/9781576879139/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Guac Is Extra But So Am I: The Reluctant Adult’s Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “As if authors make enough to pump money into such a misleading and awful practice.” One such service, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appsally.com/products/goodreads-ratings-reviews/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jv jw jx jy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AppSally&lt;/a&gt;, promises “real, legit and non-incentivised” reviews for the low price of $40 for 20 reviews. In a Facebook message — the only way press can get in touch with the company — AppSally told &lt;em class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; that concerned clients can request the company to “ask [a reviewer] for summary of the book” in order to validate that the reviews are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;op&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;e374&quot; class=&quot;oq or os ap kb b ks ot ou ov ow ox nc&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;kb b oy oz at&quot;&gt;Readers are stuck in a kind of literary social network purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e231&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms pa mu pb mw pc my pd na pe nc&quot;&gt;Not everyone hates Goodreads, of course. I talked to a handful of people who generally like the platform and have only a small complaint here and there that they think would make the site better. Anna Koch, a Berlin-based community manager, told me she loves that Goodreads allowed her to find books not often recommended in the German book market. A group that Koch was in “read a book about the Herero and Nama genocide by the German government,” she says. “I learned a lot about the genocide that I wasn’t told in school, and people around the world learned the German perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;655b&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Overall, though, the Goodreads users I chatted with were frustrated by the ugly design and poor functionality of the site overall yet feel like they have few places to turn to keep track of books they’ve read or want to read. A few mentioned that they’ve taken to Instagram to talk about books they’ve read or want to read, but even that is an imperfect system, in particular since Instagram is a visual social network, and books are, by and large, primarily made up of text. It’s a union that works only because there’s nothing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e88&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;But there could be. Ben Pierratt, a designer, and Buzz Anderson, a tech veteran formerly of Apple and Square, told me they’ve been casually toying with the idea of building a social network for readers, though they’ve not committed to anything yet. Even many of the changes Goodreads users recommend wouldn’t necessarily be a super-heavy lift; a couple site tweaks here and there would make the platform infinitely more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8d37&quot; class=&quot;mp mq dr ap mr b ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Until then, readers are stuck in a kind of literary social network purgatory: They have a place to go, but it’s just not very good. In the age of every kind of social network you could imagine, you’d think Amazon would cough up the dough to improve its platform for discussing the product that made Amazon what it is in the first place. Until then, readers will linger in the beige dreariness of a website designed long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-caption-content&quot;&gt;Workers are fueling a renaissance in American cities that lie outside the major job hubs. Here, a neighborhood in Idaho.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit article__inset__image__caption__credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsj-article-credit-tag&quot;&gt;Photo:&lt;/span&gt; Todd Meier for the Wall Street Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Swift grew tired of the Los Angeles area a few years ago so she decided to leave—and take her job with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Swift kept her role in health-care information-technology consulting, and her California salary, when she and her family settled in a suburb of Boise, Idaho. Her employer didn’t mind that she started working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Swift joined a group of workers fueling a renaissance in American cities that lie outside the major job hubs. People who do their jobs from home, freelance or constantly travel for work are migrating away from expensive urban centers such as Los Angeles and San Francisco toward cheaper, smaller cities including Boise; Denver; Austin, Texas; and Portland, Ore.; according to economists and local residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has brought a boom to these midsize cities, and while the ultimate effects aren’t yet clear, the development comes with a few downsides. Many places are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/boise-idaho-feels-the-growing-pains-of-a-surging-population-1523793600?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;dealing with growing pains&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-boise-and-grand-rapids-the-housing-market-looks-red-hot-11565521202?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;fast-rising home prices&lt;/a&gt; and traffic congestion, but aren’t accruing all the economic benefits, such as the deep investments companies often make in the areas where they are based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the bummers is that they are not necessarily joining the workforce,” said Sheila Smith, a real-estate agent in Boise. Many of the out-of-town arrivals she sells to work from home or commute to jobs in distant cities, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, workers tend to spread out geographically during an economic cycle’s later stages, economists say, raising questions about how these cities will fare in a downturn. Workers are usually more confident—and employers more lenient—when the economy has been flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Swift said she and her family were effectively living paycheck to paycheck in the Los Angeles area. But living in Boise is 35% less expensive than living in Los Angeles, according to personal-finance website Bankrate.com. She and her husband, who have two children, bought a house in the Boise area after renting in L.A. It is twice as big as their old place, but the monthly payments are half as much as their L.A. rent. There was also enough room for her mother to move in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all love it,” she said. “We have a much higher quality of life here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some regions see remote work as a promising way to lure people who otherwise wouldn’t consider the move. Vermont and the Shoals area of Alabama, among others, have introduced giveaways to draw telecommuters in the last few years. A program in Tulsa, Okla., hands some arriving remote workers $10,000 in cash.  “You’re looking for something new,” says the website for the program, which is sponsored by the George Kaiser Family Foundation. “We’re looking for great people to join the Tulsa community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-you-shirtless-when-remote-video-calls-go-wrong-11565280525?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;remote work has become increasingly important&lt;/a&gt; as migration paths emerge across the country. The biggest U.S. cities are still drawing more people than they are losing, but the rate is slowing, according to Jenny Ying, a data scientist at LinkedIn, the workplace networking website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers are moving from New York City to Charlotte. N.C., and Orlando, Fla., and from Chicago to Nashville, Tenn., and Indianapolis, according to an analysis for The Wall Street Journal by LinkedIn. They are also leaving Los Angeles for Las Vegas, San Francisco for Reno, Nev., and Seattle for Eugene, Ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-crisis-yields-a-generation-of-renters-11564228800?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The livability crises&lt;/a&gt; of certainly the West Coast and some of the East Coast are clearly a push factor,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, some 5.3% of adults in metro areas of between 500,000 and three million people worked from home, a rough proxy for remote workers. That was up from 3.7% a decade earlier, according to an analysis of the latest Census Bureau data that Mr. Muro did for the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of home workers in these metros—which includes Boise on the smaller side and Denver on the larger side—grew faster than in both smaller and larger regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among freelancers, nearly four-fifths choose to do so partly because it allows them to work from a location of their choosing, according to a survey by the freelance marketplace &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/UPWK&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/span&gt; The survey also found that if freelancing keeps increasing in popularity, people are more likely to move out of urban job centers to places that cater to their lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boise, locals say that a lot of the new residents are attracted by the mix of city and small-town amenities as well as the abundant outdoor activities. “We just hit a lot of marks, so we attract a lot of people who have the ability to work anywhere,” said Andrea Pettitt, a Boise real-estate agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each worker who left Boise over the past four years, 1.57 workers moved in, making the city the biggest magnet for new residents in the LinkedIn analysis. New Boise arrivals most often come from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Many have skills tied to strategy, sales, business development and startups, all of which tend to translate well from one place to another. Some own small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim and Matt Lutterloh, who are originally from Seattle, moved to the Boise suburb of Meridian two years ago after a stint in Scottsdale, Ariz. They considered moving back to Seattle, but decided against it because housing had gotten so expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lutterloh works remotely for a litigation-support company and Mrs. Lutterloh works as a physical therapist, which made it easy for her to find work in a new city. A large share of their neighborhood telecommutes, Mr. Lutterloh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lutterlohs, who plan to stay for the foreseeable future, enjoy the rich culture of the downtown area, which they say has a familiar vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It feels like a little bit of Seattle 15 years ago,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Workers Are Fleeing Big Cities for Small Ones—and Taking Their Jobs With Them</og:title>
<og:description>People who do their jobs from home, freelance or frequently travel for work are fueling a renaissance in American cities that lie outside the major job hubs.</og:description>

<title>From FOMO to JOMO: the joy of missing out</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/jomo</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nesslabs.com/jomo</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to live in a city where lots of stuff happens. There’s always a conference, an exhibition, small meetups. I never really struggle to find something to do. I also spend a lot of time on the Internet, so there are talks, live streams, and chats happening online. And then, of course, there are friends and family. It’s exciting to have all these opportunities to interact with great people, but of course I can’t do it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has happened to all of us. You are invited to a dinner party, maybe drinks, or an event. But you can’t make it. Maybe it’s a deadline at work, maybe a call with a customer, or a kid on holiday who you need to stay with for the day. You can’t help but wonder: what am I missing out on? Are they having lots of fun without me? Are they going to bond over conversations I’m not able to join?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all have come to know it, this is called FOMO, or fear of missing out. It’s especially prevalent among people who spend quite a bit of time online. With the ability to easily see what everyone is doing all the time comes the curse of knowing exactly what we may be missing out on. Associated with a fear of regret, FOMO is the apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which you are absent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term was coined by Patrick J. McGinnis, a venture capitalist and author, who used it for the very first time in an op-ed while studying at Harvard Business School. For many people, FOMO becomes a recurrent concern that they might miss an opportunity for a novel experience, a social interaction, a profitable investment, or other satisfying things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150626125816/http://www.jwtintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/F_JWT_FOMO-update_3.21.12.pdf&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in the US and the UK found that the majority of young adults—between the ages of 18 and 34—want to say yes to everything because of their FOMO, and many feel like they don’t invest enough energy or time in exploring new topics or interests due to it. The good news is that there is an alternative to FOMO. But first, let’s try to understand its root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fomo-jomo-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;FOMO to JOMO: Joy of Missing Out&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What causes your fear of missing out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000800?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that FOMO is, at its core, caused by a low life satisfaction, with low moods and the feeling that your needs aren’t met, there are some specific factors that have a direct impact on your likelihood to experience it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media.&lt;/strong&gt; Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Envy-on-Facebook%3A-A-Hidden-Threat-to-Users'-Life-Krasnova-Wenninger/b775840d43f9f93b7a9031449f809c388f342291&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that there is a high correlation between a person’s usage of social media and FOMO. Social media allows people to see all the fun things their friends have done throughout the last day, causing FOMO to set in. The fear is exacerbated by the fact that people tend to share a more polished version of their lives on social media, often centred on social activities and fun experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nesslabs.com/loneliness-solitude&quot;&gt;benefits of being alone&lt;/a&gt; before. But the main difference between loneliness and solitude is that the latter is a conscious decision. Solitude can be beneficial. Loneliness, on the other hand, is associated with a bunch of negative effects, such as depression, suicide, and even cardiovascular disease. And it’s not hard to understand why loneliness is linked with FOMO: being alone hurts more when you don’t want to be alone, and where people you know seem to be enjoying themselves together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563202000146?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the escalating amount of real-time information and transparency of other people’s social lives make things even worse when it comes to loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt; This state of inner turmoil, which often comes with nervous behaviour, is also an underlying cause of FOMO. To make things worse, social media is often used as a coping strategy by people who suffer from anxiety, with the idea that mindless scrolling is a good way to relax the mind. But it actually has the opposite effect. Researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401217310629?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; a vicious circle of anxiety – social media use – FOMO – anxiety where people can get stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOMO was added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/fomo&quot;&gt;Oxford Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and defined as the “anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on social media.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that this anxiety may prevent you from doing things you would actually enjoy doing, just because others may currently be having fun without you. When you give into FOMO, you become addicted to the knowing, the instant gratification of the likes and the short-term attention, the meaningless busyness, and you keep going back for more. You may even end up joining people for activities you don’t actually care about, just for fear of missing out. Ultimately, it’s your life you’re missing out on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fomo-jomo-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;FOMO to JOMO: Joy of Missing Out&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The art of doing less&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of yielding to the social pressure to be at the right place with the right people, and comparing our lives to others, we should practice tuning out the background noise and becoming intentional with our time. Freeing up that anxious and competitive space in your brain gives you more time and energy to tackle your true priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other people spend their time running around to watch the latest movie, try the latest workout, or attend the latest exhibition, embracing JOMO—the joy of missing out—means relishing to stay in, enjoying your own company, and getting to work on your own projects. In a hyperactive world of choices and information, the pared-back approach to life can help you achieve more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZYxf9L&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; The Joy of Missing Out, Danish psychology professor Svend Brinkmann urges us to go back to the old fashioned ideas of restraint and moderation. “Opting out and saying no”, he writes, are skills we lack “both as individuals and as a society.” By practicing these skills, cultivating self-restraint, and celebrating moderation, we can develop a more fulfilling way of living that enriches ourselves as well as our fellow humans, and with the added bonus of protecting the planet we all share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, JOMO is a way to live an intentional life. It’s realising that FOMO is distracting you from your life’s purpose, and that you don’t need more time. You just need to use your time in a way that allows you to act on intent-based ideas, such as creative projects or spending time with the people you care about the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
“Oh the joy of missing out. 
When the world begins to shout
And rush towards that shining thing;
The latest bit of mental bling–
Trying to have it, see it, do it,
You simply know you won't go through it;
The anxious clamoring and need
This restless hungry thing to feed.
Instead, you feel the loveliness;
The pleasure of your emptiness.
You spurn the treasure on the shelf
In favor of your peaceful self;
Without regret, without a doubt.
Oh the joy of missing out”
&lt;strong&gt;— Michael Leunig, Poet and Cultural Commentator.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to embrace the joy of missing out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living life in the slow lane is hard when everyone is running around. It also means spending more time alone with our thoughts, which can be terrifying at first. But JOMO can help us be who we really are, instead of acting based on external pressures that may give us short-term satisfaction but long-term regrets. Here are a few ways to bring more JOMO into your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect.&lt;/strong&gt; Review how you currently spend your time. Which activities are driven by others, as opposed to being intentional? Journaling is a great way to get clarity and ensure that you spend your time on things that makes sense to you based on your long-term priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect.&lt;/strong&gt; Embrace offline time. As we discussed earlier, social media is one of the leading causes of FOMO. Take the time to turn off your phone and spend time alone with your thoughts. Read a book, go for a walk, work out, whatever makes you feel good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnect.&lt;/strong&gt; Both with yourself and with the people you care about. Make your time your priority. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nesslabs.com/time-management&quot;&gt;Schedule&lt;/a&gt; the things that matter to you the most so you can make sure they happen, whatever the external commitments you may have. Spending time in a meaningful way will help you stop worrying about how others spend their time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on their deathbed don’t regret missing these work drinks or not going to that party. They regret not spending enough time with their families, not working hard enough to achieve their life purpose, or not being true to themselves. Instead of filling your mind with regrets, strive to fill it with good memories and proud achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

       &lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI—India may have failed at its attempt to land a probe on the moon, losing communication with the lunar lander just as it was about to touch down.&lt;/p&gt; 




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Millions in the country of more than 1.3 billion people watched in the wee hours of India’s Saturday morning as the Chandrayaan-2 moon mission hurtled toward its destination. Minutes away from the scheduled landing, the screen at the Indian Space Research Organization’s monitoring center in the southern city of Bangalore showed the lander diverging from its expected path.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After more than 20 tense minutes during which the leaders of India’s space program looked confused, and huddled in groups apparently discussing what was happening, ISRO chairman 




      K. Sivan




       made a simple announcement: The lander got to around 2.1 kilometers (about 1.3 miles) from its destination, then stopped sending signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The communication from lander to ground station was lost,” he said. “The data is being analyzed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister 




      Narendra Modi




       was also at the space center, monitoring the mission’s progress. “What you have done is not a small achievement,” he told the scientists after the loss of communications was announced. “Our journey will continue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Russia, the U.S. and China, India is trying to become the fourth country to land an unmanned craft on the moon. The lander had a small lunar rover in its belly. It was scheduled to move around and analyze the nearby terrain and minerals for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities offered no further details and asked the journalists gathered in the monitoring center in Bangalore to go home. A scheduled news conference was canceled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts and other space enthusiasts on Indian television news shows tried to put a positive spin on the development. Some said they hoped communication could be restored and the mission completed, but even if that didn’t happen India should be proud at how close it got. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Landing on the moon has proven to be tricky, said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, the head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Since there was a deviation from the planned trajectory, the central engine could have malfunctioned. The other thing could be that the data transmission link got lost,” she said. “It could just be the communication link getting snapped but things being normal. It’s still difficult to say with certainty what could have gone wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Landing on the moon is particularly difficult because it has almost no atmosphere. That means parachutes can’t be used, so landers depend on thrusters to set them down at the proper speed and in the right place. Transmissions to and from Earth take more than a second, so the lander cannot be controlled in real time. The Indian lander was programmed to scan for a suitable spot to land and reach it automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A similar Israeli mission failed earlier this year at around the same stage. As it descended to the lunar surface, it lost communications and hit the moon at too high a speed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are challenging matters and it could happen even to more experienced countries,” said Ram S. Jakhu, former director of the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University in Montreal. “Knowing something in theory and doing it in practice is different.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India was hoping its arrival on its surface would highlight its high-tech chops as interest in space is growing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology has made it cheaper and easier to attempt to explore and potentially make money away from Earth. China has announced grand plans to do more in space, and the U.S. is trying to keep its lead. The private sector also has a number of initiatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China landed a rover on the far side of the moon in January and next year, it plans to send one to Mars. It is even planning a lunar base and a space station above Earth. Japan hopes to land its first probe on the moon in 2021. Meanwhile, the U.S. wants to build a space station orbiting the moon by 2023, make a manned moon landing the same year and even land a person on Mars by 2033.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;India targeted the moon’s south pole because it would have been a first for any country and there is evidence that it has water. If the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and rover could confirm the location of pockets of water—scientists say it is likely within craters—it would be useful for future missions. The ice could be turned into hydrogen for fuel and oxygen to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if the lander is lost, India should be able to continue to survey the moon’s surface with the orbiter. That would provide more clues not only about what happened to the lander but also for the future of space travel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We remain hopeful and will continue working hard on our space programme,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1170080152895643648?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Modi said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleTagLine&quot;&gt;—Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Bellman at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eric.bellman@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;eric.bellman@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Wikipedia was hit with a malicious attack that has taken it offline in several countries for intermittent periods. The attack is ongoing and our Site Reliability Engineering team is working hard to stop it and restore access to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the world’s most popular sites, Wikipedia sometimes attracts “bad faith” actors. Along with the rest of the web, we operate in an increasingly sophisticated and complex environment where threats are continuously evolving. Because of this, the Wikimedia communities and Wikimedia Foundation have created dedicated systems and staff to regularly monitor and address risks. If a problem occurs, we learn, we improve, and we prepare to be better for next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We condemn these sorts of attacks. They’re not just about taking Wikipedia offline. Takedown attacks threaten everyone’s fundamental rights to freely access and share information. We in the Wikimedia movement and Foundation are committed to protecting these rights for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re continuing to work to restore access wherever you might be reading Wikipedia in the world. We’ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>M.I.T. Media Lab concealed its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-an-elite-university-research-center-concealed-its-relationship-with-jeffrey-epstein</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;22.931174089069&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Update: On Saturday, less than a day after the publication of this story, Joi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, resigned from his position. “After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,” Ito wrote in an internal e-mail. In &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/fact-finding-and-action-media-lab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a message to the M.I.T. community&lt;/a&gt;, L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., wrote, “Because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,” and announced that M.I.T.’s general counsel would engage an outside law firm to oversee that investigation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;290.02711081393&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M.I.T. Media Lab, which has been embroiled in a scandal over accepting donations from the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, had a deeper fund-raising relationship with Epstein than it has previously acknowledged, and it attempted to conceal the extent of its contacts with him. Dozens of pages of e-mails and other documents obtained by &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; reveal that, although Epstein was listed as “disqualified” in M.I.T.’s official donor database, the Media Lab continued to accept gifts from him, consulted him about the use of the funds, and, by marking his contributions as anonymous, avoided disclosing their full extent, both publicly and within the university. Perhaps most notably, Epstein appeared to serve as an intermediary between the lab and other wealthy donors, soliciting millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations, including the technologist and philanthropist Bill Gates and the investor Leon Black. According to the records obtained by &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and accounts from current and former faculty and staff of the media lab, Epstein was credited with securing at least $7.5 million in donations for the lab, including two million dollars from Gates and $5.5 million from Black, gifts the e-mails describe as “directed” by Epstein or made at his behest. The effort to conceal the lab’s contact with Epstein was so widely known that some staff in the office of the lab’s director, Joi Ito, referred to Epstein as Voldemort or “he who must not be named.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial entanglement revealed in the documents goes well beyond what has been described in public statements by M.I.T. and by Ito. The University has said that it received eight hundred thousand dollars from Epstein’s foundations, in the course of twenty years, and has apologized for accepting that amount. In a statement last month, M.I.T.’s president, L. Rafael Reif, wrote, “with hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that.” Reif pledged to donate the funds to a charity to help victims of sexual abuse. On Wednesday, Ito disclosed that he had separately received $1.2 million from Epstein for investment funds under his control, in addition to five hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars that he acknowledged Epstein had donated to the lab. A spokesperson for M.I.T. said that the university “is looking at the facts surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s gifts to the institute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents and sources suggest that there was more to the story. They show that the lab was aware of Epstein’s history—in 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution—and of his disqualified status as a donor. They also show that Ito and other lab employees took numerous steps to keep Epstein’s name from being associated with the donations he made or solicited. On Ito’s calendar, which typically listed the full names of participants in meetings, Epstein was identified only by his initials. Epstein’s direct contributions to the lab were recorded as anonymous. In September, 2014, Ito wrote to Epstein soliciting a cash infusion to fund a certain researcher, asking, “Could you re-up/top-off with another $100K so we can extend his contract another year?” Epstein replied, “yes.” Forwarding the response to a member of his staff, Ito wrote, “Make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.” Peter Cohen, the M.I.T. Media Lab’s Director of Development and Strategy at the time, reiterated, “Jeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein’s apparent role in directing outside contributions was also elided. In October, 2014, the Media Lab received a two-million-dollar donation from Bill Gates; Ito wrote in an internal e-mail, “This is a $2M gift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein.” Cohen replied, “For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey’s name as the impetus for this gift.” A mandatory record of the gift filed within the university stated only that “Gates is making this gift at the recommendation of a friend of his who wishes to remain anonymous.” Knowledge of Epstein’s alleged role was usually kept within a tight circle. In response to the university filing, Cohen wrote to colleagues, “I did not realize that this would be sent to dozens of people,” adding that Epstein “is not named but questions could be asked” and that “I feel uncomfortable that this was distributed so widely.” He wrote that future filings related to Epstein should be submitted only “if there is a way to do it quietly.” An agent for Gates wrote to the leadership of the Media Lab, stating that Gates also wished to keep his name out of any public discussion of the donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Gates said that “any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.” A source close to Gates said that the entrepreneur has a long-standing relationship with the lab, and that anonymous donations from him or his foundation are not atypical. Gates has previously denied receiving financial advisory services from Epstein; in August, CNBC reported that he met with Epstein in New York in 2013, to discuss “ways to increase philanthropic spending.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joi Ito and Peter Cohen did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Ito, in his public statements, has downplayed his closeness with Epstein, stating that “Regrettably, over the years, the Lab has received money through some of the foundations that he controlled,” and acknowledging only that he “knew about” gifts and personally gave permission. But the e-mails show that Ito consulted closely with Epstein and actively sought the various donations. At one point, Cohen reached out to Ito for advice about a donor, writing, “you or Jeffrey would know best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epstein, who socialized with a range of high-profile and influential people, had for years been followed by claims that he sexually abused underage girls. Police investigated the reports several times. In 2008, after a Florida grand jury charged Epstein with soliciting prostitution, he received a controversial plea deal, which shielded him from federal prosecution and allowed him to serve less than thirteen months, and much of it on a “work release,” permitting him to spend much of his time out of jail. Alexander Acosta, the prosecutor responsible for that plea deal, went on to become President Trump’s Secretary of Labor, but resigned from that post in July, amid widespread criticism related to the Epstein case. That same month, Esptein was arrested in New York, on federal sex-trafficking charges. He died from suicide, in a jail cell in Manhattan, last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current and former faculty and staff of the media lab described a pattern of concealing Epstein’s involvement with the institution. Signe Swenson, a former development associate and alumni coordinator at the lab, told me that she resigned in 2016 in part because of her discomfort about the lab’s work with Epstein. She said that the lab’s leadership made it explicit, even in her earliest conversations with them, that Epstein’s donations had to be kept secret. In early 2014, while Swenson was working in M.I.T.’s central fund-raising office, as a development associate, she had breakfast with Cohen, the Director of Development and Strategy. They discussed her application for a fund-raising role at the Media Lab. According to Swenson, Cohen explained to her that the lab was currently working with Epstein and that it was seeking to do more with the financier. “He said Joi has been working with Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein’s connecting us to other people,” Swenson recalled. She assumed that Cohen raised the matter “to test whether I would be confidential and sort of feel out whether I would be O.K. with the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swenson had seen that Epstein was listed in the university’s central donor database as disqualified. “I knew he was a pedophile and pointed that out,” she said. She recalled telling Cohen that working with Epstein “doesn’t seem like a great idea.” But she respected the lab’s work and ultimately accepted a job with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That spring, during her first week in her new role, the issue arose again. Swenson recalled having a conversation with Cohen and Ito about how to take money from Epstein without reporting it within the university. Cohen asked, “How do we do this?” Swenson replied that, due to the university’s internal-reporting requirements, there was no way to keep the donations under the radar. Ito, as Swenson recalled, replied, “we can take small gifts anonymously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of 2014 and 2015, according to the e-mails and sources, Ito and Epstein also developed an ambitious plan to secure a large new influx of contributions from Epstein’s contacts, including Gates, without disclosing the full extent of the financier’s involvement to M.I.T.’s central fund-raising office. The e-mails show that Epstein was the point person for communication with the donors, including Gates and Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s largest private-equity firms. In one message to Ito, Epstein wrote, “Gates would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week.” In an e-mail from Cohen to Ito, asking whether Black wished his contributions to remain anonymous, Cohen wrote, “Can you ask Jeffrey to ask Leon that?” He added, “We can make it anonymous easily, unless Leon would like the credit. If Jeffrey tells you that Leon would like a little love from MIT, we can arrange that too. . . .”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black declined to comment. A source close to him said that he did not intend for the donation to be anonymous. Black has &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-apollo.html%5D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;downplayed&lt;/a&gt; his relationship with Epstein in recent months, describing it as limited and focussed on tax strategy, estate planning, and philanthropic advice. He has declined to answer questions about business dealings with Epstein that suggest a closer relationship. Several years after Epstein’s conviction, Black and his children and Epstein jointly invested in a company that makes emission-control products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the lab ultimately secured the $7.5 million from Gates and Black, Epstein and Ito’s fund-raising plan failed to reach the still larger scale that they had initially hoped. Epstein had suggested that he could insure that any donations he solicited, including those from Gates and Black, would be matched by the John Templeton Foundation, which funds projects at the intersection of faith and science. Ultimately, the Foundation did not provide funding and a spokesperson said that the organization has no records related to any such plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015, as the Media Lab determined how to spend the funds it had received with Epstein’s help, Cohen informed lab staff that Epstein would be coming for a visit. The financier would meet with faculty members, apparently to allow him to give input on projects and to entice him to contribute further. Swenson, the former development associate and alumni coördinator, recalled saying, referring to Epstein, “I don’t think he should be on campus.” She told me, “At that point it hit me: this pedophile is going to be in our office.” According to Swenson, Cohen agreed that Epstein was “unsavory” but said “we’re planning to do it anyway—this was Joi’s project.” Staffers entered the meeting into Ito’s calendar without including Epstein’s name. They also tried to keep his name out of e-mail communication. “There was definitely an explicit conversation about keeping it off the books, because Joi’s calendar is visible to everyone,” Swenson said. “It was just marked as a V.I.P. visit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, several faculty and staff members had objected to the university’s relationship with Epstein. Ethan Zuckerman, an associate professor, had voiced concerns about the relationship with Epstein for years. In 2013, Zuckerman said, he pulled Ito aside after a faculty meeting to express concern about meetings on Ito’s calendar marked “J.E.” Zuckerman recalled saying, “I heard you’re meeting with Epstein. I don’t think that’s a good idea,” and Ito responding, “You know, he’s really fascinating. Would you like to meet him?” Zuckerman declined and said that he believed the relationship could have negative consequences for the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, as Epstein’s visit drew near, Cohen instructed his staff to insure that Zuckerman, if he unexpectedly arrived while Epstein was present, be kept away from the glass-walled office in which Epstein would be conducting meetings. According to Swenson, Ito had informed Cohen that Epstein “never goes into any room without his two female ‘assistants,’ ” whom he wanted to bring to the meeting at the Media Lab. Swenson objected to this, too, and it was decided that the assistants would be allowed to accompany Epstein but would wait outside the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the visit, Swenson’s distress deepened at the sight of the young women. “They were models. Eastern European, definitely,” she told me. Among the lab’s staff, she said, “all of us women made it a point to be super nice to them. We literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they’re not there by choice, we could maybe help them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swenson and several other former and current M.I.T. Media Lab employees expressed discomfort over the lab’s recent statements about its relationship with Epstein. In August, two researchers, including Zuckerman, resigned in protest over the matter. In a &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@EthanZ/on-me-and-the-media-lab-715bfc707f6f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the decision, Zuckerman wrote that M.I.T. had “violated its own values so clearly in working with Epstein and in disguising that relationship.” Zuckerman began providing counsel to other colleagues who also objected. He directed Swenson to seek representation from the legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, and she began the process of going public. “Jeffrey Epstein shows that—with enough money—a convicted sex offender can open doors at the highest level of philanthropy,” John Tye, Swenson’s attorney at Whistleblower Aid, told me. “Joi Ito and his development chief went out of their way to keep Epstein’s role under wraps. When institutions try to hide the truth, it often takes a brave whistle-blower to step forward. But it can be dangerous, and whistle-blowers need support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions about when to accept money from wealthy figures accused of misconduct have always been fraught. Before his conviction, Epstein donated to numerous philanthropic, academic, and political institutions, which responded in a variety of ways to the claims of abuse. When news of the allegations first broke, in 2006, a Harvard spokesperson said that the university, which had received a 6.5-million-dollar donation from him three years earlier, would not be returning the money. Following Epstein’s second arrest, in 2019, the university reiterated its stance. Many institutions attempted to distance themselves from Epstein after 2006, but others, including the M.I.T. Media Lab, continued to accept his money. When such donations come to light, institutions face difficult decisions about how to respond. The funds have often already been spent, and the tax deductions already taken by donors. But the revelations about Epstein’s widespread sexual misconduct, most notably reported by &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Julie K. Brown in the Miami &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have made clear that Epstein used the status and prestige afforded him by his relationships with élite institutions to shield himself from accountability and continue his alleged predation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swenson said that, even though she resigned over the lab’s relationship with Epstein, her participation in what she took to be a coverup of his contributions has weighed heavily on her since. Her feelings of guilt were revived when she learned of recent statements from Ito and M.I.T. leadership that she believed to be lies. “I was a participant in covering up for Epstein in 2014,” she told me. “Listening to what comments are coming out of the lab or M.I.T. about the relationship—I just see exactly the same thing happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title> Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt makes certs for 30% of web domains</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leebutterman.com/2019/08/01/handshaking-the-web-dataset-of-350-million-ssl-connections.html&quot;&gt;dataset of 350 million ssl connections&lt;/a&gt; inspires some initial questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;who made the certs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what crypto powers it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what sort of life time&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leebutterman.com/&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; you’re reading this on uses automated certs from Let’s Encrypt—they are more common on a domain than any other registrar! Over 47 million domains are protected with Let’s Encrypt certs, almost 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 352.3M domains, the dataset has 158.7M connections that proceeded far enough to provide a certificate with an issuer’s Distinguished Name. The top dozen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:issuer_dn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leebutterman.com/2019/08/05/analyzing-hundreds-of-millions-of-ssl-connections.html#fn:issuer_dn&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;115&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unknown&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the latest Chrome cannot load &lt;a href=&quot;https://rc4.badssl.com/&quot;&gt;RC4&lt;/a&gt; but it does load &lt;a href=&quot;https://3des.badssl.com/&quot;&gt;3DES&lt;/a&gt;. (Thanks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;badssl.com&lt;/code&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;over-4-million-domains-are-using-outdated-tls&quot;&gt;Over 4 million domains are using outdated TLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;’s TLS package doesn’t use TLS 1.3, and it seems like the dataset was run with a zgrab that doesn’t use TLS 1.3 (perhaps this is worth updating for the next run). Most domains’ servers were using TLS 1.2, the next latest, but over 4 million were using TLS 1.0.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:tls_version&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leebutterman.com/2019/08/05/analyzing-hundreds-of-millions-of-ssl-connections.html#fn:tls_version&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;154500876&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLSv1.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4263887&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLSv1.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;19352&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TLSv1.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1781&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SSLv3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tls-v1-0.badssl.com:1010/&quot;&gt;TLS 1.0&lt;/a&gt; is still allowed in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hundreds-of-thousands-of-domains-certs-expire-after-2099&quot;&gt;Hundreds of thousands of domains’ certs expire after 2099&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html&quot;&gt;Current SSL cert lifetime best practices&lt;/a&gt; put lifetimes at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But best practices do not forbid &lt;em&gt;alternative practices!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.leebutterman.com/assets/bristlecone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt; Certs are in the wild with millenium-scale lifetimes, like these bristlecone pines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Rick Goldwaser from Flagstaff, AZ, USA [&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0&quot;&gt;CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;], &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gnarly_Bristlecone_Pine.jpg&quot;&gt;via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;thousands-of-certs-served-expire-after-the-year-3000&quot;&gt;Thousands of certs served expire after the year 3000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 3K certs served don’t expire this millenium. Over 8K certs expire after 2200. Over 200K certs expire after 2100. (Over 1.5M expire in the 2040s alone!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a hundred thousand certs alone expire in 2117, and over a thousand expire in 3017. Perhaps something in 2017 inspired confidence in long-lived certs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;millions-of-certs-served-have-expired&quot;&gt;Millions of certs served have expired&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 1.6M domains had a cert that had recently expired (in July, the month of the scan). Almost 3.7M domains had a cert that expired in 2019 (the year of the scan). Over 9.6M domains had a cert that expired in the 2010s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hundreds-of-certs-served-are-not-yet-valid&quot;&gt;Hundreds of certs served are not yet valid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, over a hundred thousand certs expire before their validity date!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-this-at-home&quot;&gt;Try this at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think! Analyze this dataset and share your new findings!&lt;/p&gt;
