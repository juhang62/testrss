<title>When a Bike Company Put a TV on Its Box, Shipping Damages Went Down (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20027122/vanmoof-tv-on-box-damaged-bikes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20027122/vanmoof-tv-on-box-damaged-bikes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Sometimes, to make a product truly great, a company must think outside the box. But for Dutch bike manufacturer VanMoof, thinking about the box itself solved a major problem when it came to shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a class=&quot;body-link&quot; href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/smallbusiness/vanmoof-bike-box-tv/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-vars-ga-outbound-link=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/smallbusiness/vanmoof-bike-box-tv/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, the company reported that more than 25 percent of its bikes were damaged before even being delivered last year. The problem was especially bad when shipping to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;&quot;Your covetable products, your frictionless website, your killer brand — they all count for nothing when your delivery partner drops the ball,&quot; Bex Rad, Vanmoof's creative director, wrote in a Medium post last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a class=&quot;body-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bicycling.com/news/strava-premium-updates/&quot; data-vars-ga-outbound-link=&quot;https://www.bicycling.com/news/strava-premium-updates/&quot;&gt;Strava Will Now Reimburse You for Phone Damage and a Taxi Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;The solution? Reconsider the packaging. &quot;We asked ourselves, what do Americans really love? What would prompt couriers to be delicate with a parcel?&quot; VanMoof co-founder Taco Carlier told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;A TV was the obvious answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;A big-screen TV box is roughly the same size and weight as a bike box. So to convince shippers to handle its products with more care, VanMoof began printing photos of TVs on its packaging. The boxes still depicted the bike, too, but at a glance it does look like you would find a massive widescreen TV inside instead of a high-end &lt;a class=&quot;body-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/reviews/16-for-2016-the-years-best-city-and-commuter-bikes/&quot; data-vars-ga-outbound-link=&quot;https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/reviews/16-for-2016-the-years-best-city-and-commuter-bikes/&quot;&gt;commuter bike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text&quot;&gt;Damages dropped by 80 percent since then, according to the company. Even after a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter spilled the beans by tweeting about the deception last year, the drop in damages has reportedly stayed consistent.

(GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota)
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/china-option-fades-bill-gates-urges-u-s-take-lead-nuclear-power-good-planet/&quot;&gt;year-end letter last month&lt;/a&gt; that he planned to work to persuade U.S. leaders to embrace advanced nuclear technologies as a solution to curbing climate change. That work appears to have begun as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/bill-gates-comes-to-washington--selling-the-promise-of-nuclear-energy/2019/01/25/4bd9c030-1445-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html?utm_term=.b3903fced86b&quot;&gt;The Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday that Gates is making the rounds on Capitol Hill looking for support — and billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates founded the Bellevue, Wash.-based TerraPower in 2006, and the venture had been working toward building a pilot project for its traveling-wave nuclear technology in China. Policy regulations put in place by the Trump administration have made that unlikely and Gates is hoping to make his grand plan happen in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post reported, based on accounts from congressional staffers, that the Microsoft co-founder is telling lawmakers that he personally would invest $1 billion and raise $1 billion more in private capital to go along with federal funds for TerraPower’s pilot plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates has reportedly met with lawmakers from both parties, including Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). He also met with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and three other senators last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah Goldman, of Gates Ventures, stressed to The Post that Gates was not advocating for TerraPower alone. Gates thinks the U.S. has “the best minds, the best lab systems and entrepreneurs willing to take risk,” Goldman told the newspaper. “But what we don’t have is a commitment on Congress’ part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The world needs energy breakthroughs that improve people’s lives without contributing to climate change. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IEA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@IEA&lt;/a&gt; highlights in its latest report, governments have an incredible opportunity to shape the future of energy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YCPep4ytgn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/YCPep4ytgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Memory usage of a toy C# server and client with 500K concurrent connections on</title>
<link>https://github.com/kjpgit/techdemo/blob/master/dotnet_client_server/README.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/kjpgit/techdemo/blob/master/dotnet_client_server/README.md</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kjpgit/techdemo/blob/master/dotnet_task_memory_usage&quot;&gt;last episode&lt;/a&gt;, we measured the memory overhead of the simplest possible .NET Core task / coroutine. Now let's step it up and make a network server that echoes back bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code for the client and server is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kjpgit/techdemo/blob/master/dotnet_client_server/Program.cs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the standard .NET Core networking library, nothing fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core 2.2.102 on Ubuntu 18.04 (&lt;code&gt;dotnet --version&lt;/code&gt;). Memory information from &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default threadpool settings, which appear to use 10-12 actual threads for the client, on my dual core Pentium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix stream sockets to make it simple (TCP is just annoying, even on loopback)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server baseline (1 client): 79 MB RSS / 3260 MB VSS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server loaded (500000 persistent client connections, sending requests every 30 seconds): 1000-1300 MB RSS / 4430 MB VSS (RSS fluctuates due to GC) (&lt;code&gt;dotnet run -c Release -- client 500000 30&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta: 1000-1200 MB RSS, 1200 MB VSS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per client overhead (C# server process only, not including kernel): &lt;strong&gt;2000-2400 bytes RSS, 2400 bytes VSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the client process has a very similar memory usage profile as the server process. They both end up settling at 1GB RSS after a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, very impressive! This is only about 2x of what the toy coroutine allocated. It's likely that the memory overhead of the language / runtime is going to be small compared to your application-specific data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously C/C++/Rust with handwritten state machines could make this way smaller, e.g. under 100 bytes. But at some point there are diminishing returns, and also developer productivity, bugs, and security are big tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the exceptions thrown by the runtime when I was up against max file descriptor limits. &quot;Errors must not pass silently&quot; - I'm glad C# agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate that everything &quot;just worked&quot; with 500K Unix sockets. I was expecting something in the runtime (e.g. epoll) to break. .NET just keeps surprising me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Testing Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When testing, note that &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/statm&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;4K pages&lt;/em&gt;, unlike &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;swapoff -a&lt;/code&gt; so swap isn't hiding memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase file descriptors in a GUI session: Set in &lt;code&gt;DefaultLimitNOFILE=2000000&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system.conf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/user.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Then reboot (yes, reboot). Also update &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/file-max&lt;/code&gt; to 3000000. Alternatively, just spawn some shells via root...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<title>We value your privacy now, but maybe not later</title>
<link>https://raimue.blog/2019/01/26/we-value-your-privacy-now-but-maybe-not-later/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://raimue.blog/2019/01/26/we-value-your-privacy-now-but-maybe-not-later/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows these modal dialogs when visiting a website for the first time that ask you to accept cookies and consent to being tracked by third-party advertising networks. It actually became a habit for me to always click through these things and reject any kind of tracking or use of my personal information except for the “required” cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, I came across this dialog on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/&quot;&gt;atlasobscura.com&lt;/a&gt; with the title &lt;em&gt;We value your privacy&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15-1024x708.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1235&quot; srcset=&quot;https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15-1024x708.png 1024w, https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15-300x208.png 300w, https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15-768x531.png 768w, https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15-624x432.png 624w, https://raimue.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-26-at-17.22.15.png 1194w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly doubt Atlas Obscura actually values my privacy when the only option is to “accept”. By the way, if you actually follow to the privacy policy to “withdraw consent”, access to the content is still blocked by this modal dialog on the next visit. Leaving technical details aside, for the layperson there is in fact no other choice than clicking “accept”, if they want to get access to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you actually read their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/privacy&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; in detail, it contains this one phrase that really stired up my blood even more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas Obscura may, at its sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. By accessing the Website at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to such modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can such a privacy policy be legal? They claim to value my privacy and I can review what they mean by that in the policy. However, at the same time they do not commit to keep it like that and might not “value my privacy” at any later point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think this further. If this clause is in fact legal, we could set up a website with a volatile privacy policy. That would be a privacy policy that changes on every visit of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, on the first visit, we happily tell the visitor that we do not collect any information, do not use personal information, and of course also do not sell any kinds of data to adverstising networks. However, as soon as the visitor accepted this policy (of course they are privacy aware and read the policy), it will suddenly change to the opposite. The visitor will never be informed or even asked for consent again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you agree to a contract that can be changed by the other party at any time in any way? You get the idea. Of course, actually implementing a privacy policy changing unexpectedly would include malice, so the visitor might have a case against it, but only if they ever notice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just took Atlas Obscura as an example of such a policy and I do not mean to only blame this website in particular. There are in fact a lot of other sites on the web that apply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22may%2C%20at%20its%20sole%20discretion%2C%20modify%20this%20Privacy%20Policy%20at%20any%20time.%22&quot;&gt;the same or a similar privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your privacy policy contains a clause that allows you to change the policy without asking me for consent, you do not actually value my privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve hated enterprise sales since long before I started Puppet. I just didn’t know why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-194&quot; src=&quot;https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-25-19-9-52-AM.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;5472&quot; height=&quot;3648&quot; srcset=&quot;https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-25-19-9-52-AM.jpeg 5472w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-25-19-9-52-AM-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-25-19-9-52-AM-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://lukekanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-25-19-9-52-AM-1024x683.jpeg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either be a good example or a horrible warning. When it comes to enterprise sales, I had two horrible warnings before I started Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, I worked at Bluestar, a business DSL startup in Nashville. Pretty much everything that can go wrong with a startup did with this one: Founder was pushed out the week I started (I swear it wasn’t my fault), they raised too much money ($450m) and then spent it badly (e.g., on hardware that didn’t work and on salespeople that didn’t sell), they brought in a big business CEO who had no idea how to run a growth company, and then the regulatory framework shifted to highly advantage monopolies again so they all went broke. But in the meantime, I got to learn a lot, both about the problems that eventually resulted in my starting Puppet, and also about what does and doesn’t work in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the company decided to buy a new product. I honestly can’t remember what it was for. Something related to asset tracking? Or maybe some kind of operational monitoring software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I just know I shifted from being a sysadmin to responsible for making it work. I wasn’t part of the team that decided whether to buy something, and if so, which one to buy, I was just designated to put their decisions into action. In the months I worked on it, I don’t think we ever even got it installed anywhere except on a test server, and at some point we just, ah, decided we didn’t need it any more. The project went away, so I returned to my old job. The executive who had made this horrible decision had the gall to say my moving back to my old role was a strike against me, and it would reflect on my tenure at the company. No worries, he was gone the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a software problem. While the company was slowly dying, they had an argument with EMC over a storage array they never should have purchased. A million dollars of hardware sat in a receiving warehouse for almost a year, because we would not accept it, and EMC would not take it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second warning was during my brief stint at Bladelogic. I worked there for less than six months, but I learned a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. Again, mostly what not to do. I was ostensibly a product manager, but in practice they just wanted me to maintain their lab and maybe write some justifications for how their product worked. Certainly they did not want to listen to me. My most memorable experience is being in an all-dev-team meeting when the most senior engineer said something like, “What does it matter what the customer thinks? They already bought the product.” Astoundingly, the CTO did not fire him on the spot, and instead just moved on, ignoring the comment entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear Bladelogic’s business model enabled them to just not care what their customers thought. Only&lt;em&gt;prospects&lt;/em&gt; mattered. Once the deal was closed, meh, they got paid, no biggie. You literally could not upgrade their software without losing all of your data — you know, the stuff you’re using to build and deploy your whole infrastructure — and doing any real work with the system required that you do everything twice, once to deploy and the second time to update. But you’d never discover that unless you actually used the software, which would be long after their salespeople left, so who cares? Not them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can maybe see why I lasted less than six months. It didn’t help that I was commuting between Boston and Nashville, and I’d managed to rent an apartment at the center of a cold vortex in Boston where my roommate collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Grateful-Dead-Red-Unwine-1st-Edition-Bottle-3-Dancing-Skeletons-non-alcoholic-/281599334403&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead grape juice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I started Puppet, I didn’t know much, but I at least had some anti-patterns. I knew we had to care more about our customers successfully using the product than we did about closing the initial deal, and that selling to people who would not use the software was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that’s not quite sufficient to develop an effective sales strategy. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to hire the best sales leader in Oregon, who was not only incredibly skilled and experienced, he was also used to entrepreneurs and found me relatively sane compared to bosses he’d had in the past. Where a bunch of our engineers complained every time I opened my mouth, this guy quietly soldiered on. That made our years-long argument much easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, I didn’t know enough to break down what I wanted and what I didn’t, or how to talk about the individual behaviors, so I just wrapped up everything I hated and called it “enterprise sales”. We weren’t doing that. Ironically, our sales leader agreed with most of my concerns, so it wasn’t a real fight in the normal sense, but there were multiple areas he was convinced we needed to change, and it’s hard to do that when your ignorant CEO just puts up a ward against the evil eye and changes the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of years, he wouldn’t even say the word ‘enterprise’, because I would jump down his throat, proverbially speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few years of building Puppet, I tended to focus on preventing sales from skewing our product plans. I wanted to be sure we built products to be used, not sold, and I didn’t trust myself or the team to be able to tell the difference. I think this was basically right, but today, I would know that you should treat ideas from sales like you treat those from customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always listen to what customers tell you, but never do what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales team has a limited lens into the product world. They are smart and highly educated about your customer, but that doesn’t automatically translate into good solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a general risk at any company with sales teams, but you have an even more pernicious variant with enterprise sales teams: Being confused on who your customer is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you building the product for the person who buys it, or the one who uses it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember back to that product I tried to set up at Bluestar. It was purchased to solve a business problem, and the person who decided to buy it did so based on discussions with sales and, probably, looking very closely at a grid of check marks comparing it to its competitors.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;ffn1&quot; href=&quot;https://lukekanies.com/my-losing-battle-with-enterprise-sales/#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Actually using it was someone else’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was not going to be the user either — I was supposed to be its administrator. Some other team (support or installation, probably) was going to actually use it. So they were even further from the buying decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re selling to the enterprise, getting a deal done requires that you convince the buyer that your product is a winner. That makes them the most important person at the customer. Now, a quality company would also involve users, administrators, and many others in a buying decision, but in the end, buyer decides. Two or three decades ago, these decisions were mostly made on the golf course, so schmoozing was the most important feature. Today, it’s a lot less corrupt, but not a whole lot more functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the other problem in this separation between user and buyer: Enterprise sales is a team sale, not selling to one user. Suddenly you succeed based on your ability to manage the interpersonal relationships of warring sub-teams at your customer, instead of the strengths of your product. I distinctly remember a dinner with tens of customer employees, and there was almost a flashing DMZ between two teams, who had differing opinions on whether our solutions was the right one. Salesperson quality and experience begin to matter more than anything else, because you’re basically managing internal politics to get a deal done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did the focus on our product go? How do we stay focused on building something our users love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t, really. It’s hard to sustain an effective a feedback loop that includes sales if they’re focused more on people and politics than products. Not impossible. But hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a big company, you can begin to navigate this kind of cognitive dissonance — listen to your sales team, but don’t build the products they demand. But in the early days of Puppet, I knew I couldn’t handle it. I am not good at dissonance in general — I’m a bit too fond of the idea that there’s just one truth — but I especially knew my organization could not handle it. We needed to be 100% aligned, and that meant sales needed to be working on the same problems as our product teams. Thus, no enterprise sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got bigger, the other big problem with enterprise sales starts to show up: Wow is it expensive. Lew Cirne of New Relic told me the primary reason he sold Wily when he did is because he needed to $150m just to build out the sales team and it wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing inside sales, you’ve probably got someone who can talk through most of the product, they can talk to ten or more customers a day, and only once in a while will they pull someone in to help get a deal done. Once you go enterprise, you have field reps who might be covering thousands of square miles of territory, so if you’re lucky they’ll do three meetings a day on average, and they need a sales engineer on almost every visit. They pull in an expensive executive for meetings as often as an inside rep would pull in a cheap sales engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can get much bigger deals done this way, but think about the disruption to your organization: Essentially everyone on your leadership team is taking time away from running the business, not to learn from customers but just to make them feel loved enough to write a big check. Your deals start taking nine months to close instead of six weeks, and getting a check signed begins to look more like a challenge level in a video game than a partnership to solve customer problems. And the boss fight of that game is the worst part of enterprise sales: Procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not in the habit of disrespecting roles or teams, and I think procurement is often staffed with experts who play a vital role in their company. But they are generally paid based on how much money they “save” the company. All that discounting that you have to do for enterprise clients? It’s because procurement’s bonus is based on how much of a discount they force you to give. Absolutely everyone knows this is how it works, and that everyone knows this, so it’s just a game. I offer my product for a huge price, you try to force a discount, and then at the end we all compare notes to see how we did relative to market. Neither of us really wants to be too far out of spec; I want to keep my average prices the same, and you just want to be sure you aren’t paying too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because companies compensate procurement based on saving money rather than making good decisions about what to buy, we can sell crappy products at a steep discount but not good products at list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a helluva boss fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s often a miniboss, too: Legal. They just want their pound of flesh, and often this seems more like a puzzle level than a direct fight. I recently saw a deal that had been in legal for a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;. That’s too much puzzle for me. (Incidentally, I worked on that same customer more than 4 years ago. Talk about long sales cycles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you begin to see why I fought against enterprise sales: It encourages you to build the wrong product for the wrong person and then sell it the wrong way at the wrong price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, is it so popular? Or rather, why is it so hard to avoid that despite my best efforts we ended up in an enterprise sales motion, which I then ran away from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first and foremost, if it works it’s incredibly lucrative. For all that Lew Cirne built New Relic in response to his experience at Wily, and pointedly avoided enterprise sales for years, once they went public they went through a dramatic transformation and added it in, because the money was just too appealing. The biggest companies buy the most software, and, well, the biggest companies want to be sold a specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, you just can’t avoid it. That’s a lot of what happened at Puppet: Our products were built to solve problems that big companies have. Heterogeneous environments, every operating system and application known to man, complex networks, and heavy compliance needs. Turns out it’s rare that a company has all these problems but buys large software products like you buy toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first deals at companies did tend to look very consumer-like. But once they wanted to expand to other teams, and especially if they wanted to cover the whole company, the relationship naturally switched to a team sale, where we’re having to work with legal, procurement, executives, and then reps from three or four other teams. Ideally someone inside the org is an advocate for our product, so it’s more facilitation than direct selling, but the problem still stands: This is a clear enterprise sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it works… wow. You start closing $100k deals, then $300k, then $1m, then $10m. This starts to add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all that I’ve said this is hard… it’s actually the easiest way to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s actually hard is having the best product, and only ever winning based on merit. Enterprise sales is the default motion, and in many cases it’s chosen to paper over weaknesses in the product. After all, only the user would actually notice those; in a meeting with the CIO, procurement, legal, and project management, no one’s going to install the product and give it a runout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still super early as an industry in our understanding of how to build a product that doesn’t rely on enterprise sales. For all that Atlassian relies more on sales than it has said, there’s no question that they managed to avoid an enterprise selling motion. I’m hoping the next generations of software companies will learn from them instead of Workday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, hopefully this story of how I fought enterprise sales, and why, will help you make better decisions about how to build your own teams. At the least, maybe I can just be a horrible warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;These feature check lists are bad ideas. Don’t trust them as a user, don’t make them as a product marketer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukekanies.com/my-losing-battle-with-enterprise-sales/#ffn1&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>“Facebook are going to monetize encrypted messaging by consolidating metadata”</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://threader.app/thread/1088914192847917056</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;thread-head&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pic-user d-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://threader.app/@sarahjamielewis&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;post-img-user&quot; class=&quot;users-thread&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1040578228195414016/jlfiC_Gz.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot; id=&quot;thread-post-start&quot;&gt;Facebook are going to monetize encrypted messaging by consolidating metadata analysis of 3 key platforms (Messenger, Whatsapp &amp;amp; Instagram). They will make money by tracking your relationships and social groups. They will make that information easily accessible to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;They will build the largest surveillance system ever conceived and will sell it under the banner of consumer encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;They will say that this delivers on the dream of secure usable communication that balances privacy, security and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;We @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OpenPriv&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;OpenPriv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenPriv&lt;/a&gt; believe that your social connections, friendship groups and patterns of life should not be monetized or sold for profit. We believe that actual privacy and security must protect metadata as well as content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Sex Workers and Queer People are already facing the wrath of Facebook's metadata collection. Facebook already puts them in danger by outing them to people it assumes they know, allow them to be directly targeted, and directly censored, based on assumed associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;When we celebrate Facebook bringing end to end encryption to millions more people we miss the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of all this isn't accessible privacy it's inaccessible surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;We, @&lt;a class=&quot;tweet-url username&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OpenPriv&quot; data-screen-name=&quot;OpenPriv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenPriv&lt;/a&gt;, are building Cwtch, a metadata resistant communication tool, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://openprivacy.ca/blog/2018/06/28/announcing-cwtch/&quot; title=&quot;https://openprivacy.ca/blog/2018/06/28/announcing-cwtch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;openprivacy.ca/blog/2018/06/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;8/announcing-cwtch/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) as a non-profit because we *know* that you can't protect the most marginalized people in society AND also make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be releasing an alpha of Cwtch on February 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Facebook is not a secure space for sex workers and queer people. What happens when the current content policies and moderation capabilities are extended and augmented by metadata analysis from private chat apps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;What happens when Facebook is forced by a conservative government to hand over group relationships of groups it has categorized as &quot;interested in sex work&quot; all wrapped up with a Facebook augmented social graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;What kind of world do you think we are actually building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;This isn't a conspiracy theory. This is just how the world works today extrapolated into the future - with optimism that things don't get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: Things are going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;The truth is that there are way worse scenarios to confront if we assume that 1 corporation is going to own and operate the largest, encrypted communication network ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;A few months ago I wrote a position paper for a conference on the future of cybersecurity and the same points apply to this. We need surveillance resistant tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openprivacy.ca/assets/open-privacy-position-paper-ccd-2018.pdf&quot; title=&quot;https://openprivacy.ca/assets/open-privacy-position-paper-ccd-2018.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;openprivacy.ca/assets/open-pr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ivacy-position-paper-ccd-2018.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;Facebook isn't a public utility, they are a corporation that needs to make money, and the way they make money is through surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get to decided if you want to be part of their economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;To undercut myself a little - the vast majority of you likely have nothing to lose by being part of the economy. For many it will likely be much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us who experience systemic oppression, those of us who know the harms of surveillance, can see what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;With the exception of the particular NYTimes article that confirmed some of these future Facebook plans, nothing I have said in this thread is new, the risks aren't new, the concerns aren't new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thread isn't a warning, it is a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Are Young People Pretending to Love Work?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Never once at the start of my workweek — not in my morning coffee shop line; not in my crowded subway commute; not as I begin my bottomless inbox slog — have I paused, looked to the heavens and whispered: #ThankGodIt’sMonday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apparently, that makes me a traitor to my generation. I learned this during a series of recent visits to WeWork locations in New York, where the throw pillows implore busy tenants to “Do what you love.” Neon signs demand they “Hustle harder,” and murals spread the gospel of T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork’s water coolers have an agenda. “Don’t stop when you’re tired,” someone &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StevieBuckley/status/1040185357948608513&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently carved&lt;/a&gt; into the floating vegetables’ flesh. “Stop when you are done.” Kool-Aid drinking metaphors are rarely this literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Welcome to hustle culture. It is obsessed with striving, relentlessly positive, devoid of humor, and — once you notice it — impossible to escape. “Rise and Grind” is both the theme of a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ua5tDFaJM&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nike ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the title of a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0727T8WYZ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by a “Shark Tank” shark. New media upstarts like the Hustle, which produces a popular business newsletter and conference series, and One37pm, a content company created by the patron saint of hustling, Gary Vaynerchuk, glorify ambition not as a means to an end, but as a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The current state of entrepreneurship is bigger than career,” reads the One37pm &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.one37pm.com/about&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“About Us” page&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s ambition, grit and hustle. It’s a live performance that lights up your creativity … a sweat session that sends your endorphins coursing ... a visionary who expands your way of thinking.” From this point of view, not only does one never stop hustling — one never exits a kind of work rapture, in which the chief purpose of exercising or attending a concert is to get inspiration that leads back to the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ryan Harwood, the chief executive of One37pm’s parent company, told me that the site’s content is aimed at a younger generation of people who are seeking permission to follow their dreams. “They want to know how to own their moment, at any given moment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Owning one’s moment” is a clever way to rebrand “surviving the rat race.” In the new work culture, enduring or even merely liking one’s job is not enough. Workers should &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; what they do, and then promote that love on social media, thus fusing their identities to that of their employers. Why else would LinkedIn &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://qz.com/work/1470970/linkedin-is-testing-an-instagram-stories-competitor/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;build its own version&lt;/a&gt; of Snapchat Stories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is toil glamour, and it is going mainstream. Most visibly, WeWork — which investors recently valued at $47 billion — is on its way to becoming the Starbucks of office culture. It has exported its brand of performative workaholism to 27 countries, with 400,000 tenants, including workers from 30 percent of the Global Fortune 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In January, WeWork’s founder, Adam Neumann, announced that his start-up was rebranding itself as the We Company, to reflect an expansion into residential real estate and education. Describing the shift, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90289512/exclusive-wework-to-rebrand-to-the-we-company-in-wake-of-disappointing-funding-news&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; wrote: “Rather than just renting desks, the company aims to encompass all aspects of people’s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.” The ideal client, one imagines, is someone so enamored of the WeWork office aesthetic — whip-cracking cucumbers and all — that she sleeps in a WeLive apartment, works out at a Rise by We gym, and sends her children to a WeGrow school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;From this vantage, “Office Space,” the Gen-X slacker paean that came out 20 years ago next month, feels like science fiction from a distant realm. It’s almost impossible to imagine a start-up worker bee of today confessing, as protagonist Peter Gibbons does, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3u7bxz&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“It’s not that I’m lazy. It’s that I just don’t care.”&lt;/a&gt; Workplace indifference just doesn’t have a socially acceptable hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3ac70863&quot;&gt;‘It’s grim and exploitative’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s not difficult to view hustle culture as a swindle. After all, convincing a generation of workers to beaver away is convenient for those at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The vast majority of people beating the drums of hustle-mania are not the people doing the actual work. They’re the managers, financiers and owners,” said David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a software company. We spoke in October, as he was promoting his new book, “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/a&gt;,” about creating healthy company cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said that despite data showing long hours improve neither productivity nor creativity, myths about overwork persist because they justify the extreme wealth created for a small group of elite techies. “It’s grim and exploitative,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Elon Musk, who stands to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;reap stock compensation&lt;/a&gt; upward of $50 billion if his company, Tesla, meets certain performance levels, is a prime example of extolling work by the many that will primarily benefit him. He &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in November that there are easier places to work than Tesla, “but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” The correct number of hours “varies per person,” he continued, but is “about 80 sustained, peaking about 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Musk, who has more than 24 million Twitter followers, further noted that if you love what you do, “it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work.” Even he had to soften the lie of T.G.I.M. with a parenthetical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Arguably, the technology industry started this culture of work zeal sometime around the turn of the millennium, when the likes of Google started to feed, massage and even play doctor to its employees. The perks were meant to help companies attract the best talent — and keep employees at their desks longer. It seemed enviable enough: Who wouldn’t want an employer that literally took care of your dirty laundry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But today, as tech culture infiltrates every corner of the business world, its hymns to the virtues of relentless work remind me of nothing so much as &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/these-soviet-propaganda-posters-meant-to-evoke-heroism-pride&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soviet-era propaganda&lt;/a&gt;, which promoted impossible-seeming feats of worker productivity to motivate the labor force. One obvious difference, of course, is that those Stakhanovite posters had an &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;anti&lt;/em&gt;capitalist bent, criticizing the fat cats profiting from free enterprise. Today’s messages glorify personal profit, even if bosses and investors — not workers — are the ones capturing most of the gains. Wage growth has been essentially &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/01/business/economy/wages-salaries-job-market.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stagnant&lt;/a&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Perhaps we’ve all gotten a little hungry for meaning. Participation in organized religion &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/12/millennials-increasingly-are-driving-growth-of-nones/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is falling&lt;/a&gt;, especially among American millennials. In San Francisco, where I live, I’ve noticed that the concept of productivity has taken on an almost spiritual dimension. Techies here have internalized the idea — rooted in the Protestant work ethic — that work is not something you do to get what you want; the work itself is all. Therefore any life hack or company perk that optimizes their day, allowing them to fit in even more work, is not just desirable but inherently good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Aidan Harper, who created a European workweek-shrinkage campaign called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.4dayweek.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4 Day Week&lt;/a&gt;, argues that this is dehumanizing and toxic. “It creates the assumption that the only value we have as human beings is our productivity capability — our ability to work, rather than our humanity,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s cultist, Mr. Harper added, to convince workers to buy into their own exploitation with a change-the-world message. “It’s creating the idea that Elon Musk is your high priest,” he said. “You’re going into your church every day and worshiping at the altar of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For congregants of the Cathedral of Perpetual Hustle, spending time on anything that’s nonwork related has become a reason to feel guilty. Jonathan Crawford, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur, told me that he sacrificed his relationships and gained more than 40 pounds while working on Storenvy, his e-commerce start-up. If he socialized, it was at a networking event. If he read, it was a business book. He rarely did anything that didn’t have a “direct R.O.I.,” or return on investment, for his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Crawford changed his lifestyle after he realized it made him miserable. Now, as an entrepreneur-in-residence at 500 Start-ups, an investment firm, he tells fellow founders to seek out nonwork-related activities like reading fiction, watching movies or playing games. Somehow this comes off as radical advice. “It’s oddly eye-opening to them because they didn’t realize they saw themselves as a resource to be expended,” Mr. Crawford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s easy to become addicted to the pace and stress of work in 2019. Bernie Klinder, a consultant for a large tech company, said he tried to limit himself to five 11-hour days per week, which adds up to an extra day of productivity. “If your peers are competitive, working a ‘normal workweek’ will make you look like a slacker,” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Still, he’s realistic about his place in the rat race. “I try to keep in mind that if I dropped dead tomorrow, all of my acrylic workplace awards would be in the trash the next day,” he wrote, “and my job would be posted in the paper before my obituary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-7b07b7fb&quot;&gt;Lusty for Monday mornings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The logical endpoint of excessively avid work, of course, is burnout. That is the subject of a recent viral &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; by the BuzzFeed cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen, which thoughtfully addresses one of the incongruities of hustle-mania in the young. Namely: If Millennials are supposedly lazy and entitled, how can they also be obsessed with killing it at their jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Millennials, Ms. Petersen argues, are just desperately striving to meet their own high expectations. An entire generation was raised to expect that good grades and extracurricular overachievement would reward them with fulfilling jobs that feed their passions. Instead, they wound up with precarious, meaningless work and a mountain of student loan debt. And so posing as a rise-and-grinder, lusty for Monday mornings, starts to make sense as a defense mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most jobs — even most good jobs! — are full of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RWG7YM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointless drudgery&lt;/a&gt;. Most corporations let us down in some way. And yet years after the HBO satire “Silicon Valley” made the vacuous mission statement “making the world a better place” a recurring punch line, many companies still cheerlead the virtues of work with high-minded messaging. For example, Spotify, a company that lets you listen to music, says that its mission is “to unlock the potential of human creativity.” Dropbox, which lets you upload files and stuff, says its purpose is “to unleash the world’s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;David Spencer, a professor of economics at Leeds University Business School, says that such posturing by companies, economists and politicians dates at least to the rise of mercantilism in 16th-century Europe. “There has been an ongoing struggle by employers to venerate work in ways that distract from its unappealing features,” he said. But such propaganda can backfire. In 17th-century England, work was lauded as a cure for vice, Mr. Spencer said, but the unrewarding truth just drove workers to drink more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Internet companies may have miscalculated in encouraging employees to equate their work with their intrinsic value as human beings. After a long era of basking in positive esteem, the tech industry is experiencing a backlash both broad and fierce, on subjects from monopolistic behavior to spreading disinformation and inciting racial violence. And workers are discovering how much power they wield. In November, some 20,000 Googlers participated in a walkout protesting the company’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;handling of sexual abusers&lt;/a&gt;. Other company employees shut down an artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon that could have helped military drones become more lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Heinemeier Hansson cited the employee protests as evidence that millennial workers would eventually revolt against the culture of overwork. “People aren’t going to stand for this,” he said, using an expletive, “or buy the propaganda that eternal bliss lies at monitoring your own bathroom breaks.” He was referring to an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-marissa-mayer-interview-issue/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; that the former chief executive of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, gave in 2016, in which she said that working 130 hours a week was possible “if you’re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ultimately, workers must decide if they admire or reject this level of devotion. Ms. Mayer’s comments were widely panned on social media when the interview ran, but since then, Quora users have eagerly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-did-CEO-Marissa-Mayer-pull-all-nighters-and-130-hour-work-weeks-while-at-Google&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shared their own strategies&lt;/a&gt; for mimicking her schedule. Likewise, Mr. Musk’s “pain level” tweets drew plenty of critical takes, but they also garnered just as many accolades and requests for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The grim reality of 2019 is that begging a billionaire for employment via Twitter is not considered embarrassing, but a perfectly plausible way to get ahead. On some level, you have to respect the hustlers who see a dismal system and understand that success in it requires total, shameless buy-in. If we’re doomed to toil away until we die, we may as well pretend to like it. Even on Mondays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Undercover Agents Target Citizen Lab</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;NEW YORK — The researchers who reported that Israeli software was used to spy on Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's inner circle before his gruesome death are being targeted in turn by international undercover operatives, The Associated Press has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Twice in the past two months, men masquerading as socially conscious investors have lured members of the Citizen Lab internet watchdog group to meetings at luxury hotels to quiz them for hours about their work exposing Israeli surveillance and the details of their personal lives. In both cases, the researchers believe they were secretly recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert described the stunts as &quot;a new low.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;We condemn these sinister, underhanded activities in the strongest possible terms,&quot; he said in a statement Friday. &quot;Such a deceitful attack on an academic group like the Citizen Lab is an attack on academic freedom everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Who these operatives are working for remains a riddle, but their tactics recall those of private investigators who assume elaborate false identities to gather intelligence or compromising material on critics of powerful figures in government or business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers operating in places as far afield as Tibet , Ethiopia and Syria . Lately the group has drawn attention for its repeated exposés of an Israeli surveillance software vendor called the NSO Group, a firm whose wares have been used by governments to target journalists in Mexico , opposition figures in Panama and human rights activists in the Middle East .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In October, Citizen Lab reported that an iPhone belonging to one of Khashoggi's confidantes had been infected by the NSO's signature spy software only months before Khashoggi's grisly murder. The friend, Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, would later claim that the hacking had exposed Khashoggi's private criticisms of the Saudi royal family to the Arab kingdom's spies and thus &quot;played a major role&quot; in his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement, NSO denied having anything to do with the undercover operations targeting Citizen Lab, &quot;either directly or indirectly&quot; and said it had neither hired nor asked anyone to hire private investigators to pursue the Canadian organization. &quot;Any suggestion to the contrary is factually incorrect and nothing more than baseless speculation,&quot; NSO said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;NSO has long denied that its software was used to target Khashoggi, although it has refused to comment when asked whether it has sold its software to the Saudi government more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The first message reached Bahr Abdul Razzak, a Syrian refugee who works as a Citizen Lab researcher, Dec. 6, when a man calling himself Gary Bowman got in touch via LinkedIn. The man described himself as a South African financial technology executive based in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;I came across your profile and think that the work you've done helping Syrian refugees and your extensive technical background could be a great fit for our new initiative,&quot; Bowman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Abdul Razzak said he thought the proposal was a bit odd, but he eventually agreed to meet the man at Toronto's swanky Shangri-La Hotel on the morning of Dec. 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The conversation got weird very quickly, Abdul Razzak said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Instead of talking about refugees, Abdul Razzak said, Bowman grilled him about his work for Citizen Lab and its investigations into the use of NSO's software. Abdul Razzak said Bowman appeared to be reading off cue cards, asking him if he was earning enough money and throwing out pointed questions about Israel, the war in Syria and Abdul Razzak's religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you pray?&quot; Abdul Razzak recalled Bowman asking. &quot;Why do you write only about NSO?&quot; ''Do you write about it because it's an Israeli company?&quot; ''Do you hate Israel?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Abdul Razzak said he emerged from the meeting feeling shaken. He alerted his Citizen Lab colleagues, who quickly determined that the breakfast get-together had been a ruse. Bowman's supposed Madrid-based company, FlameTech, had no web presence beyond a LinkedIn page, a handful of social media profiles and an entry in the business information platform Crunchbase. A reverse image search revealed that the profile picture of the man listed as FlameTech's chief executive, Mauricio Alonso, was a stock photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;My immediate gut feeling was: 'This is a fake,'&quot; said John Scott-Railton, one of Abdul Razzak's colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scott-Railton flagged the incident to the AP, which confirmed that FlameTech was a digital facade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Searches of the Orbis database of corporate records, which has data on some 300 million global companies, turned up no evidence of a Spanish firm called FlameTech or Flame Tech or any company anywhere in the world matching its description. Similarly, the AP found no record of FlameTech in Madrid's official registry or of a Gary Bowman in the city's telephone listings. An Orbis search for Alonso, the supposed chief executive, also drew a blank. When an AP reporter visited Madrid's Crystal Tower high-rise, where FlameTech claimed to have 250 sq. meters (2,700 sq. feet) of office space, he could find no trace of the firm and calls to the number listed on its website went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The AP was about to publish a story about the curious company when, on Jan. 9, Scott-Railton received an intriguing message of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This time the contact came not from Bowman of FlameTech but from someone who identified himself as Michel Lambert, a director at the Paris-based agricultural technology firm CPW-Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lambert had done his homework. In his introductory email , he referred to Scott-Railton's early doctoral research on kite aerial photography — a mapping technique using kite-mounted cameras — and said he was &quot;quite impressed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;We have a few projects and clients coming up that could significantly benefit from implementing Kite Aerial Photography,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like FlameTech, CPW-Consulting was a fiction. Searches of Orbis and the French commercial court registry Infogreffe turned up no trace of the supposedly Paris-based company or indeed of any Paris-based company bearing the acronym CPW. And when the AP visited CPW's alleged office there was no evidence of the company; the address was home to a mainly residential apartment building. Residents and the building's caretaker said they had never heard of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Whoever dreamed up CPW had taken steps to ensure the illusion survived a casual web search, but even those efforts didn't bear much scrutiny. The company had issued a help wanted ad, for example, seeking a digital mapping specialist for their Paris office, but Scott-Railton discovered that the language had been lifted almost word-for-word from an ad from an unrelated company seeking a mapping specialist in London. A blog post touted CPW as a major player in Africa, but an examination of the author's profile suggests the article was the only one the blogger had ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Lambert suggested an in-person meeting in New York during a Jan. 19 phone call , Scott-Railton felt certain that Lambert was trying to set him up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Scott-Railton agreed to the meeting. He planned to lay a trap of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Anyone watching Scott-Railton and Lambert laughing over wagyu beef and lobster bisque at the Peninsula Hotel's upscale restaurant on Thursday afternoon might have mistaken the pair for friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In fact, the lunch was Spy vs. Spy. Scott-Railton had spent the night before trying to hide a homemade camera into his tie, he later told AP, eventually settling for a GoPro action camera and several recording devices hidden about his person. On the table, Lambert had placed a large pen in which Scott-Railton said he spotted a tiny camera lens peeking out from an opening in the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lambert didn't seem to be alone. At the beginning of the meal, a man sat behind him, holding up his phone as if to take pictures and then abruptly left the restaurant, having eaten nothing. Later, two or three men materialized at the bar and appeared to be monitoring proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scott-Railton wasn't alone either. A few tables away, two Associated Press journalists were making small talk as they waited for a signal from Scott-Railton, who had invited the reporters to observe the lunch from nearby and then interview Lambert near the end of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The conversation began with a discussion of kites, gossip about African politicians, and a detour through Scott-Railton's family background. But Lambert, just like Bowman, eventually steered the talk to Citizen Lab and NSO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;Work drama? Tell me, I like drama!&quot; Lambert said at one point, according to Scott-Railton's recording of the conversation. &quot;Is there a big competition between the people inside Citizen Lab?&quot; he asked later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like Bowman, Lambert appeared to be working off cue cards and occasionally made awkward conversational gambits. At one point he repeated a racist French expression, insisting it wasn't offensive. He also asked Scott-Railton questions about the Holocaust, anti-Semitism and whether he grew up with any Jewish friends. At another point he asked whether there might not be a &quot;racist element&quot; to Citizen Lab's interest in Israeli spyware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After dessert arrived, the AP reporters approached Lambert at his table and asked him why his company didn't seem to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He seemed to stiffen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;I know what I'm doing,&quot; Lambert said, as he put his files — and his pen — into a bag. Then he stood up, bumped into a chair and walked off, saying &quot;Ciao&quot; and waving his hand, before returning because he had neglected to pay the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As he paced around the restaurant waiting for the check, Lambert refused to answer questions about who he worked for or why no trace of his firm could be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;I don't have to give you any explanation,&quot; he said. He eventually retreated to a back room and closed the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Who Lambert and Bowman really are isn't clear. Neither man returned emails or phone calls. The websites for both of their supposed companies went offline within hours of the publication of this article, and chunks of information, including the men's last names, were removed from their respective LinkedIn profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Despite their keen focus on NSO, the AP has found no evidence that the men were linked to the Israeli spyware merchant, which is adamant that it wasn't involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The kind of aggressive investigative tactics used by the mystery men who targeted Citizen Lab have come under fire in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal. Black Cube, an Israeli private investigation firm, apologized after The New Yorker and other media outlets revealed that the company's operatives had used subterfuge and dirty tricks to help the Hollywood mogul suppress allegations of rape and sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scott-Railton and Abdul Razzak said they didn't want to speculate about who was involved. But both said they believed they were being steered toward making controversial comments that could be used to blacken Citizen Lab's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;It could be they wanted me to say, 'Yes, I hate Israel,' or 'Yes, Citizen Lab is against NSO because it's Israeli,'&quot; said Abdul Razzak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Scott-Railton said the elaborate, multinational operation was gratifying, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;People were paid to fly to a city to sit you down to an expensive meal and try to convince you to say bad things about your work, your colleagues and your employer,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&quot;That means that your work is important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lori Hinnant and Nicholas Garriga in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Joseph Frederick in New York contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Snark Barker: A 100% compatible replica of the famed SB 1.0 soundcard</title>
<link>https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Snark Barker is a 100% compatible clone of the famed SB 1.0 &quot;Killer Card&quot; sound card from 1989. It implements all the features, including the digital sound playback and recording, Ad Lib compatible synthesis, the joystick/MIDI port, and the CMS chips (which are actually Philips SAA1099 synthesizer devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/images/SnarkBarker.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/raw/master/images/SnarkBarker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snark Barker photo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the components are readily available. In the bill of materials, Mouser part numbers are listed where they are available. Chips not available from Mouser can be purchased from a variety of sources in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.pdf&quot;&gt;Schematic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.csv&quot;&gt;Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the 0.1&quot; header pins are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; listed on the BOM. They are standard breakaway headers (both single and double row). Jumper shunts are also not listed on the BOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/fab/SnarkBarker.zip&quot;&gt;Fab files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board dimensions are 9.1 x 4.2 inches. When ordering the board, you may want to specify a card edge bevel (fairly cheap!) and selective gold plating (expensive!) depending on your needs. The soldermask color can be whatever you like, but hot pink is preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Volume Knob&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There don't seem to be any off-the-shelf knobs compatible with the Alps potentiometer. You may be able to 3D print one based on the model below. I'd recommend using a high-resolution SLA printer like the Formlabs Form 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasten it to the potentiometer using an M1.4x0.3mm thread, 6mm long screw (McMaster-Carr part number 91800A036 or equivalent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/images/vol_knob.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/raw/master/images/vol_knob.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of the volume knob&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/mech/vol_knob.zip&quot;&gt;Volume knob STEP model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ISA Card Bracket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bracket specified in the BOM is a blank Keystone 9200 bracket. You will need to punch or drill holes for the connectors. The KiCad board file has detailed dimensions showing where to make the holes in the bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a chassis nibbler tool to make the square slot for the volume knob as well as the hole for the DA-15 joystick/MIDI connector. If you are rich, Greenlee makes a punch for the DA-15 outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Firmware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get a programmed 80C51 chip for the Snark Barker. One is to purchase a SB 2.0 DSP chip from China and put it in a 44-PLCC to 40-DIP adapter. This works fine and provides the largest feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to buy a blank Atmel 89S51 (as listed in the BOM) and program it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/firmware/sb.hex&quot;&gt;this HEX file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assembly Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may wish to socket the two CMS chips, the 80C51 microcontroller, and the two Yamaha chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to add the 4.7K ohm bodge resistor on top of U5, running between pins 4 and 14. (Shown below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/images/bodge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/raw/master/images/bodge.png&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of bodge resistor&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For MIDI to work properly, you'll need to solder jumper wires on the headers marked TXD and RXD (next to the SNARK BARKER logo). Originally these two 3-pin headers may have been used as a debug port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to place shunts in the jumpers marked DRQ1 and JP1, to enable DMA and the joystick, respectively. Also place shunts to configure the I/O address and IRQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the original SB 1.0, the Snark Barker does not need a -5V rail.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fossil vs Git</title>
<link>https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;1.0 Don't Stress!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start out using one DVCS and later decide you like the other better, you can easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/inout.wiki&quot;&gt;move your content&lt;/a&gt;¹.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil and &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; are very similar in many respects, but they also have important differences. See the table below for a high-level summary and the text that follows for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you are reading this on a Fossil website, and though we try to be fair, the information here might be biased in favor of Fossil. Ask around for second opinions from people who have used &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Fossil and Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Git does not support wiki, tickets, or tech-notes, so those elements will not transfer when exporting from Fossil to Git.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.0 Differences Between Fossil And Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences between Fossil and Git are summarized by the following table, with further description in the text that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;GIT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;FOSSIL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;File versioning only&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Versioning, Tickets, Wiki, and Technotes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ad-hoc, pile-of-files key/value database&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Relational SQL database&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bazaar-style development&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cathedral-style development&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Designed for Linux development&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Designed for SQLite development&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lots of little tools&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stand-alone executable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;One check-out per repository&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Many check-outs per repository&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Remembers what you should have done&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Remembers what you actually did&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;GPL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BSD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.1 Feature Set&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git provides file versioning services only, whereas Fossil adds integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/wikitheory.wiki&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/bugtheory.wiki&quot;&gt;ticketing &amp;amp; bug tracking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/embeddeddoc.wiki&quot;&gt;embedded documentation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/event.wiki&quot;&gt;Technical notes&lt;/a&gt;. These additional capabilities are available for Git as 3rd-party and/or user-installed add-ons, but with Fossil they are integrated into the design. One way to describe Fossil is that it is &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;-in-a-box&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you clone Git's self-hosting repository you get just Git's source code. If you clone Fossil's self-hosting repository, you get the entire Fossil website - source code, documentation, ticket history, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers who choose to self-host projects (rather than using a 3rd-party service such as GitHub) Fossil is much easier to set up, since the stand-alone Fossil executable together with a 2-line CGI script suffice to instantiate a full-featured developer website. To accomplish the same using Git requires locating, installing, configuring, integrating, and managing a wide assortment of separate tools. Standing up a developer website using Fossil can be done in minutes, whereas doing the same using Git requires hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.2 Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseline data structures for Fossil and Git are the same (modulo formatting details). Both systems store check-ins as immutable objects referencing their immediate ancestors and named by a cryptographic hash of the check-in content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is that Git stores its objects as individual files in the &quot;.git&quot; folder or compressed into bespoke &quot;pack-files&quot;, whereas Fossil stores its objects in a relational (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;) database file. To put it another way, Git uses an ad-hoc pile-of-files key/value database whereas Fossil uses a proven, general-purpose SQL database. This difference is more than an implementation detail. It has important consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Git, one can easily locate the ancestors of a particular check-in by following the pointers embedded in the check-in object, but it is difficult to go the other direction and locate the descendants of a check-in. It is so difficult, in fact, that neither native Git nor GitHub provide this capability. With Git, if you are looking at some historical check-in then you cannot ask &quot;what came next&quot; or &quot;what are the children of this check-in&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil, on the other hand, parses essential information about check-ins (parents, children, committers, comments, files changed, etc.) into a relational database that can be easily queried using concise SQL statements to find both ancestors and descendents of a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaf check-ins in Git that lack a &quot;ref&quot; become &quot;detached&quot;, making them difficult to locate and subject to garbage collection. This &quot;detached head&quot; problem has caused untold grief for countless Git users. With Fossil, all check-ins are easily located using a variety of attributes (parents, children, committer, date, full-text search of the check-in comment) and so detached heads are simply not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease with which check-ins can be located and queried in Fossil has resulted in a huge variety of reports and status screens (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/webpage-ex.md&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;) that show project state in ways that help developers maintain enhanced awareness and comprehension and avoid errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.3 Cathedral vs. Bazaar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil and Git promote different development styles. Git promotes a &quot;bazaar&quot; development style in which numerous anonymous developers make small and sometimes haphazard contributions. Fossil promotes a &quot;cathedral&quot; development model in which the project is closely supervised by an highly engaged architect and implemented by a clique of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nota Bene: This is not to say that Git cannot be used for cathedral-style development or that Fossil cannot be used for bazaar-style development. They can be. But those modes are not their design intent nor their low-friction path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git encourages a style in which individual developers work in relative isolation, maintaining their own branches and occasionally rebasing and pushing selected changes up to the main repository. Developers using Git often have their own private branches that nobody else ever sees. Work becomes siloed. This is exactly what one wants when doing bazaar-style development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil, in contrast, strives to keep all changes from all contributors mirrored in the main repository (in separate branches) at all times. Work in progress from one developer is readily visible to all other developers and to the project leader, well before the code is ready to integrate. Fossil places a lot of emphasis on reporting the state of the project, and the changes underway by all developers, so that all developers and especially the project leader can maintain a better mental picture of what is happening, and better situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.4 Linux vs. SQLite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git was specifically designed to support the development of Linux. Fossil was specifically designed to support the development of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both SQLite and Linux are important pieces of software. SQLite is found on far more systems than Linux. (Almost every Linux system uses SQLite, but there are many non-Linux systems such as iPhones, PlayStations, and Windows PCs that use SQLite.) On the other hand, for those systems that do use Linux, Linux is a far more important component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux uses a bazaar-style development model. There are thousands and thousands of contributors, most of whom do not know each others names. Git is designed for this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite uses cathedral-style development. 95% of the code in SQLite comes from just three programmers, 64% from just the lead developer. And all SQLite developers know each other well and interact daily. Fossil is designed for this development model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.5 Lots of little tools vs. Self-contained system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git consists of many small tools, each doing one small part of the job, which can be recombined (by experts) to perform powerful operations. Git has a lot of complexity and many dependencies and requires an &quot;installer&quot; script or program to get it running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil is a single self-contained stand-alone executable with hardly any dependencies. Fossil can be (and often is) run inside a minimally configured chroot jail. To install Fossil, one merely puts the executable on $PATH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer of Git says that the unix philosophy is to have lots of small tools that collaborate to get the job done. The designer of Fossil says that the unix philosophy is &quot;it just works&quot;. Both individuals have written their DVCSes to reflect their own view of the &quot;unix philosophy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.6 One vs. Many Check-outs per Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;repository&quot; in Git is a pile-of-files in the &quot;.git&quot; subdirectory of a single check-out. The check-out and the repository are inseperable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fossil, a &quot;repository&quot; is a single SQLite database file that can be stored anywhere. There can be multiple active check-outs from the same repository, perhaps open on different branches or on different snapshots of the same branch. Long-running tests or builds can be running in one check-out while changes are being committed in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.7 What you should have done vs. What you actually did&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git puts a lot of emphasis on maintaining a &quot;clean&quot; check-in history. Extraneous and experimental branches by individual developers often never make it into the main repository. And branches are often rebased before being pushed, to make it appear as if development had been linear. Git strives to record what the development of a project should have looked like had there been no mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil, in contrast, puts more emphasis on recording exactly what happened, including all of the messy errors, dead-ends, experimental branches, and so forth. One might argue that this makes the history of a Fossil project &quot;messy&quot;. But another point of view is that this makes the history &quot;accurate&quot;. In actual practice, the superior reporting tools available in Fossil mean that the added &quot;mess&quot; is not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commentator has mused that Git records history according to the victors, whereas Fossil records history as it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.8 GPL vs. BSD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is covered by the GPL license whereas Fossil is covered by a two-clause BSD license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the difference between GPL and BSD licenses: GPL is designed to make writing easier at the expense of making reading harder. BSD is designed to make reading easier at the expense of making writing harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a first approximation, the GPL license grants the right to read source code to anyone who promises to give back enhancements. In other words, the act of reading GPL source code (a prerequiste for making changes) implies acceptance of the license which requires updates to be contributed back under the same license. (The details are more complex, but the foregoing captures the essence of the idea.) A big advantage of the GPL is that anybody can contribute to the code without having to sign additional legal documentation because they have implied their acceptance of the GPL license by the very act of reading the source code. This means that a GPL project can legally accept anonymous and drive-by patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSD licenses, on the other hand, make reading much easier than the GPL, because the reader need not surrender proprietary interest in their own enhancements. On the flip side, BSD and similarly licensed projects must obtain legal affidavits from authors before new content can be added into the project. Anonymous and drive-by patches cannot be accepted. This makes signing up new contributors for BSD licensed projects harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licenses on the implementations of Git and Fossil only apply to the implementations themselves, not to the projects which the systems store. Nevertheless, one can see a more GPL-oriented world-view in Git and a more BSD-oriented world-view in Fossil. Git encourages anonymous contributions and siloed development, which are hallmarks of the GPL/bazaar approach to software, whereas Fossil encourages a more tightly collaborative, cliquish, cathedral-style approach more typical of BSD-licensed projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.0 Missing Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the capabilities found in Git are also available in Fossil and the other way around. For example, both systems have local check-outs, remote repositories, push/pull/sync, bisect capabilities, and a &quot;stash&quot;. Both systems store project history as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of immutable check-in objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a few capabilities in one system that are missing from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.1 Features found in Fossil but missing from Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to show descendents of a check-in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Git and Fossil can easily find the ancestors of a check-in. But only Fossil shows the descendents. (It is possible to find the descendents of a check-in in Git using the log, but that is sufficiently difficult that nobody ever actually does it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wiki, Embedded documentation, Trouble-tickets, and Tech-Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git only provides versioning of source code. Fossil strives to provide other related configuration management services as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named branches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.711475409836&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branches in Fossil have persistent names that are propagated to collaborators via &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=push&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=pull&quot;&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt;. All developers see the same name on the same branch. Git, in contrast, uses only local branch names, so developers working on the same project can (and frequently do) use a different name for the same branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil keeps track of all repositories and check-outs and allows operations over all of them with a single command. For example, in Fossil is possible to request a pull of all repositories on a laptop from their respective servers, prior to taking the laptop off network. Or it is possible to do &quot;fossil all status&quot; to see if there are any uncommitted changes that were overlooked prior to the end of the workday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil supports an integrated web interface. Some of the same features are available using third-party add-ons for Git, but they do not provide nearly as many features and they are not nearly as convenient to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.2 Features found in Git but missing from Fossil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its emphasis on recording history exactly as it happened, rather than as we would have liked it to happen, Fossil deliberately does not provide a &quot;rebase&quot; command. One can rebase manually in Fossil, with sufficient perserverence, but it is not something that can be done with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push or pull a single branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.9932203389831&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=push&quot;&gt;fossil push&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=pull&quot;&gt;fossil pull&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=sync&quot;&gt;fossil sync&lt;/a&gt; commands do not provide the capability to push or pull individual branches. Pushing and pulling in Fossil is all or nothing. This is in keeping with Fossil's emphasis on maintaining a complete record and on sharing everything between all developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
