        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Apple has been fined 25 million euros (£21m, $27m) for deliberately slowing down older iPhone models without making it clear to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine was imposed by France's competition and fraud watchdog DGCCRF, which said consumers were not warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Apple confirmed that it did slow down some iPhones, but said it only did so to &quot;prolong the life&quot; of the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple said in a statement that it had resolved the issue with the watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Why does Apple slow down old iPhones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many customers had long suspected that Apple slowed down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade when a new one was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the company confirmed it did slow down some models as they aged, but not to encourage people to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the lithium-ion batteries in the devices became less capable of supplying peak current demands, as they aged over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could result in an iPhone unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it released a software update for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE which &quot;smoothed out&quot; battery performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged, but had suddenly speeded up again after the battery had been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What did the regulator say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French watchdog said iPhone owners &quot;were not informed that installing iOS updates (10.2.1 and 11.2) could slow down their devices&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Apple must display a notice on its French-language website for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says Apple &quot;committed the crime of deceptive commercial practice by omission&quot; and had agreed to pay the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Does Apple still slow down older iPhones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Since Apple confirmed the practice in 2017, it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;implemented it on several more iPhones&lt;/a&gt; including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone 7 and 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone 8 and 8 Plus running iOS 12.1 or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone X running iOS 12.1 or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;iPhone XS, XS Max and XR running iOS 13.1 or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting is only enabled when the battery begins to degrade, and iOS now offers clearer information to consumers about when performance management has been switched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The effects of performance management on these newer models may be less noticeable due to their more advanced hardware and software design,&quot; Apple said. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Global warming has begun to make Norway warmer and wetter</title>

When you talk about climate change, it is easy to just scream about the negative and dramatic. In reality it is, as always, &lt;em&gt;a bit more nuanced&lt;/em&gt;. For example, we must mention that Norway has gotten off relatively lightly in terms of drought so far, all things considered. We in the north are also lucky when it comes to &lt;em&gt;rising sea level&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;storms&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, not all climate changes in Norway are &lt;em&gt;purely negative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On Resigning from Google</title>
<link>https://www.alphabetworkers.org/resignation-letter/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.alphabetworkers.org/resignation-letter/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Bruce Hahne&lt;br/&gt;February 7, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The trouble with deep belief is that it costs something… if I actually believe these things I have to do something about them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;– Donald Miller, &lt;em&gt;Blue Like Jazz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;A little bit more of why we made this decision — it is principally a moral decision. It was entirely a moral decision… It’s something that, upon seeing it so blatant, so firsthand… we decided we simply can’t live with being a cog in that machine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;– Sergey Brin, remarks to employees on Google’s decision to shut down the company’s censored search engine in China, January 15, 2010. He received a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 7, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my coworkers at Google, and to those considering employment at Google,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extended period of discernment that’s spanned many months, I’ve reached the conclusion that Google’s current business practices and ethics are incompatible with me continuing to work for the company. Given that conclusion, I’ve made the decision to leave. You can find some of the articles that have informed my decision at go/2018-to-2020, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alphabetworkers.org/google-timeline-2018-20/&quot;&gt;externally at alphabetworkers.org&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not switching to another employer – instead, I hope to spend my time working on justice issues, and on growing and strengthening the nascent tech labor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alphabetworkers.org/&quot;&gt;previously recommended&lt;/a&gt; that Google reformers should try to share their stories, and that leaving the company can be an appropriate story-telling time, I felt I should follow my own advice by sharing a few stories here. I won’t cover all of the corporate ethical failures that have led to my resignation, but I can touch on three areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Persecution and firing of transgender and gay employees for their efforts to reform the firm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 2000’s, when I served on the board of a small Presbyterian church that was part of the national Presbyterian Church USA (PCUSA), there was a national antagonist whose name, ironically, was Paul. Paul, the lawyer. Paul apparently believed that his job was to purge the PCUSA of all the gay people, the pastors who supported gay people, the pastors who conducted wedding ceremonies for gay people, and for good measure, various pastors who served at LGBTQ-friendly churches. At the time, the national PCUSA constitution was homophobic – it contained specific language that targeted openly gay and lesbian people. The growing pro-LGBTQ equality movement within the denomination, however, resisted both this language and its implementation, paralleling the broader gay rights movement within the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national PCUSA governing rules allowed for a form of “attack from afar”, in which an out-of-region antagonist could simply mail or fax allegations of church constitutional violations to the local church governing body, forcing pastors to be put on trial for heresy – the “heresy” here typically one of “you’re openly gay” or “you officiated at a same-sex wedding”. Attacks like this were an attack on people’s jobs and physical security: if you can strip a reform-oriented pastor of their PCUSA ordination, you also strip them of their employment and their health insurance, because you can’t serve as a Presbyterian pastor if you’ve been stripped of your ordination as the result of a church judicial action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Paul the lawyer warmed up his fax machine, fired up his word processor, and began to fax anti-gay accusations of heresy around the country. How easy it must have been! There was no need to speak to the person you were attacking, no need to treat them like a human being, just press a button on your fax machine, and that would summon a committee somewhere else to take care of the mechanics of threatening somebody’s job. The attacks caused tremendous fear, they caused organizational chaos, they harmed the national denomination, and they forced many good people to lose their jobs or simply leave the PCUSA for other denominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent spate of Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations&quot;&gt;firings&lt;/a&gt; of LGBTQ employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/google-firing-protest-rebecca-rivers&quot;&gt;for their activism&lt;/a&gt;, including Laurence Berland, Rebecca Rivers, Sophie Waldman, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workingsolutionsnyc.com/google-fires-another-transgender-employee-activist/&quot;&gt;Kathryn Spiers&lt;/a&gt;, I see far too many similarities to what we experienced in the PCUSA twenty years ago. There’s the same “urge to purge” by institutional forces and actors who would rather strip people of their jobs than change the institution’s behavior. There’s the same attack-by-remote-control, in which the decisionmakers don’t have to confront the people they’re hurting, don’t have to think of them as human beings – just click a button in a personnel management tool, send an execution email to HR, have them find a nebulously-worded corporate policy to apply, prepare a statement for the media, and push a few more politically expendable employees out the door. Purge all of the troublemakers, the thinking goes, and our organization will be pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn’t work in the PCUSA, where activists eventually won the fight to remove homophobia from the church constitution, and won the fight for marriage equality; and it’s unlikely to work at Google. The reason it’s unlikely to work is that although you can persecute the prophets, you can’t silence the truth that they speak. A prophet, both historically and today, is someone who holds a mirror up to an institution and says “this is what you are, this is what you have become, and it’s time for you to change.” Google can fire as many people as it likes, but the truth of that image in the mirror isn’t going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Google Cloud sales to the oil and gas industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the world dies by fire, it will be in part due to cloud compute sales to the oil and gas industry by the big three cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t been following this topic in the news, Google has been aggressively working to sell its cloud computing and machine learning services to the oil and gas industry since at least 2018, when it hired Darryl Willis, formerly of British Petroleum, as its first “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/darryl-willis&quot;&gt;VP of Oil, Gas, and Energy&lt;/a&gt;” in March 2018. Mr. Willis left Google after only 18 months and is now with Microsoft, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-gas&quot;&gt;Google’s efforts to sell into the oil and gas vertical continue&lt;/a&gt;. Google NEXT 2018 featured presentations such as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXt7gVz5EPs&quot;&gt;How Machine Learning is Impacting Oil and Gas&lt;/a&gt;”, and the external Google Cloud &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/energy/&quot;&gt;marketing content&lt;/a&gt; features oil field services company Schlumberger as a reference customer, noting that “As their computing demands grow, oil and gas companies like Schlumberger rely on Google Cloud to scale workloads, such as seismic interpretation, regression analysis and classification, and fast basin modeling and simulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is twofold: every additional ton of carbon that we humans put into the atmosphere is killing us and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/118651830/over-1-billion-animals-feared-dead-in-australian-bushfires&quot;&gt;every other living creature&lt;/a&gt;, and every sale of cloud technology into the oil and gas sector &lt;em&gt;lowers the underlying cost structure&lt;/em&gt; of those industries, making them more cost-competitive against wind and solar. Lowering the cost of discovering and extracting oil and gas in turn increases the likelihood that investors will fund new oil and gas plants, and increases the number of years that it will take for renewables to drive out carbon energy sources from a profitability standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to decisions about whether or not to build an industrial-scale power plant, whether it’s an oil refinery or a solar farm, everything comes down to a large Excel spreadsheet. The profitability projections are derived from this Excel spreadsheet, the investment banks want to see the spreadsheet, and the project go/no-go decisions are derived from the spreadsheet. The financial discipline of how to fund and project the profitability of large infrastructure projects is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_finance&quot;&gt;Project Finance&lt;/a&gt;” — I took a course on this as part of my Berkeley MBA back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project finance decision spreadsheet is large, messy, tedious, and completely lacking in ethics. The spreadsheet’s job is to take a large set of project assumptions, including estimates of the cost of capital, interest rates, and project risk over time, and extrapolate cash flows out for at least 30 years. Below is an extract of what one of these sheets looks like. If I were to screenshot the whole thing it would be completely unreadable, since it runs cash flows on a quarterly basis from 2017 to 2051.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.alphabetworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/project-finance-sample-spreadsheet-extract-1024x594.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-111&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.alphabetworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/project-finance-sample-spreadsheet-extract-1024x594.png 1024w, https://www.alphabetworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/project-finance-sample-spreadsheet-extract-300x174.png 300w, https://www.alphabetworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/project-finance-sample-spreadsheet-extract-768x445.png 768w, https://www.alphabetworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/project-finance-sample-spreadsheet-extract-500x290.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure: A small portion of a project finance spreadsheet.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This one happens to be for a solar farm, but it could just as easily be for an oil refinery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any change to the cost assumptions in the project spreadsheet will change the predicted profitability of the overall project. Small changes to underlying costs, when propagated across a 35-year operating plan, can have a significant impact on a project’s viability, and in particular on whether an investment bank believes that it can make more money from the oil refinery, or more money from a solar or wind farm. You have $500 million to invest in the energy sector: which do you choose, the oil refinery or the solar farm? It all comes down to the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google’s cloud and AI/ML technology can reduce the overall costs of finding, extracting, and processing oil and gas, and reduce the cost of oil and gas power plants by even 1% — and I certainly could believe that 1% is possible — the results for the planet will be dire. More large-scale investment dollars diverted to oil and gas, more oil and gas refineries built, more oil and gas extracted, while zero-carbon energy generation gets deployed more slowly, or simply not deployed at all because the capital investment is going into cheaper oil and gas. That’s how we die by fire – one cost-reducing Google cloud service at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah”, you say, “but Google purchases wind and solar power for its data centers, I read that on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/renewable/&quot;&gt;public relations page somewhere&lt;/a&gt;! Surely that must count for something?” Well, no, not really – not compared to Cloud’s potential to keep the oil and gas sector financially viable and to crowd out the transition to zero-carbon production. Let’s look at the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/788540/energy-consumption-of-google/&quot;&gt;Public estimates of Google’s total annual data center power consumption&lt;/a&gt; suggest that Google data centers consumed about 10.6 TWh (terawatt-hours) of electricity in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption&quot;&gt;global energy consumption&lt;/a&gt; of oil in 2015 was about 50,000 TWh, and 35000 TWh for gas, for a total of 85000 TWh across the oil and gas sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– So energy consumption in the oil and gas sector, into which Google Cloud is selling its cost-reducing services, is &lt;em&gt;four orders of magnitude larger&lt;/em&gt; than Google’s data center decarbonization efforts. The harm that Google Cloud will do to the planet, if it reduces underlying costs of this industry by even a small percent, completely dwarfs the data center decarbonization work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a Good Thing that Google purchases zero-carbon energy for its data centers? Of course, and there are many employees working hard on decarbonization – I’ve been there myself, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://go/neogeo&quot;&gt;20% project&lt;/a&gt; to contribute towards internal product decarbonization back in early 2019. However, the green data center efforts have no material impact when compared to the dire effects of cost-structure reduction on the entire energy industry. What’s actually happening with Google’s zero-carbon data center efforts is similar to what we see from many large firms that cause harm with their business practices: an effort to purchase indulgences, cancellations of sin, in the public mind. When accused of contributing to the climate crisis, Google simply needs to pull out the data center decarbonization slide deck and say “see, we do good things too!” It’s a widely-used tactic that’s also used, for example, to deflect criticisms of homophobic and transphobic content on Youtube. Unfortunately, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/118651830/over-1-billion-animals-feared-dead-in-australian-bushfires&quot;&gt;one billion animals dead&lt;/a&gt; from the climate-induced Australia brush fires aren’t around to see that decarbonization slide deck, and as I write this the country is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/03/climate/australia-fires-air.html&quot;&gt;breathing toxic smog&lt;/a&gt;. We’re dying by fire, and the Google Cloud oil and gas sales vertical is pouring on the gasoline. Google employees working on data center decarbonization need to be aware that your work is a double-edged sword – while it does result in the purchase of more wind and solar power, Google also uses your work as part of a broader greenwashing effort to derail conversations about the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-gas&quot;&gt;Google is part of the supply chain to the oil and gas sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Expansion into the weapons industry and the business of killing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in early 2018, it was revealed that Google was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/265145-google-pentagon-project-maven-ai-military-drones&quot;&gt;contributing to artificial intelligence for drone warfare&lt;/a&gt;, with project Maven. A combination of internal and external &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; eventually led to a commitment &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620&quot;&gt;not to renew the contract when it expired&lt;/a&gt;. The urge to pursue military contracts, however, didn’t disappear, it just mutated, rearing its head again in November 2019 with SVP Kent Walker’s infamous comment at an AI conference that when it comes to military contracts, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/2019/11/google-pentagon-pledge-to-work-together-were-eager-to-do-more/&quot;&gt;we’re eager to do more.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard “we’re eager to more”, I recalled what’s now a 40-year-old document from the Presbyterian Church titled &lt;em&gt;Peacemaking: The Believers’ Calling,&lt;/em&gt; one that both my father and I studied back when it was first released. Somebody at the denomination thankfully decided that it’s worth keeping a copy online for historical purposes, and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcusa.org/resource/peacemaking/&quot;&gt;online it is&lt;/a&gt;. Written during the slog of the cold war, and released not long before the massive military buildups of the Reagan administration, its opening remarks feel as striking to me today as they were 40 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Ominous clouds hang over human history. There are frightening risks in the continuing arms race and looming conflicts over diminishing energy resources as centers of power struggle for control. Our fear for safety has led us to trust in the false security of arms; our sin of war has led us to take life; and now we are in danger of taking our own lives as well.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcusa.org/site_media/media/uploads/_resolutions/peacemaking.pdf&quot;&gt;Peacemaking: The Believer’s Calling&lt;/a&gt;, UPCUSA, 1980&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2020, the U.S. President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/2020/1/3/headlines/us_assassinates_powerful_iranian_general_qassim_suleimani_at_baghdad_airport&quot;&gt;assassinated Iranian General Qassem Soleimani&lt;/a&gt;, risking the possibility of World War 3, using drone warfare technology. At the time I recall thinking: I wonder how much of project Maven was in that drone, pushing us that much closer to a global catastrophe? I wonder what other weapons projects are already underway at Google that the company isn’t telling us about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a firm that wants to aggressively pursue military contracts simply isn’t compatible with how I want to live my life. The well-known Biblical vision of divine intent for relationships between the nations comes from Isaiah 2:4: “&lt;em&gt;they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.&lt;/em&gt;” That’s the divine intent for human beings, mediated through a human being who put it into words, and it’s our responsibility to pursue that divine intent. “We’re eager to do more” goes in the opposite direction. I don’t want to work for a firm that turns plowshares into swords, or lines of code into weapons of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestions for current and candidate employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I already released an overly verbose set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alphabetworkers.org/&quot;&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the Google reform movement back in November 2019, here I’ll keep these additional suggestions brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For current Google employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. For yourself, discern and write down the corporate behavioral line which, if crossed by Google, will trigger your resignation. You don’t want to be like the proverbial frog that’s cooked in hot water, enduring an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alphabetworkers.org/google-timeline-2018-20/&quot;&gt;ongoing series of corporate ethical violations&lt;/a&gt;, each one at least as painful as the last, and then wake up one morning and find that you don’t know yourself anymore. This ethical line is different for each person. For me, it was consciously crossed when Kent Walker sat on a stage and said “we’re eager to do more”, though I soon realized that the pressure had been building over several years, manifesting as lack of sleep, weight loss, and inability to even enjoy taking a vacation. What matters is that you spend time in discernment to consider your own moral boundaries, and how you’ll enforce those boundaries when somebody tries to violate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it helps, here’s one way to get started. I was working through my old Berkeley MBA course material a few weeks ago when I discovered a slide deck from the ethics class, which is required of all Berkeley/Haas MBA students. The instructor made one particular summary slide titled “Questions to Ask” that pulls from multiple ethical traditions, and that offers some starter questions for discernment. From the slide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Would I be happy for this decision to be on the public record?&lt;br/&gt;– What would happen if everybody did this?&lt;br/&gt;– How would I like it if someone did this to me?&lt;br/&gt;– Will the proposed course of action bring about a good result?&lt;br/&gt;– What will the proposed course of action do to my character or the character of my organization?&lt;br/&gt;– Is the proposed course of action consistent with my espoused values and principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also found the analysis &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appropriatingtechnology.org/?q=node/296&quot;&gt;Ten Rules of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by University of Sussex researcher Tony Roberts to be useful, as it cuts through some of the misguided framings that can derail us when we attempt to think through the ethics of applied technology. Insights include “Technologies are inherently political”, “Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral”, and “Algorithms are human agency and interests, encoded”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The reason why there’s a book titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IBM and the Holocaust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which details IBM’s in-depth complicity in providing the IT services and logistical support for mass murder, is due to two root causes: ethically impaired, profit-obsessed executives, and a large base of rank and file employees who were Just Trying To Do Their Jobs. Within Google, as an employee you can’t do much about the executives, who if anything have tripled down on their hunger for revenue, but you can absolutely control your own choices and actions. When that day comes, and you’re asked to cross that behavioral line that you’ve already discerned, here is what you do: you look your manager in the eye, and you quote Sergey Brin from 2010: “I will not be a cog in that machine”. Part of your job as a human being is to ensure that 30 years from now, there’s not a book titled &lt;em&gt;Google and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/us-customs-border-protection-testing-google-cloud-anthos-2019-8&quot;&gt;Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt; Concentration Camps,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Google and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/03/06/google-us-military-machine-learning-drones/&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare&lt;/a&gt; Murders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people considering employment at Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. As you do your due diligence on the firm, your research should focus on events from 2019 and later, and your conversations should be with employees who have work experience at the firm from 2019 and beyond. Longer service is obviously better, but conversations with people who left in 2017 or earlier may play out differently from conversations with current employees. The best estimates that we have at the moment are that Google’s executive management &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html&quot;&gt;engaged the services of anti-labor consulting firm IRI Consultants&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, and it’s been throughout 2019 that, in hindsight, a variety of decisions have the appearance of being made in consultation with a firm that provides advice on how to control employees, muzzle their speech, and set them against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Google, obviously, isn’t its brand – it isn’t the meticulously-curated happy, playful, crayola-crayon-colors entity of the marketing materials or the Super Bowl commercials. It’s a Fortune 50 multinational corporation, and it wants what every Fortune 50 multinational corporation wants, which is more revenue and lower costs. Keep in mind that you’re joining a firm which is long past its startup days, and which has been turning the screws on cost containment for many departments for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Google’s informal motto is no longer “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html&quot;&gt;You can make money without doing evil&lt;/a&gt;”. A better replacement at this point might be “You can make even more money if you don’t care who suffers”. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-theyre-facing-retaliation/&quot;&gt;retaliating against the organizers of the Womens’ Walkout&lt;/a&gt;, to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/mbzz8x/twitter-youtube-wont-ban-white-nationalism-facebook&quot;&gt;reticence to ban white nationalism on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/us-customs-border-protection-testing-google-cloud-anthos-2019-8&quot;&gt;doing business with the U.S. Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt;, to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.packtpub.com/google-rejects-all-13-shareholder-proposals-at-its-annual-meeting-despite-protesting-workers/&quot;&gt;rejection of every single reform proposal&lt;/a&gt; at the 2019 shareholder’s meeting, this isn’t the Google of 2005 when I joined, or of 2010 when the company refused to be complicit with China’s search censorship, or even of 2017. This is the IRI-Consultants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929524/google-surveillance-tool-accused-employee-activism-protests-union-organizing&quot;&gt;internal-spyware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations&quot;&gt;fire-the-labor-activists&lt;/a&gt; Google of 2019 and beyond. Be sure that you’re aware of what you’re choosing before you sign up. The internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2019/10/24/google-accused-internal-surveillance-its-workers/4082128002/&quot;&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt; to which you commit will probably be your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people like to know what the future plans are for the person who leaves. I’m not leaving for another job, I’m retiring, which ideally will free up additional time for work in four areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I continue to serve on the board of my local church, and that’s likely to continue for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I’m on the board of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://demvolctr.org/&quot;&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt; of the Santa Clara County Democratic Party that will establish and operate a crucial Bay Area volunteer office in 2020. Since there’s this little thing called an election this year, this is one of those “could expand infinitely to consume all available volunteer hours” roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I hope to have more time to commit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neveragainaction.com/&quot;&gt;Never Again Action&lt;/a&gt;, a direct-action organization working to oppose and shut down the concentration camps in the U.S. This will be as an ally. Feel free to send them a donation – to date, their emails and webinars suggest that they have some savvy people on their national leadership team, and that they understand how to grow and execute strategic nonviolent campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. I also hope to expand my volunteer work for the growing tech labor and tech ethics movement, since that’s obviously an area where I have some domain knowledge and might be able to help out. This growing movement includes established efforts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siliconvalleyrising.org/&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley Rising&lt;/a&gt;, and newer efforts including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://athenaforall.org/&quot;&gt;Athena coalition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ainowinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;AI Now Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the Communications Workers of America’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.code-cwa.org/&quot;&gt;CODE initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Going forward, we’re likely to see even more institutions founded to challenge the growing dangers of tech firms that seek profits over human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 14+ years that I’ve been at Google, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many great people, all of them concerned about doing quality work, all of them concerned with how to make the world a better place. For those who choose to stay, may you continue to find ways to demand what’s right, and refuse what’s wrong. For those who leave, may you take that opportunity to tell your story – why did you leave, was there a broader ethical reason? For those who have left, and those who have never held positions at Google at all, be aware that our power is stronger than we know, because Google can’t force employee policies on us, can’t retaliate against us, can’t fire us. The Google reform movement continues to need people who don’t fear retaliation, and the struggle to reform the company will require participants from both inside and outside the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish all of you the best in your future efforts, wherever they may lead. May we have the courage, the wisdom, the resilience, and the strength to make that future better for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours,&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Hahne&lt;br/&gt;Google, October 2005 – February 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A completely passive solar-powered desalination system developed by researchers at MIT and in China could provide more than 1.5 gallons of fresh drinking water per hour for every square meter of solar collecting area. Such systems could potentially serve off-grid arid coastal areas to provide an efficient, low-cost water source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system uses multiple layers of flat solar evaporators and condensers, lined up in a vertical array and topped with transparent aerogel insulation. It is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ee/c9ee04122b#!divAbstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; appearing today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Energy and Environmental Science&lt;/em&gt;, authored by MIT doctoral students Lenan Zhang and Lin Zhao, postdoc Zhenyuan Xu, professor of mechanical engineering and department head Evelyn Wang, and eight others at MIT and at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the system’s efficiency lies in the way it uses each of the multiple stages to desalinate the water. At each stage, heat released by the previous stage is harnessed instead of wasted. In this way, the team’s demonstration device can achieve an overall efficiency of 385 percent in converting the energy of sunlight into the energy of water evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is essentially a multilayer solar still, with a set of evaporating and condensing components like those used to distill liquor. It uses flat panels to absorb heat and then transfer that heat to a layer of water so that it begins to evaporate. The vapor then condenses on the next panel. That water gets collected, while the heat from the vapor condensation gets passed to the next layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever vapor condenses on a surface, it releases heat; in typical condenser systems, that heat is simply lost to the environment. But in this multilayer evaporator the released heat flows to the next evaporating layer, recycling the solar heat and boosting the overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you condense water, you release energy as heat,” Wang says. “If you have more than one stage, you can take advantage of that heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more layers increases the conversion efficiency for producing potable water, but each layer also adds cost and bulk to the system. The team settled on a 10-stage system for their proof-of-concept device, which was tested on an MIT building rooftop. The system delivered pure water that exceeded city drinking water standards, at a rate of 5.78 liters per square meter (about 1.52 gallons per 11 square feet) of solar collecting area. This is more than two times as much as the record amount previously produced by any such passive solar-powered desalination system, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, with more desalination stages and further optimization, such systems could reach overall efficiency levels as high as 700 or 800 percent, Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some desalination systems, there is no accumulation of salt or concentrated brines to be disposed of. In a free-floating configuration, any salt that accumulates during the day would simply be carried back out at night through the wicking material and back into the seawater, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their demonstration unit was built mostly from inexpensive, readily available materials such as a commercial black solar absorber and paper towels for a capillary wick to carry the water into contact with the solar absorber. In most other attempts to make passive solar desalination systems, the solar absorber material and the wicking material have been a single component, which requires specialized and expensive materials, Wang says. “We’ve been able to decouple these two.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most expensive component of the prototype is a layer of transparent aerogel used as an insulator at the top of the stack, but the team suggests other less expensive insulators could be used as an alternative. (The aerogel itself is made from dirt-cheap silica but requires specialized drying equipment for its manufacture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang emphasizes that the team’s key contribution is a framework for understanding how to optimize such multistage passive systems, which they call thermally localized multistage desalination. The formulas they developed could likely be applied to a variety of materials and device architectures, allowing for further optimization of systems based on different scales of operation or local conditions and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible configuration would be floating panels on a body of saltwater such as an impoundment pond. These could constantly and passively deliver fresh water through pipes to the shore, as long as the sun shines each day. Other systems could be designed to serve a single household, perhaps using a flat panel on a large shallow tank of seawater that is pumped or carried in. The team estimates that a system with a roughly 1-square-meter solar collecting area could meet the daily drinking water needs of one person. In production, they think a system built to serve the needs of a family might be built for around $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan further experiments to continue to optimize the choice of materials and configurations, and to test the durability of the system under realistic conditions. They also will work on translating the design of their lab-scale device into a something that would be suitable for use by consumers. The hope is that it could ultimately play a role in alleviating water scarcity in parts of the developing world where reliable electricity is scarce but seawater and sunlight are abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This new approach is very significant,” says Ravi Prasher, an associate lab director at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and adjunct professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved in this work. “One of the challenges in solar still-based desalination has been low efficiency due to the loss of significant energy in condensation. By efficiently harvesting the condensation energy, the overall solar to vapor efficiency is dramatically improved. … This increased efficiency will have an overall impact on reducing the cost of produced water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team included Bangjun Li, Chenxi Wang and Ruzhu Wang at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Bikram Bhatia, Kyle Wilke, Youngsup Song, Omar Labban, and John Lienhard, who is the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Water at MIT. The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, and the MIT Tata Center for Technology and Design.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python dicts are now ordered</title>
<link>https://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2020/02/05/dicts-ordered/en/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2020/02/05/dicts-ordered/en/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There were several moments over the last few weeks when I heard people discuss differences between Python &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list&quot;&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict&quot;&gt;dicts&lt;/a&gt; and one of the first ones mentioned was that lists are ordered and dicts are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not anymore. Quoting the docs referenced above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order. This behavior was an implementation detail of CPython from 3.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to discuss &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; differences you can pretty much only point out that dict values are accessible by keys, which could be of any immutable type, while list values are indexed with integers. That's it :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How and why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plain hash table holds both keys and values in a pseudo random order determined by hashes calculated from keys. It is also sparse, with unoccupied holes in a pre-allocated array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://softwaremaniacs.org/media/blog/hash-table.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since version 3.6 CPython holds keys and values in a separate dense array, while the hash table itself only holds &lt;em&gt;indexes&lt;/em&gt; into that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://softwaremaniacs.org/media/blog/hash-entries.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the entries array is populated sequentially, it naturally ensures the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know the initial reason for this change was saving space by sharing hash tables of multiple dicts with the same set of keys (which in Python means instances of the same class, for example). I don't know the exact politics of how this useful property progressed from an implementation detail to a guaranteed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;dict[int] vs. list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it mean that a dict with int keys is the same as list? There's still a few practical differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious difference is the API. You'd have to always mention indexes explicitly when working with a dict[int], there's no such thing as &lt;code&gt;.append(value)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.pop()&lt;/code&gt; with no argument. Frankly, I can't see any point in trying to make it work :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, dicts are bigger, by an order of magnitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;In [79]: getsizeof(['' for i in range(100000)])
Out[79]: 824472

In [80]: getsizeof({i: '' for i in range(100000)})
Out[80]: 5242984
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I couldn't find any consistent difference in speed in neither insertion of new values in a list and a dict[int], nor in traversing them. My gut feeling tells me it's mostly due to the fact that a hash value of an int is the int itself, so there's no time wasted on hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not sets though!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, to my surprise sets are still unordered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;In [3]: list({'one': True, 'two': True, 'three': True, 'four': True, 'five': True})
Out[3]: ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']

In [4]: list({'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'})
Out[4]: ['three', 'five', 'four', 'one', 'two']
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this moment I thought of sets as basically thin wrappers around actual dicts operating on their keys and neglecting values. Turns out, they have their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MacBook 16-inch Fan Noise (2019)</title>
<link>https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250878229</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250878229</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are kind of wrapping up all our testing and working with the Apple Business Team to figure out how we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thread is getting a little side tracked with monitors and so I wanted to point out that these issues discussed are completely unrelated to brand/model of monitors being used. That said, it IS related to having monitors connected and the internal GPU within the MacBook, along with the CPU and the overall heat that both generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our final testings, we did clean installs with 10.15.2 and primarily tested an eGPU using a Razor Core and a Radeon RX Vega 64 so we could eliminate the internal GPU in the MBP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became really clear the combined heat from the internal Radeon Pro 5500m GPU and the i9-9880G CPU is too much for the current thermal management system, especially when using all USB-C ports. (I.e., for power, USB-C hub, USB-C to Display Port video cables).  From all the testing and heat generated by the unit, it looks like our Radeon Pro 5500m GPU is fried because we are seeing artifacts on text (laptop display and external monitors) but not when we use the eGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you understand our configuration with the eGPU:  We have one USB-C Hub connected to the MBP and one USB-C cable connected to the eGPU.  The one USB-C cable to the eGPU is powering the MBP but also the eGPU has the two Display Port cable to the monitors.  Now the MBP has two free USB-C ports.  This was producing about 38 degrees less heat in Airflow on the MBP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the eGPU is connected, we can push the MBP to about 60% CPU for sustained periods before hearing the fans at about 4500 RPM. But as many of us have noticed, when we don’t have an eGPU, we’re seeing this at 5% to 10% CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have installed Parallels and ran Windows 10 on three monitors on separate space and have done Geekbench tests and a variety of stress tests with the eGPU and its operating normally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, the combination of using the GPU and CPU is pushing the MBP into heat conditions causing the FAN issues and in our case, possibly damage to the GPU.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple had a similar issue with the 2018 MacBook Pro and people were starting to stick their machines inside a Freezer to see if they could avoid the CPU’s from stepping down prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully Apple can find a solution because these new 16 inch MBP could be incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please start a support case with Apple so we can get this resolved sooner than later and it will also protect you a bit more if you need to return your units beyond the return policy. Moving forward, its all on Apple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim&lt;/p&gt;

<title>95th percentile isn&amp;#039;t that hard to reach</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;95%-ile isn't that good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching 95%-ile isn't very impressive because it's not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn't help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it's just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I'm also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_weird_trick_advertisements&quot;&gt;one weird trick&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to refer to specifics since &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926493613097439232&quot;&gt;the discussions I've seen about this are all in the abstract&lt;/a&gt;, which turns them into Rorschach tests. For example, Scott Adams has a widely cited post claiming that it's better to be a generalist than a specialist because, to become &quot;extraordinary&quot;, you have to either be &quot;the best&quot; at one thing or 75%-ile at two things. If that were strictly true, it would surely be better to be a generalist, but that's of course exaggeration and it's possible to get a lot of value out of a specialized skill without being &quot;the best&quot;; since the precise claim, as written, is obviously silly and the rest of the post is vague handwaving, discussions will inevitably devolve into people stating their prior beliefs and basically ignoring the content of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, in every activity I've participated in where it's possible to get a rough percentile ranking, people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct. &quot;Real world&quot; activities typically can't be reduced to a percentile rating, but achieving what appears to be a similar level of proficiency seems similarly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start by looking at Overwatch (a video game) in detail because it's an activity I'm familiar with where it's easy to get ranking information and observe what's happening, and then we'll look at some &quot;real world&quot; examples where we can observe the same phenomena, although we won't be able to get ranking information for real world examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;overwatch&quot;&gt;Overwatch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 90%-ile and 95%-ile ranks in Overwatch, the vast majority of players will pretty much constantly make basic game losing mistakes. These are simple mistakes like standing next to the objective instead of on top of the objective while the match timer runs out, turning a probable victory into a certain defeat. See the attached footnote if you want enough detail about specific mistakes that you can decide for yourself if a mistake is &quot;basic&quot; or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons we might expect this to happen are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People don't want to win or don't care about winning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People understand their mistakes but haven't put in enough time to fix them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are untalented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don't understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Overwatch, you may see a lot of (1), people who don’t seem to care about winning, at lower ranks, but by the time you get to 30%-ile, it's common to see people indicate their desire to win in various ways, such as yelling at players who are perceived as uncaring about victory or unskilled, complaining about people who they perceive to make mistakes that prevented their team from winning, etc.. Other than the occasional troll, it's not unreasonable to think that people are generally trying to win when they're severely angered by losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2), not having put in time enough to fix their mistakes will, at some point, apply to all players who are improving, but if you look at the median time played at 50%-ile, people who are stably ranked there have put in hundreds of hours (and the median time played at higher ranks is higher). Given how simple the mistakes we're discussing are, not having put in enough time cannot be the case for most players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common complaint among low-ranked Overwatch players in Overwatch forums is that they're just not talented and can never get better. Most people probably don't have the talent to play in a professional league regardless of their practice regimen, but when you can get to 95%-ile by fixing mistakes like &quot;not realizing that you should stand on the objective&quot;, you don't really need a lot of talent to get to 95%-ile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While (4), people not understanding how to spot and fix their mistakes, isn't the only other possible explanation, I believe it's the most likely explanation for most players. Most players who express frustration that they're stuck at a rank up to maybe 95%-ile or 99%-ile don't seem to realize that they could drastically improve by observing their own gameplay or having someone else look at their gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that's curious about this is that Overwatch makes it easy to spot basic mistakes (compared to most other activities). After you're killed, the game shows you how you died from the viewpoint of the player who killed you, allowing you to see what led to your death. Overwatch also records the entire game and lets you watch a replay of the game, allowing you to figure out what happened and why the game was won or lost. In many other games, you'd have to set up recording software to be able to view a replay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read Overwatch forums, you'll see a regular stream of posts that are basically &quot;I'm SOOOOOO FRUSTRATED! I've played this game for 1200 hours and I'm still ranked 10%-ile, [some Overwatch specific stuff that will vary from player to player]&quot;. Another user will inevitably respond with something like &quot;we can't tell what's wrong from your text, please post a video of your gameplay&quot;. In the cases where the original poster responds with a recording of their play, people will post helpful feedback that will immediately make the player much better if they take it seriously. If you follow these people who ask for help, you'll often see them ask for feedback at a much higher rank (e.g., moving from 10%-ile to 40%-ile) shortly afterwards. It's nice to see that the advice works, but it's unfortunate that so many players don't realize that watching their own recordings or posting recordings for feedback could have saved 1198 hours of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to be common for Overwatch players (well into 95%-ile and above) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not get feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imaprove slowly when getting feedback would make improving quickly easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overwatch provides the tools to make it relatively easy to get feedback, but people who very strongly express a desire to improve don't avail themselves of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-life&quot;&gt;Real life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience is that other games are similar and I think that &quot;real life&quot; activities aren't so different, although there are some complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games with rating systems are easy to optimize for: your meta-goal can be to get a high rating, which can typically be achieved by increasing your win rate by fixing the kinds of mistakes described above, like not realizing that you should step onto the objective. For any particular mistake, you can even make a reasonable guess at the impact on your win rate and therefore the impact on your rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, if you want to be (for example) &quot;a good speaker&quot;, that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it's unclear what that means with respect to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what's effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you're trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice. For example, if you want to be 99%-ile in a trick-taking card game like bridge or spades (among all players, not subgroups like &quot;ACBL players with masterpoints&quot; or &quot;people who regularly attend North American Bridge Championships&quot;), you can do this by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of “a good speaker” in mind, there still isn't an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it's easy to improve in percentile terms since relatively few people are trying to improve at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. Just for example, if you're a local table tennis hotshot who can beat every rando at a local bar, when you challenge someone to a game and they say &quot;sure, what's your rating?&quot; you know you're in shellacking by someone who can probably beat you while playing with a shoe brush. You're probably 99%-ile, but someone with no talent who's put in the time to practice the basics is going to have a serve that you can't return as well as be able to kill any shot a local bar expert is able to consitently hit. In most real life activities, there's almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a couple of concrete examples, I helped &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.leahhanson.us/speaking.html&quot;&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; prepare for talks from 2013 to 2017. The first couple practice talks she gave were about the same as you'd expect if you walked into a random talk at a large tech conference. For the first couple years she was speaking, she did something like 30 or so practice runs for each public talk, of which I watched and gave feedback on half. Her first public talk was (IMO) well above average for a talk at a large, well regarded, tech conference and her talks got better from there until she stopped speaking in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed above, this is more subjective than game ratings and there's no way to really determine a percentile, but if you look at how most people prepare for talks, it's not too surprising that Leah was above average. At one of the first conferences she spoke at, the night before the conference, we talked to another speaker who mentioned that they hadn't finished their talk yet and only had fifteen minutes of material (for a forty minute talk). They were trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the time. That kind of preparation isn't unusual and the vast majority of talks prepared like that aren't great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you're giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that's 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it's not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've studied pedagogy, you might say that the help I gave to Leah was incredibly lame. It's known that having laypeople try to figure out how to improve among themselves is among the worst possible ways to learn something, good instruction is more effective and having a skilled coach or teacher give one-on-one instruction is more effective still. That's 100% true, my help was incredibly lame. However, most people aren't going to practice a talk more than a couple times and many won't even practice a single time (I don't have great data proving this, this is from informally polling speakers at conferences I've attended). This makes Leah's 30 practice runs an extraordinary amount of practice compared to most speakers, which resulted in a relatively good outcome even though we were using one of the worst possible techniques for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing is another example. I'm not going to compare myself to anyone else, but my writing improved dramatically the first couple of years I wrote this blog just because I spent a little bit of effort on getting and taking feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah read one or two drafts of almost every post and gave me feedback. On the first posts, since neither one of us knew anything about writing, we had a hard time identifying what was wrong. If I had some awkward prose or confusing narrative structure, we'd be able to point at it and say &quot;that looks wrong&quot; without being able to describe what was wrong or suggest a fix. It was like, in the era before spellcheck, when you misspelled a word and could tell that something was wrong, but every permutation you came up with was just as wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fix for that was to hire a professional editor whose writing I respected with the instructions &quot;I don't care about spelling and grammar fixes, there are fundamental problems with my writing that I don't understand, please explain to me what they are&quot;. I think this was more effective than my helping Leah with talks because we got someone who's basically a professional coach involved. An example of something my editor helped us with was giving us a vocabulary we could use to discuss structural problems, the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GPPmYE&quot;&gt;design patterns&lt;/a&gt; gave people a vocabulary to talk about OO design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-this-blog-s-regularly-scheduled-topic-programming&quot;&gt;Back to this blog's regularly scheduled topic: programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming is similar to the real life examples above in that it's impossible to assign a rating or calculate percentiles or anything like that, but it is still possible to make significant improvements relative to your former self without too much effort by getting feedback on what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926492239081197569&quot;&gt;here's one thing Michael Malis did&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One incredibly useful exercise I’ve found is to watch myself program. Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. Usually I will watch the times that felt like it took a lot longer to complete some task than it should have. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, previously when writing code, I would write all my code for a new feature up front and then test all of the code collectively. When testing code this way, I would have to isolate which function the bug was in and then debug that individual function. After watching a recording of myself writing code, I realized I was spending about a quarter of the total time implementing the feature tracking down which functions the bugs were in! This was completely non-obvious to me and I wouldn’t have found it out without recording myself. Now that I’m aware that I spent so much time isolating which function a bugs are in, I now test each function as I write it to make sure they work. This allows me to write code a lot faster as it dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to debug my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've spent time figuring out where time is going when I code and basically saw the same thing as in Overwatch, except instead of constantly making game-losing mistakes, I was constantly doing pointlessly time-losing things. Just getting rid of some of those bad habits has probably been at least a 2x productivity increase for me, pretty easy to measure since fixing these is basically just clawing back wasted time. For example, I noticed how I'd get distracted for N minutes if I read something on the internet when I needed to wait for two minutes, so I made sure to keep a queue of useful work to fill dead time (and if I was working on something very latency sensitive where I didn't want to task switch, I'd do nothing until I was done waiting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note here is that it's important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different. It would generally be considered absurd to operate a complex software system without metrics or tracing, but it's normal to operate yourself without metrics or tracing, even though you're much more complex and harder to understand than the software you work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/hn-comments/#what-makes-engineers-productive-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-5496914&quot;&gt;Jonathan Tang has noted that choosing the right problem dominates execution speed&lt;/a&gt;. I don't disagree with that, but doubling execution speed is still decent win that's independent of selecting the right problem to work on and I don't think that discussing how to choose the right problem can be effectively described in the abstract and the context necessary to give examples would be much longer than the already too long Overwatch examples in this post, maybe I'll write another post that's just about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I've lived recently (NYC &amp;amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn't have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for games like Overwatch, I don't think improving is a moral imperative; there's nothing wrong with having fun at 50%-ile or 10%-ile or any rank. But in every game I've played with a rating and/or league/tournament system, a lot of people get really upset and unhappy when they lose even when they haven't put much effort into improving. If that's the case, why not put a little bit of effort into improving and spend a little bit less time being upset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-meta-techniques-for-improving&quot;&gt;Some meta-techniques for improving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get feedback and practice
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideally from an expert coach but, if not, this can be from a layperson or even yourself (if you have some way of recording/tracing what you're doing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guided exercises or exercises with solutions
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is very easy to find in books for &quot;old&quot; games, like chess or Bridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For particular areas, you can often find series of books that have these, e.g., in math, books in the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) tend to have problems with solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-other-most-ridiculable-ideas&quot;&gt;Appendix: other most ridiculable ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the ideas I've posted about that were the most widely ridiculed at the time of the post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My posts on compensation have the dubious distinction of being the posts most frequently called out both for being so obvious that they're pointless as well as for being laughably wrong. I suspect they're also the posts that have had the largest aggregate impact on people -- I've had a double digit number of people tell me one of the compensation posts changed their life and they now make $x00,000/yr more than they used to because they know it's possible to get a much higher paying job and I doubt that I even hear from 10% of the people who make a big change as a result of learning that it's possible to make a lot more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote my first post on compensation, in 2015, I got ridiculed more for writing something obviously wrong than for writing something obvious, but the last few years things have flipped around. I still get the occasional bit of ridicule for being wrong when some corner of Twitter or a web forum that's well outside the HN/reddit bubble runs across my post, but the ratio of “obviously wrong” to “obvious” has probably gone from 20:1 to 1:5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions on monorepos have also seen a similar change since 2015. Outside of some folks at big companies, monorepos used to be considered obviously stupid among people who keep up with trends, but this has really changed. Not as much as opinions on compensation, but enough that I'm now a little surprised when I meet a hardline anti-monorepo-er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's taken longer for opinions to come around on CPU bugs, that's probably the post that now gets the least ridicule from the list above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That markets don't eliminate all discrimination is the one where opinions have come around the least. Hardline &quot;all markets are efficient&quot; folks aren't really convinced by academic work like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2Or7Z9k&quot;&gt;Becker's The Economics of Discrimination&lt;/a&gt; or summaries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/&quot;&gt;the evidence laid out in the post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts on computers having higher latency and the lack of empirical evidence of the benefit of types are the posts I've seen pointed to the most often to defend a ridicuable opinion. I didn't know when I started doing the work for either post and they both happen to have turned up evidence that's the opposite of the most common loud claims (there's very good evidence that advanced type systems improve safety in practice and of course computers are faster in every way, people who think they're slower are just indulging in nostalgia). I don't know if this has changed many opinion. However, I haven't gotten much direct ridicule for either post even though both posts directly state a position I see commonly ridiculed online. I suspect that's partially because both posts are empirical, so there's not much to dispute (though the post on discrimnation is also empirical, but it still gets its share of ridicule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last idea in the list is more meta: no one directly tells me that I should use more obscure terminology. Instead, I get comments that I must not know much about X because I'm not using terms of art. Using terms of art is a common way to establish credibility or authority, but that's something I don't really believe in. Arguing from authority doesn't tell you anything; adding needless terminology just makes things more difficult for readers who aren't in the field and are reading because they're interested in the topic but don't want to actually get into the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty fundamental disagreement that I have with a lot of people. Just for example, I recently got into a discussion with an authority who insisted that it wasn't possible for me to reasonably disagree with them (I suggested we agree to disagree) because they're an authority on the topic and I'm not. It happens that I worked on the formal verification of a system very similar to the system we were discussing, but I didn't mention that because I don't believe that my status as an authority on the topic matters. If someone has such a weak argument that they have to fall back on an infallible authority, that's usually a sign that they don't have a well-reasoned defense of their position. This goes double when they point to themselves as the infallible authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have about 20 other posts on stupid sounding ideas queued up in my head, but I mostly try to avoid writing things that are controversial, so I don't know that I'll write many of those up. If I were to write one post a month (much more frequently than my recent rate) and limit myself to 10% posts on ridiculable ideas, it would take 16 years to write up all of the ridiculable ideas I currently have.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Critical Bluetooth vulnerability in Android</title>
<link>https://insinuator.net/2020/02/critical-bluetooth-vulnerability-in-android-cve-2020-0022/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://insinuator.net/2020/02/critical-bluetooth-vulnerability-in-android-cve-2020-0022/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On November 3rd, 2019, we have reported a critical vulnerability affecting the Android Bluetooth subsystem. This vulnerability has been assigned &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0022&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-0022&lt;/a&gt; and was now patched in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-02-01.html&quot;&gt;latest security patch&lt;/a&gt; from February 2020.&lt;span id=&quot;more-12426&quot;/&gt; The security impact is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Android 8.0 to 9.0, a remote attacker within proximity can silently execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Bluetooth daemon as long as Bluetooth is enabled. No user interaction is required and only the Bluetooth MAC address of the target devices has to be known. For some devices, the Bluetooth MAC address can be deduced from the WiFi MAC address. This vulnerability can lead to theft of personal data and could potentially be used to spread malware (Short-Distance Worm).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Android 10, this vulnerability is not exploitable for technical reasons and only results in a crash of the Bluetooth daemon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android versions even older than 8.0 might also be affected but we have not evaluated the impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are strongly advised to install the latest available security patch from February 2020. If you have no patch available yet or your device is not supported anymore, you can try to mitigate the impact by some generic behavior rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only enable Bluetooth if strictly necessary. Keep in mind that most Bluetooth enabled headphones also support wired analog audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your device non-discoverable. Most are only discoverable if you enter the Bluetooth scanning menu. Nevertheless, some older phones might be discoverable permanently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as we are confident that patches have reached the end users, we will publish a technical report on this vulnerability including a description of the exploit as well as Proof of Concept code.&lt;/p&gt;
