<title>At $75K, housing a prisoner in California now costs more than a year at Harvard</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-prison-costs-20170604-htmlstory.html</link>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of imprisoning each of California’s 130,000 inmates is expected to reach a record $75,560 in the next year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;diamondy&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.trbimg.com/img-5681c657/turbine/la-me-san-quentin-death-row-20151106-pg-003/750/750x422&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt; A guard watches prisoners being escorted across the yard at San Quentin State Prison. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;benton-title timeline-title&quot;&gt;More than tuition at Harvard University&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s enough to cover the annual cost of attending Harvard University and still have plenty left over for pizza and beer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 includes a record $11.4 billion for the corrections department while also predicting that there will be 11,500 fewer inmates in four years because voters in November approved earlier releases for many inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e627e9/turbine/la-me-solitary-confinement-prison-pictures-007/800/800x450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt; California State Prison in Corcoran. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date-title&quot;&gt;A PATTERN CONTINUES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;benton-title timeline-title&quot;&gt;Cost per prisoner has doubled since 2005&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price for each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders related to overcrowding have reduced the population by about one-quarter. Salaries and benefits for prison guards and medical providers drove much of the increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a per-inmate cost that is the nation’s highest — and $2,000 above tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses to attend Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, California’s per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say with fewer inmates, the costs should be falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’re incarcerating less, we haven’t ramped the system back down,” said Chris Hoene, executive director of the left-leaning California Budget &amp;amp; Policy Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the corrections department has one employee for every two inmates, compared with one employee for roughly every four inmates in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date-title&quot;&gt;why does it cost so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;benton-title timeline-title&quot;&gt;Costs rising even as prison population declines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California was sued over prison overcrowding, and to comply with a federal court-imposed population cap, the Brown administration now keeps most lower-level offenders in county jails instead of state prisons. Additionally, voters in 2014 reduced penalties for drug and property crimes and last fall approved the earlier releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) said reformers falsely promised a “prison dividend” from savings related to the changes. Instead, there’s now an uptick in many crimes and he’s worried it will lead to an influx of new inmates that will cost more to house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Petersilia, co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, said it was “highly predictable” that per-inmate costs would increase even as the population decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We released all the low-risk, kind of low-need, and we kept in the high-risk, high-need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quake II RTX: Re-Engineering a Classic with Ray Tracing Effects on Vulkan</title>
<link>https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/quake-ii-rtx-ray-tracing-vulkan-vkray-geforce-rtx/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/quake-ii-rtx-ray-tracing-vulkan-vkray-geforce-rtx/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;id Software’s &lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt; launched in 1997, bringing gamers a new single-player campaign, a long-awaited, addictive multiplayer mode that we played for years on pitifully-slow 56K modems, and a jaw-dropping engine that supported 3DFX GPU acceleration out of the box. Colored lighting, dynamic visual effects, and much more, all running at a glorious 640x480, or perhaps 800x600 if you had top-of-the-line hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2001, when id Software made the &lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt; engine &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-2&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, enabling anyone to legally release total conversions with complete engine overhauls. Ever since, fans have beavered away on their own personal projects, the latest of which is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/&quot;&gt;Q2VKPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released in January, &lt;em&gt;Q2VKPT&lt;/em&gt; was created by former NVIDIA intern Christoph Schied, a Ph.D. student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. The “PT” in its name stands for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chunky.llbit.se/path_tracing.html&quot;&gt;Path Tracing&lt;/a&gt;, a compute-intensive ray tracing technique that unifies all lighting effects (shadows, reflections, et cetera) into a single ‘pure ray tracing algorithm’. With Ray Tracing being all the rage, word of a developer making a beautiful, real-time ray-traced version of &lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt; made headlines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But path tracing has a downside: its random sampling algorithm introduces ‘noise’ that makes gameplay appear grainy and speckled, as seen in 2016’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amietia.com/q2pt.html&quot;&gt;Q2PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. To solve the problem, Christoph and his university colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/&quot;&gt;built upon&lt;/a&gt; ideas originally conceived in 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_Spatiotemporal-Variance-Guided-Filtering%3A&quot;&gt;during his NVIDIA internship&lt;/a&gt;, when he co-invented a fast way to remove said graininess by combining the results of multiple game frames, in a manner similar to that used by Temporal Anti-Aliasing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ad Fraud Scheme Drained Users’ Batteries By Running Hidden Video Ads In Android</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/in-banner-video-ad-fraud</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/in-banner-video-ad-fraud</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;95.065032987747&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julien is an independent developer&lt;/strong&gt; who built and maintains one of the most popular audio apps in the Google Play store. With millions of downloads and hundreds of thousands of positive reviews, he’s obsessive about responding to user complaints and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He often receives emails from users complaining that his app is draining their battery and using more data than expected. Usually, it’s because they set the app to download files when they’re not on Wi-Fi. But sometimes it’s due to ad fraudsters taking advantage of his app to run hidden, data-hungry video ads behind the legitimate banners he sells to earn his living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julien's app is one of several, including many using Twitter's MoPub ad platform, that saw its in-app ads hijacked in an ad fraud scheme uncovered by fraud detection firm Protected Media. The company’s findings, along with additional reporting and interviews by BuzzFeed News, and independent verification from an outside ad fraud lab, show that one of the players implicated in this scheme is Aniview, an Israeli company with offices in New York that runs a video ad technology platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aniview denies any involvement and instead says the platform and banner ads and code, which were created by one of its subsidiaries, were exploited by a malicious, unnamed third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BuzzFeed brought to our attention that there is an abuse activity, as an immediate action, we stopped this activity and started and continue an internal incident review,” said Aniview CEO Alon Carmel in an emailed statement. “We notified and emphasized our clients that the use of our platform must be according to our policy and the IAB and TAG guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just one of the many ways ad fraudsters siphon money out of the global digital advertising industry, which will see &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/daily-hourly-fight-digital-ad-fraud-worse-ever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than $20 billion&lt;/a&gt; stolen this year. This scheme in particular highlights &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/ad-industry-insiders-are-connected-to-a-fraud-scheme-that&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; how ad tech companies exploit insider access and technical knowledge to participate in ad fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t even think about me being ripped off,” Julien told BuzzFeed News. “All I think about is them damaging the app’s reputation. It can cost money to [a user] and drain his battery. This is the thing that makes me really mad.” (BuzzFeed News agreed to withhold his full name and the name of his app due to concerns about people wrongly thinking it was knowingly part of the scheme.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the scheme works. Julien sells a banner ad, which appears in the app and is visible to his users. Then, hidden from view behind that banner, fraudsters conceal autoplaying video ads that no human being actually sees, but which register as having been served and viewed. In this scenario, Julien gets paid for the small banner ad in his app that users see, but the fraudsters earn many times that amount by stuffing far more lucrative video ads behind the banner. Ultimately, it’s the brands whose ads were shown in hidden video players that lose money to those running the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fraudsters are purchasing cheap in-app display inventory and are filling it with multiple video players behind innocuous fake branded display ads,” said Asaf Greiner, the CEO of Protected Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;61.301123595506&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of ad fraud is known in the industry as in-banner video ads, and has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://videoadnews.com/2018/03/22/mcdonalds-the-latest-to-fall-victim-of-ad-fraud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Greiner’s team identified a new version of it last fall and said in total they’ve seen tens of millions of dollars' worth of fraudulent video ads running per month as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad fraud lab run by DoubleVerify, a digital measurement company, identified the same in-banner video ad fraud scheme at the end of last year, according to Roy Rosenfeld, the company’s VP of product management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told BuzzFeed News the fraudsters “did a very good job at hiding and obfuscating what they were doing” and were “quite sophisticated in the thinking behind how they can monetize that [video] inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleVerify saw at least 60 million ad calls being made for fraudulent video ads per month, though Rosenfeld noted that not all of those ad slots were filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aniview and its subsidiary, OutStream Media, were identified by Protected Media as being part of the scheme after the fraud detection firm gathered and analyzed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59jK66Ut8tY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video evidence&lt;/a&gt;, code, and other information during an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenfeld said DoubleVerify’s investigation identified that “the Aniview player was heavily driving” the fraudulent video ad activity. He said his team identified the same code and other materials as Protected Media had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmel, of Aniview, told BuzzFeed News that his company “does not knowingly engage in any fraudulent activity” and said his team has been trying to stop this activity on their platform since they were first contact by Protected Media last month. He acknowledged that OutStream Media, the company identified by Protected Media, is a subsidiary of Aniview. But he said it had ceased operations last summer and that Aniview is in the process of legally shutting it down. He said the ad fraud documented by Protected Media and DoubleVerify was done by bad actors using the Aniview video ad platform, as well as images and code created by OutStream Media, in an unauthorized way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be crystal clear, another customer on Aniview’s [self-serve] platform used this [video ad] player and is responsible for this activity and we took actions immediately to stop this activity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fighting against bad activities, pushing and focus on clean and legit activities and should not be blamed or framed for bad use of our platform.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;157&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmel could not say who this bad actor was or how they managed to gain access to content that was uploaded to an OutStream Media account on Aniview’s platform. He declined to identify the malicious actors, or to share any details about them. He also acknowledged removing the photos and names of people, including his cofounder, Tal Melenboim, from Aniview’s website after being contacted by BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the removed employees had leadership roles with OutStream Media in addition to their work at Aniview. Carmel, who previously cofounded the popular Jewish dating site Jdate, said they left the company to pursue other interests at the end of last year, and he neglected to remove them from the Aniview team page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmel was provided with a copy of the malicious code used to place the banner ads and hidden video players. In addition to using the Aniview platform and banner ads from OutStream Media’s account on it, this code included the URL shoval.tv as a tracking pixel to gather data on ad performance. Shoval.tv is a domain name owned by Aniview cofounder Tal Melenboim. In an email to BuzzFeed News, Melenboim denied any involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmel said the fraudsters must have copied the part of the code that included Shoval.tv from an earlier OutStream demo, and said Shoval.tv is commonly used as a tracking URL by Aniview. The inclusion of this code means that only a person with access to shoval.tv would be able to track the performance of the fraudulent ads carrying this pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected Media also found that a significant portion of the banner ads purchased for this scheme were bought using MoPub, the mobile ad network owned by Twitter. This does not mean MoPub was engaged in the scheme. But it does mean Twitter’s ad platform was exploited for months by fraudsters, and it earned commission on the ads bought using its tools. (Julien uses MoPub to help place ads in his app and says the company is responsive when he reports bad ads.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At this time, we can confirm that the suspicious activity in question is not being initiated by MoPub,” a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “The activity observed by Protected Media stems from an ad that is initiating other non-viewable video ads to run in the background. We are currently investigating what the potential sources of the issue could be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scheme illustrates one of the central challenges in reducing the massive, multibillion-dollar fraud problem in digital advertising: Nearly every player in the supply chain, except for the brands who spend money on ads, profits from fraudulent ad delivery. Even if they’re not involved in ad fraud, platforms such as ad networks and other intermediaries earn a share of the money spent on invalid ads. This creates a disincentive to stop fraud from taking place, according to Greiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an unfair kind of situation because anybody who behaves well and doesn’t allow this on their platform is being left out of the profit,” he said, adding that “there’s very little penalty and there’s a lot to gain — the numbers are just enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected Media first&lt;/strong&gt; detected the use of hidden video ads in October. Though not a new ad fraud technique, the company saw this iteration grow large enough that it warranted a closer look. After seeing which video players were being used to run the hidden ads, and which ad networks the fraudsters were buying the display ad from, Protected Media reached out to the relevant parties, including Aniview, last month. (Rosenfeld of DoubleVerify said it also identified the scheme late last year and began blocking it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected Media provided BuzzFeed News with video documentation of invalid video ads running behind banners that were created by OutStream Media, Aniview’s subsidiary. These video ads were served using Aniview’s platform and the banner ads were hosted on Aniview’s website with an account in OutStream Media’s name. This demonstrates a direct link between OutStream Media and the banners that were placed in apps such as Julien’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected Media also identified that the shoval.tv domain name owned by Aniview cofounder Tal Melenboim was used to track the performance of the fraudulent ads, adding yet another link to Aniview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that information, Greiner believes “Aniview is the group who left no room for deniability — the others can claim ignorance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After BuzzFeed News first contacted Aniview, the company removed the LinkedIn page for OutStream Media, and deleted people from the Aniview team page on its website. Two of the removed people were Melenboim, who had previously listed himself as the founder and CEO of OutStream Media on his LinkedIn, and his wife Mazal Melenboim, whose LinkedIn lists her as the head of media operations for Aniview and the head of operations for OutStream Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmel said the couple left Aniview at the end of last year and praised Tal Melenboim as a “reputable professional” who was “an asset to Aniview during his many years of employment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tal Melenboim told BuzzFeed News in an email that he and his wife are not involved in any illegal activity. “It is important for me to point out to you, that if you got the impression that Aniview/Outstream Media or someone from our team, including me or my wife, is involved in an act of not legit activity, it is simply far away from the true.” (Melenboim said that Carmel’s English is better than his, and that as a result specific questions should be directed to him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmel said the Melenboims were removed from the company website at his direction after being contacted by BuzzFeed News, and said it was an oversight that they were still on the site. He offered to provide a letter from the company’s legal counsel to testify to the fact that the Melenboims had not worked at Aniview since the end of last year. He also said other employees were removed from the company’s team page at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After BuzzFeed News emailed Carmel two links that showed the scheme was still active on his platform, the activity was quickly shut off. He said that was a result of his company being given the information necessary to shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the links BuzzFeed News provided to Carmel went to a page at play.aniview.com/outstreammedia/ that hosted the banner ads used in the scheme. These banners were generic images for companies and products such as Coca-Cola, M&amp;amp;M's, McDonald’s, and Disney. If a user clicked on them they were taken to the homepage of the Google Play Store, showing that they were not real ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;72&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmel said these images belonged to OutStream Media and were created as test images when the company was operational last year. He said someone used these images without permission to execute the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The banners were ONLY used for reach media demos of outstream units,” he said in an email. “After seeing in your email that someone used our banner without our permission we removed it from our server. Thank you for pointing it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what Carmel claims is that an unknown bad actor created an account on his platform, and then used banner ad images created by his subsidiary to execute the fraud scheme. He declined to share information about the bad actor’s account, citing legal concerns. He also couldn’t say exactly how this actor knew about banner ads uploaded to the account of OutStream Media — a company Carmel says was only briefly operational last year. He suggested one of the organizations OutStream had previously tried to pitch its services to was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The demo page of Outstream units was public and as well have been sent to many potential customers (BTW, one of them was Buzzfeed),” he said in an email. Carmel did not provide contact information for the person at BuzzFeed he says received the OutStream pitch. He did provide screenshots of email templates that were sent to prospective clients in May of last year that included a link to a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmel says the same bad actor must have copied the OutStream tracking code that included shoval.tv, the domain owned by Melenboim. This means the fraudsters were sophisticated enough to set up and manage the scheme, but would have left in a tracking pixel that prevents them from receiving performance data on their ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greiner of Protected Media said several ad tech companies engaged in or facilitated this form of fraud. Aniview was the one they gathered the most convincing evidence about. Others continue to run the scheme after being contacted by Protected Media, and in at least one case an executive from an involved company even complained about being called out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of them spoke to my VP of sales and said everybody does it, why are we picking on them,” Greiner said. “It’s something we hear too often, unfortunately.” ●&lt;/p&gt;

<title>So you want your app/website to work in China</title>
<link>https://chanind.github.io/china/2019/01/19/launching-an-app-or-website-in-china.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://chanind.github.io/china/2019/01/19/launching-an-app-or-website-in-china.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Wait, what do you mean make my app/site &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; in China? I don’t have to do anything to make my app work in the US or Singapore or Kenya or anywhere else, and I didn’t make the Chinese government angry, so it should just work in China, right? Sadly, it’s not so simple. If your app/website servers aren’t hosted from within China, then, for all intents and purposes, it’s blocked. I mean, it will probably technically load, but will be excruciatingly, unusably slow. And sometimes it will just not load at all for hours at a time. This is true for all services hosted outside of the firewall, even in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-firewall&quot;&gt;The Firewall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any time a request needs to go from within China to the outside world, or from the outside world into China, the request crosses the Chinese Great Firewall. When this happens, there’s a lot of latency that gets added, and there’s a high chance the request will randomly fail. Requests through the firewall may appear to work most of the time, but then suddenly get fully blocked for several hours. The firewall doesn’t seem like it’s implemented uniformly across China either, so it’s possible that if you test in Shanghai your request may go through but a user in Changsha will have their requests blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if requests need to pass through the firewall to reach your servers outside of China you’re in for a bad time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;icp-license&quot;&gt;ICP License&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have any infrastructure working in China, you need to apply for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICP_license&quot;&gt;ICP license&lt;/a&gt; from the Chinese government. All the techniques below require that you have this license. It’s quite a pain to apply for, and takes several months, but there’s no way around it. You can find more info about registering for an ICP license &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/chinese-icp-licensing-what-why-and-how-to-get-hosted-in-china--cms-23193&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Alicloud also has a lot of info on registering for an ICP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibabacloud.com/icp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-1-cloudflare-china-acceleration&quot;&gt;Option 1: Cloudflare China Acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest option to get your services working in China is to go use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/network/china/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s China acceleration&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare partnered with Baidu to extend their acceleration network with points inside of China itself. Going through this method allows requests into and out of China to bypass the firewall, so your service will be fast. Cloudflare China acceleration requires an enterprise account though, so it’s going to be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Cloudflare does effectively allow you to host your infrastructure outside of China, but depending on your business it might not be entirely legal. That’s because China has strict &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/05/china-data-protection-regulations-cdpr.html&quot;&gt;data protection laws&lt;/a&gt;, and in many cases you must store Chinese users’ data inside of China. If you’re not a huge company or don’t have much sensitive data on Chinese users this may not be an issue, but it’s something to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If most of your customers are outside of China and you just want to make sure your app/website loads quickly in China, then this is likely the best option for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-2-make-a-separate-chinese-version-of-your-appwebsite&quot;&gt;Option 2: Make a Separate Chinese Version of your App/Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most direct way to make your app/website work in China is, of course, to host your servers themselves in China. You can do that using a Chinese cloud provider like &lt;a href=&quot;https://alibabacloud.com&quot;&gt;Alicloud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.tencent.com&quot;&gt;Tencent cloud&lt;/a&gt;, or using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/&quot;&gt;AWS China region&lt;/a&gt;. If you use AWS, you should be aware that the China region requires setting up a different account, and isn’t even run by Amazon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most technically correct way to be in compliance with the Chinese government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/05/china-data-protection-regulations-cdpr.html&quot;&gt;data protection laws&lt;/a&gt; is to have a separate Chinese version of your app/website and run a separate version of your infrastructure in China. This allows all data for your Chinese users to stay in China and not be transferred abroad. No requests ever have to cross the firewall, so everything remains fast. Of course, it’s practically quite annoying to run 2 separate but identical versions of your infrastructure and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-3-proxy-requests-on-a-chinese-cloud-provider&quot;&gt;Option 3: Proxy Requests on a Chinese Cloud Provider&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese cloud providers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://alibabacloud.com&quot;&gt;Alicloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.tencent.com&quot;&gt;Tencent cloud&lt;/a&gt; have fast connections between their datacenters through the firewall that you can make use of. You can create a VPC inside of China and a VPC outside of China and then connect them using a form of VPC peering. This gives you a high-speed connection through the firewall which you can use to proxy requests. If you host your main infrastructure in a Chinese region then you’ll be in compliance with China’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinalawblog.com/2018/05/china-data-protection-regulations-cdpr.html&quot;&gt;data protection laws&lt;/a&gt;, while still being able to serve requests outside of China via the proxied connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-4-use-a-chinese-cloud-provider-acceleration-service&quot;&gt;Option 4: Use a Chinese Cloud Provider Acceleration Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re hosting your infrastructure on &lt;a href=&quot;https://alibabacloud.com&quot;&gt;Alicloud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.tencent.com&quot;&gt;Tencent cloud&lt;/a&gt; in China, you can accelerate requests to your infrastructure globally using their acceleration services. These work similarly to the Cloudflare option above, but in reverse. Alicloud calls their service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/55629.htm&quot;&gt;Global Acceleration&lt;/a&gt;, and Tencent cloud calls their &lt;a href=&quot;https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/gaap&quot;&gt;GAAP&lt;/a&gt;. This allows users globally to make requests to your servers in China and still have them be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3rd-party-services&quot;&gt;3rd Party Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which option you go with, you still need to test that your service is working in China. Even if you’re running on Chinese infrastructure or using Cloudflare China acceleration you may still be relying on APIs that aren’t supported in China, like Facebook Login or Google Recaptcha. If your server in China needs to make API calls to services that aren’t optimized in China you may find that a lot of those requests fail as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-luck&quot;&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Repl.it GFX: Native graphics development in the browser</title>
<link>https://repl.it/site/blog/gfx?ref=updates</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://repl.it/site/blog/gfx?ref=updates</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Repl.it we live and breathe making software creation easier. With our &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/site/blog/platform&quot;&gt;programming environment&lt;/a&gt;, you could start coding in your favorite language in seconds. With &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/site/blog/deploy&quot;&gt;live deployments&lt;/a&gt;, we made web hosting a breeze. With &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/site/blog/multi&quot;&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, we've removed the drudgery from coding with friends. And today, we're excited to bring native GUI applications and game development to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go on, you have to see this in action: Just run the repl below, wait a few seconds for it to load, focus on the output window and start playing Tetris in Pygame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take it up a notch and boot up this nifty desktop app we all love (might take up to a minute to load but then can be done recursively):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in the plurality and diversity of developer communities. That's why we spend countless days, weeks, and months working on features that can work cross language. We want programmers from all backgrounds, regardless of their language, to be able to code games and apps with ease. Plus, supporting native graphics opens us up to a wealth of frameworks, games, and educational material! We're particularly excited about supporting Pygame and Java Swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-jam&quot;&gt;Game Jam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to give you a reason to try out our new GUI capabilities, so we kicked off our very first &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/jam&quot;&gt;game jam&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th. It closes on April 18th, so there’s still plenty of time to show us what you can do. As for the winner? The grand prize is 1BTC ($4,031 at the time of writing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;50%&quot; src=&quot;https://repl.it/public/images/jam/bling-robot.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to release early and often. So while this works, and we're proud of what we've done, there's still a long way to go. Right now, we're piping the X Window system through VNC through WebSockets to your browser, which is not the most efficient way to do this — we have a lot of ideas on how we could improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay true to our &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/platform&quot;&gt;adaptive IDE&lt;/a&gt; principle — the IDE should &quot;do the right thing&quot; when you need it — we use &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/site/blog/stderr&quot;&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/a&gt; to figure out when an application is trying to open a window and then we start X in the background and reveal the screen in the environment. This has the effect of delighting our users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;2.4825174825175&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Awesome! Plotting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DcPy3gZFUO&quot;&gt;https://t.co/DcPy3gZFUO&lt;/a&gt; using GR and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JuliaLang?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JuliaLang&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/K4GPBjOZgR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/K4GPBjOZgR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Josef Heinen (@josef_heinen) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/josef_heinen/status/1104288994110644224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, depending on how far you are from our data center (US-central) you might feel a delay, which we're also working on making better by replicating our data center (watch out &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://store.google.com/magazine/stadia&quot;&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave us &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/feedback&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; so we can improve. Or come &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/jobs&quot;&gt;work with us&lt;/a&gt; so we can make it better together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early reception has been tremendous, and replers have been building amazing things. Take a look at some of the submissions in our &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://repl.it/talk/challenge&quot;&gt;game jam&lt;/a&gt; or give it a spin yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're supporting these frameworks out of the box, but very soon, we'll roll this out to all of our languages. If you're impatient, then you can use our base image to Install (pkg-install) and run your framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy game development!&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://julialang.org/blog/2019/03/debuggers</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;19 Mar 2019&lt;/span&gt;  |  &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy&quot;&gt;Tim Holy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KristofferC&quot;&gt;Kristoffer Carlsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pfitzseb&quot;&gt;Sebastian Pfitzner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Keno&quot;&gt;Keno Fischer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are pleased to announce the release of a fully-featured debugger for Julia. You can now easily debug and introspect Julia code in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.9792207792208&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step into functions and manually walk through your code while inspecting its state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set breakpoints and trap errors, allowing you to discover what went wrong at the point of trouble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactively update and replace existing code to rapidly fix bugs in place without restarting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the full-featured IDE in &lt;a href=&quot;http://junolab.org/&quot; title=&quot;Juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; to bundle all these features together in an easy to use graphical interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debugger is itself a collection of tools that enable those features. The core is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl&quot; title=&quot;JuliaInterpreter&quot;&gt;an interpreter&lt;/a&gt; that can faithfully run Julia code while allowing various front-ends to control its execution. Each front-end is its own package: &lt;a href=&quot;http://junolab.org/&quot; title=&quot;Juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; incorporates the debugger into its IDE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl&quot; title=&quot;Rebugger&quot;&gt;Rebugger&lt;/a&gt; provides a REPL text UI, and the traditional step/next/continue command-line interface is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl&quot; title=&quot;Debugger&quot;&gt;Debugger&lt;/a&gt;. All these new debugging capabilities seamlessly integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl&quot; title=&quot;Revise&quot;&gt;Revise&lt;/a&gt;, so that you can continuously analyze and modify code in a single session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To orient potential users to the debugger front-ends, here we include a couple of screen shots that highlight the new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juno provides a rich user interface around the interpreter and allows you to set breakpoints and step through directly in the source code. The debugger REPL can execute arbitrary code in a local context and the Workspace allows you to inspect local variables. The screenshot below shows a small debugging session for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/juno.png&quot; alt=&quot;Juno&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Juno.@run&lt;/code&gt; macro interprets your code and drops you in a debugging session if it hits a breakpoint, while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Juno.@enter&lt;/code&gt; allows you to step through starting from the first line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugger-and-rebugger&quot;&gt;Debugger and Rebugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different favorite editor than Atom—or sometimes work in remote sessions through a console interface—you can alternatively perform debugging via the REPL. There are two REPL interfaces: Debugger offers a “step, next, continue” interface similar to debuggers like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, whereas Rebugger aims to provide a console interface that is reminiscent of an IDE. Debugger has some capabilities that none of the other interfaces offer (e.g., very fine-grained control over stepping, the ability to execute the generator of generated functions, etc.), so it should be your go-to choice for particularly difficult cases. Below is a screenshot of a short session using Debugger.jl, showing some of its features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/debugger_jl_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Debugger.jl&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot, the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;closestpair&lt;/code&gt; is debugged by prepending the call with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@enter&lt;/code&gt; macro. Execution is then suspended on the first line of the function (line 4) and it is possible to see a breakpoint on line 8. Upon running the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (short for “continue”), execution is resumed until a breakpoint is encountered. At this point, the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fr&lt;/code&gt; (short for “frame”) shows all the local variables and their values at the point where the execution of the code suspended due to the breakpoint. Finally, a “Julia REPL mode” is entered using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; key. This gives a normal Julia REPL mode with the addition that the local variables are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebugger enters calls via a key binding. To try it, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcd(10, 20)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;without hitting enter&lt;/em&gt; type Meta-i (Esc-i, Alt-i, or option-i). After a short pause the display should update; type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to see the possible actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/rebugger_interpret.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rebugger&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebugger also features an “edit” interface. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://timholy.github.io/Rebugger.jl/dev/&quot;&gt;Rebugger’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With several packages making their initial debut, and some old ones getting new capabilities, we felt it would be appropriate to provide an overview of the underpinnings of the new ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;juliainterpreter&quot;&gt;JuliaInterpreter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl&quot; title=&quot;JuliaInterpreter&quot;&gt;JuliaInterpreter&lt;/a&gt; is the lynch pin of the entire stack; it contains the logic needed to evaluate and inspect running Julia code. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)&quot;&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt; lends itself naturally to step-wise code evaluation and the implementation of breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter descended from an original package &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/ASTInterpreter2.jl&quot;&gt;ASTInterpreter2&lt;/a&gt; written by Keno Fischer. In its original form (prior to Jan 2019), ASTInterpreter2 was a fairly small but sophisticated package, capable of handling many advanced aspects of Julia’s internal representation of code. It was in need of updating to the many changes in Julia 1.0, although most of that work had already been done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Roboneet&quot;&gt;Neethu Joy&lt;/a&gt; in late 2018. When we began our own efforts, we finished the updates and decided to extend it in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;36.196786016352&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter became recursive-by-default, interpreting calls all the way down to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ccall&lt;/code&gt;s, intrinsic functions, and builtin functions that define Julia’s lowest levels. By running virtually all code through the interpreter, it became more straightforward to implement breakpoints and trap errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14.389623601221&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter received numerous performance enhancements, and now can run step-wise through code at roughly 50× its original speed. These optimizations reduce—but come nowhere close to eliminating—the most serious disadvantage of running all code in the interpreter: slow performance. It is hoped that the performance gap between compiled and interpreted code, which can be many orders of magnitude, will narrow in the coming months. However, the interpreter will always be slower than compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that there are cases where the interpreter feels faster, at least on initial execution. Julia’s JIT compiler produces excellent results, but all that code-analysis takes time; there is interest in exploring whether running more code in the interpreter could reduce latency, a.k.a. the “time to first plot” problem. JuliaInterpreter is a potential tool for exploring that trade off, and it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl/issues/44&quot;&gt;not much additional work would be needed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;35.156428119063&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter gained the ability to interpret “top-level code”, for example the code used to define packages and create test suites. This was a major change, partly because top-level code uses an expanded vocabulary, but mostly because top-level code can define new modules, structures, and methods, which in turn introduces the need to manage “world age,” the counter that determines the visibility of methods to callers. (If this fails, you see errors like “method is too new to be called…”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting top-level code allowed JuliaInterpreter to achieve two goals: the ability to serve as the foundation of new code-parsing abilities for Revise, and the ability to run test suites originally designed for compiled Julia code. Once we had top-level execution partially working, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl/issues/13&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate JuliaInterpreter against the most extensive single test suite available, that of Julia itself. This revealed dozens of bugs in areas like the calling of C libraries (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ccall&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@cfunction&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cglobal&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;llvmcall&lt;/code&gt;, keyword-argument functions, generated functions, anonymous functions, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; definitions, global variables, the handling of try/catch, locks and threads, and the treatment of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@eval&lt;/code&gt;ed code. Some of these problems were isolated for us from the test suite failures by two additional contributors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GunnarFarneback&quot;&gt;Gunnar Farnebäck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/macd&quot;&gt;Don MacMillen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, most of the cleanly-isolated problems have been fixed. While we are still far from perfect, the pursuit of such a demanding goal has contributed extensively to the robustness of these young packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter gained support for breakpoints. While not strictly a feature of interpreters, they are necessary to build a capable debugger and can be viewed as an additional form of control-flow within the interpreter itself. These breakpoints can be set manually with functions &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;breakpoint&lt;/code&gt; and a macro &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@breakpoint&lt;/code&gt;, manipulated in Juno, Rebugger, or Debugger, or added directly to code with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@bp&lt;/code&gt; macro. Existing breakpoints can be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;disable&lt;/code&gt;d, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/code&gt;d, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt;d. We support setting of breakpoints at specific source lines or on entry to a specific method, conditional and unconditional breakpoints, and can automatically trap errors as if they were manually-set breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the interpreter in its own right, you can start like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;using JuliaInterpreter
A = rand(1:10, 5)
@interpret sum(A)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all is working well, you should see the same answer you get from running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum(A)&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@interpret&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;loweredcodeutils&quot;&gt;LoweredCodeUtils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/LoweredCodeUtils.jl&quot; title=&quot;LoweredCodeUtils&quot;&gt;LoweredCodeUtils&lt;/a&gt; is the most specialized and opaque of the new packages. Its purpose is to build links between multiple cooperating methods. For example, the seemingly-simple definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mymethod(x, y=0; z=&quot;Hello&quot;, msg=&quot;world&quot;) = 1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actually creates 5 methods: one “body method” (here, simply returning &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), two “positional-argument” methods (ones that do not accept any keyword arguments), and two “keyword function” methods (ones that get called when you supply at least one keyword argument, then fill in defaults and standardize order). Because all five of these arise from the same user-supplied expression, they need to be implicitly linked in order to provide a satisfying user experience. In particular, changes to source files cause the line numbers of compiled methods to become outdated; if we didn’t correct that, Juno might open a file to the outdated line number when stepping through code. LoweredCodeUtils does the source-level analysis to discover these associations and handle differences that arise when parsing the same file multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted to be able to parse Julia code and extract the signatures of the methods it defines (without redefining the methods), LoweredCodeUtils is the package for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;codetracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/CodeTracking.jl&quot; title=&quot;CodeTracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking&lt;/a&gt; was designed to act as a simple, lightweight “query API” for retrieving data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl&quot; title=&quot;Revise&quot;&gt;Revise&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, LoweredCodeUtils performs analysis, Revise manages changes that occur over time, and CodeTracking informs the rest of the world. For CodeTracking to do anything interesting, you need to be running Revise; to allow CodeTracking to be a lightweight dependency, it relies on Revise to populate its own internal variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/CodeTracking.jl&quot; title=&quot;CodeTracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking’s README&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;revise-and-rebugger&quot;&gt;Revise and Rebugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a rewrite based on JuliaInterpreter, Revise and Rebugger are better (in some cases, much better) at their core tasks. In particular, if you used an earlier version of Rebugger, you may have noticed that it was defeated by many language constructs (e.g., functions containing keyword arguments, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@eval&lt;/code&gt;-generated methods, etc). Most of the underlying causes were resolved by LoweredCodeUtils, which is in turn used by Revise, which then feeds the necessary data to CodeTracking for consumption by Rebugger. As one measure of the difference, of the more than 10,000 methods in Base, Revise 1.1.0 fails to capture 1,425 method signatures (a failure rate of 13%). In contrast, Revise 2.0.0 misses only 10 (&amp;lt;0.1%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in addition to the new “interpret” interface, the new Rebugger is much better at its original “edit” interface, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revise (and consequently Rebugger) has also gained some other new abilities, like handling methods defined at the REPL. In the longer term, the deep analysis of code permitted by JuliaInterpreter and LoweredCodeUtils may support features that were formerly out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been only a high-level overview. Some of the individual packages have extensive documentation, and interested readers are encouraged to work through it. For anyone looking to develop a deeper understanding of the internals of Julia’s code, the new packages provide a powerful set of tools for introspection and analysis. And of course, we hope that the new debugging capabilities further accelerate Julia’s rapid development, and make it that much more fun of a language to use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU businesses sign open letter against copyright directive articles 11 and 13</title>
<link>https://nextcloud.com/blog/130-eu-businesses-sign-open-letter-against-copyright-directive-art-11-13/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nextcloud.com/blog/130-eu-businesses-sign-open-letter-against-copyright-directive-art-11-13/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Members of the European Parliament,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The companies signing this letter to the European Parliament are urging you to &lt;strong&gt;vote against Articles 11 and 13&lt;/strong&gt; of the proposed copyright directive. The text of the trilogue agreement would &lt;strong&gt;harm the European economy&lt;/strong&gt; and seriously undermine the ability of European businesses to compete with big Internet giants like Google.
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;support the goal of the legislation&lt;/strong&gt; to protect the rights of creators and publishers, but &lt;strong&gt;the proposed measures are inadequate&lt;/strong&gt; to reap these benefits and also fail to strike a fair balance between creators and all other parts of society. The success of our business enterprises will be &lt;strong&gt;seriously jeopardized&lt;/strong&gt; by these heavy-handed EU regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially Article 13 is dangerously experimenting with the core foundation of the Internet’s ecosystem. Making companies directly liable for the content of their users forces these businesses to make billions of legal decisions about the legality of content. Most companies are neither equipped nor capable of implementing the automatic content filtering mechanisms this requires, which are expensive and prone to error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 11 is creating a completely new intellectual property right for press publishers. The experience with similar laws in Germany and Spain raises serious doubts about the expected benefits, while the negative impact would be very real. An additional layer of exclusive rights would make it harder to clear the necessary legal hurdles to start new projects. &lt;strong&gt;It will make entrepreneurs more hesitant to just launch new projects.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe would lose any chance to play a significant role on the world stage. Startups that build services based on aggregated online information would go out of business, and every company that publishes press summaries of their appearance in the media would be in violation of this law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the purpose of these regulations is to limit the powers of big US Internet companies like Google or Facebook, the proposed legislation would end up having the opposite effect. Article 13 requires filtering of massive amounts of data, requiring technology only the Internet giants have the resources to build. &lt;strong&gt;European companies will be thus forced to hand over their data to them, jeopardizing the independence of the European tech industry as well as the privacy of our users.&lt;/strong&gt; European companies like ours will be hindered in their ability to compete or will have to abandon certain markets completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of these issues it is noteworthy that the final trilogue agreement lacks meaningful safeguards for small and medium enterprises. The broad scope of this law would most likely lead to less new companies being founded in Europe and existing companies moving their headquarters out of Europe. &lt;strong&gt;For all those reasons we urge every pro-Startup politician to vote against Article 11 and Article 13.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
