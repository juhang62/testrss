&lt;p&gt;AltStore is an alternative app store for non-jailbroken iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AltStore is an iOS application that allows you to sideload other apps (.ipa files) onto your iOS device with just your Apple ID. AltStore resigns apps with your personal development certificate and sends them to a desktop app, AltServer, which installs the resigned apps back to your device using iTunes WiFi sync. To prevent apps from expiring, AltStore will also periodically refresh your apps in the background when on the same WiFi as AltServer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the initial release, I focused on building a solid foundation for distributing my own apps — primarily Delta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta&quot;&gt;my all-in-one emulator for iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Delta has been released, however, I'm beginning work on adding support for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to list and distribute their apps through AltStore (contributions welcome! 🙂).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resigns and installs any app with your Apple ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installs apps over WiFi using AltServer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshes apps periodically in the background to prevent them from expiring (when on same WiFi as AltServer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles app updates directly through AltStore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xcode 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS 12.2+ (AltStore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macOS 10.14.4+ (AltServer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swift 5+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why iOS 12.2+ and macOS 10.14.4+? Doing so allows me to distribute all AltStore apps without embedding Swift libraries inside them. This helps me afford bandwidth costs by reducing download sizes by roughly 30%, but also noticeably improves how long it takes to install/refresh apps with AltStore. If you're compiling AltStore and/or AltServer yourself, however, you should be able to lower their deployment targets to iOS 12.0 and macOS 10.14.0, respectively, without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AltStore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltStore is just a regular, sandboxed iOS application. The AltStore app target contains the vast majority of AltStore's functionality, including all the logic for downloading and updating apps through AltStore. AltStore makes heavy use of standard iOS frameworks and technologies most iOS developers are familiar with, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storyboards/Nibs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background App Refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network.framework (new in iOS 12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AltServer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltServer is also just a regular, sandboxed macOS application. AltServer is significantly less complex than AltStore though, and for that reason consists of only a handful of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AltKit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltKit is a shared framework that includes common code between AltStore and AltServer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AltSign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltSign is my internal framework used by both AltStore and AltServer to communicate with Apple's servers and resign apps. For more info, check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rileytestut/altsign&quot;&gt;AltSign repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roxas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxas is my internal framework used across all my iOS projects, developed to simplify a variety of common tasks used in iOS development. For more info, check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rileytestut/roxas&quot;&gt;Roxas repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compilation Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AltStore and AltServer are both fairly straightforward to compile and run if you're already an iOS or macOS developer. To compile AltStore and/or AltServer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Clone the repository
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Update submodules:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cd AltStore 
git submodule update --init --recursive
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;AltStore.xcworkspace&lt;/code&gt; and select the AltStore project in the project navigator. On the &lt;code&gt;Signing &amp;amp; Capabilities&lt;/code&gt; tab, change the team from &lt;code&gt;Yvette Testut&lt;/code&gt; to your own account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(AltStore only)&lt;/strong&gt; Change the value for &lt;code&gt;ALTDeviceID&lt;/code&gt; in the Info.plist to your device's UDID. Normally, AltServer embeds the device's UDID in AltStore's Info.plist during installation. When running through Xcode you'll need to set the value yourself or else AltStore won't resign (or even install) apps for the proper device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(AltStore only)&lt;/strong&gt; Change the value for &lt;code&gt;ALTServerID&lt;/code&gt; in the Info.plist to your AltServer's serverID. This is embedded by AltServer during installation to help AltStore distinguish between multiple AltServers on the same network, and you can find this by using a Bonjour browsing application and noting the serverID advertised by AltServer. This isn't strictly necessary, because if AltStore can't find the AltServer with the embedded serverID it still falls back to trying another AltServer. However, this will help in cases where there are multiple AltServers running (plus the error messages are more helpful).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(AltServer only)&lt;/strong&gt; Install Carthage (if you use Homebrew, you can do this with &lt;code&gt;brew install carthage&lt;/code&gt;). Then run &lt;code&gt;carthage update&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory of the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build + run app! 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Licensing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the licensing of some dependencies used by AltStore, I have no choice but to distribute AltStore under the &lt;strong&gt;AGPLv3 license&lt;/strong&gt;. That being said, my goal for AltStore is for it to be an open source project &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can use without restrictions, so I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences (dependencies remain under their original licenses, however).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact Me&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>About iSH’s pending removal from the App Store</title>
<link>https://ish.app/app-store-removal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ish.app/app-store-removal</guid>

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, October 26th, just four days after we launched iSH on the App Store, we received a call from Apple informing us that they had found our app noncompliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines and that they would remove the app from sale if we did not submit a satisfactory update within two weeks. Despite our best efforts, we do not believe we will be able to bring iSH into compliance by tomorrow, the conclusion of this 14 day period, and we expect iSH to no longer be available to download from the App Store after that time. We are working our hardest to get iSH back on the App Store as soon as possible and hope for your understanding and support as we navigate our next steps in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for using iSH!&lt;br/&gt;Theodore Dubois, Saagar Jha &amp;amp; Martin Persson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-ish-being-removed&quot;&gt;Why is iSH being removed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple believes iSH is not compliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which governs applications which download and run executable code. Specifically, they believe that iSH “is not self-contained and has remote package updating functionality”, and suggest that we should “remove the remote network activity functionality which could allow for remote code importing into the app, such as wget or curl, or other remote network commands”. Additional communication with Apple has indicated that they believe that iSH is a security concern if we allow any sort of code importing by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe iSH is fully compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://saagarjha.com/blog/2020/11/08/fixing-section-2-5-2/&quot;&gt;Saagar has written&lt;/a&gt; a more detailed analysis of why we believe this rejection is incorrect, how we believe Apple has misinterpreted and misapplied this rule to our app, and describe how 2.5.2’s poor wording coupled with the review team being unable to review functionality of scripting applications leads to mistaken classifications like these. At a high level, Apple has selectively targeted iSH using section 2.5.2 without fullying understanding our application, their own guidelines, or the consequences of what they are asking and how they affect the App Store ecosystem as a whole. &lt;strong&gt;Consistent enforcement of Apple’s incorrect interpretation would require the removal of all scripting apps, including many of the most popular applications in the App Store and some of Apple’s own applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-we-done-to-get-ish-back-on-the-app-store&quot;&gt;What have we done to get iSH back on the App Store?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working for the last two weeks to try to keep iSH available without interruptions. We have drafted numerous appeals, requests for clarifications, rule modifications, and explanatory emails. We’ve been on the phone with Apple for hours. Unfortunately, even with this we have been unable to resolve the issue, and the process has been significantly more stressful than we would have liked it to be. Theodore, the primary iSH liaison to Apple, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbodt.com/2020/11/08/app-review-experiences.html&quot;&gt;has written about&lt;/a&gt; how this process should be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first interaction with the App Store review team actually dates back to May, not October: we wanted to know what Apple thought of iSH, since we weren’t sure how the rules would be enforced for it. Of course, iSH complies with the letter of the guidelines, but review found it to violate 2.5.2 because it could download Linux executable code. The problem appeared that apk lets you install packages, so we decided to remove it and work on other features to make the app more useful in its absence. We submitted this updated build in October and this was what is currently on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our build was flagged for noncompliance, we went through the usual review process: we first asked for clarification, and then after we realized that the rule was being misapplied we submitted a rule change request and of course appealed the decision as well. As the deadline approached we sent off an email to Phil Schiller as well detailing our situation. Unfortunately none of this led anywhere, which brings up to our current situation today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-this-mean-i-cant-use-ish-anymore&quot;&gt;Does this mean I can’t use iSH anymore?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not at all. However, it will mean that you will no longer be able to get iSH from the App Store, which is something which we would still like to be able to provide. The App Store remains the easiest and most popular method of software distribution on iOS, and we’re working hard to save iSH’s listing because we think the app should have a permanent spot there for users who prefer this method of distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removal of iSH’s listing on the App Store should not affect your use of iSH if you download the app before it is removed. We have not received any compliance messages from Apple regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O&quot;&gt;our TestFlight beta&lt;/a&gt;, so we plan to continue offering prerelease versions of iSH there for up to 10,000 beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precompiled builds of iSH (distributed as IPA files) will &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ish-app/ish/releases&quot;&gt;remain available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ish.app/altstore&quot;&gt;installation through AltStore&lt;/a&gt; and for jailbroken users. Advanced users are welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ish-app/ish#build-for-ios&quot;&gt;build iSH&lt;/a&gt; themselves—it’s free and open source and always will be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bubble&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/a_Shell_iOS/status/1325526061099196416&quot;&gt;a-Shell has mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that they have received a similar rejection notice. Apple may be running extra review for scripting apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ish.app/&quot;&gt;Return home&lt;/a&gt; | 2020-11-08&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Transmit Radio Signals via Ethernet</title>
<link>https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Etherify - bringing the ether back to ethernet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c) 2020 Jacek Lipkowski SQ5BPF &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sq5bpf@lipkowski.org&quot;&gt;sq5bpf@lipkowski.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main page here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lipkowski.com/etherify&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://lipkowski.com/etherify&lt;/a&gt; Demo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ueC4SLPrtNg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/ueC4SLPrtNg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are attempts to transmit via leakage from ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;################################################################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etherify1.sh - sends data wirelessly by changing the speed of an ethernet interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;./etherify1.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If is given, then the contents are sent, else &quot;etherify 1 demo&quot; is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works by switching between 10Mbps and 100Mbps, which results in a change of the electromagnetic radiation that leaks from the devices. Switching to 100Mbps produces a signal at 125MHz, which is used to transmit morse code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested on 2 raspberry pi 4 running Raspbian 10 connected together via 2m ethernet cable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other raspberry pi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killall dhcpcd #disable any other software messing with the eth0 interface, such as NetworkManager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ifconfig eth0 up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ethtool eth0 #verify link is up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;./etherify1.sh /tmp/secret.txt #to leak out the contents of /tmp/secret.txt ./etherify1.sh # or just to send the standard text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;################################################################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etherify2.sh - silly hack to send data wirelessly by generating load on the ethernet interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;./etherify2.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If is given, then the contents are sent, else &quot;etherify 2 demo&quot; is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested on 2 raspberry pi 4 running Raspbian 10 connected together via 2m ethernet cable This probably works by loading the supply voltage when the packets are generated. A change of voltage probably changes the frequency of some clock slightly, thus generating FSK (F1A to be exact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one raspberry pi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killall dhcpcd #disable any other software messing with the eth0 interface, such as NetworkManager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 #not sure why ifconfig doesn't set the route&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other raspberry pi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killall dhcpcd #disable any other software messing with the eth0 interface, such as NetworkManager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 #not sure why ifconfig doesn't set the route&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ping 192.168.1.1 #verify you have connectivity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;./etherify2.sh /tmp/secret.txt #to leak out the contents of /tmp/secret.txt ./etherify2.sh # or just to send the standard text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#######################################################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were tested on 2 raspberry pi 4 connected together via a 2m ethernet cable included in the raspberry pi starter kit. The choice of hardware was done so that it would be simple to reproduce it anywhere. The tests were also done with other hardware, etherify1.sh works with most hardware, etherify2.sh works only with some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please tune the receiver to around 125MHz in CW mode with a very narrow filter. Sometimes AM mode can also be used. The tests were performed with a Yaesu FT-817 receiver with a 500Hz CW filter (cw decoded by ear), and with and SDR receiver using an rtl-sdr dvb-t dongle, with gqrx as the receiver and fldigi as the morse decoder (or decoded by ear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During tests etherify1.sh could be received at a distance of 100m, and etherify2.sh could be received at a distance of 30m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;conduct the tests in an electromagnetically quiet area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software decoders are very bad at decoding morse code in the presence of interference, and with imperfect timing. If you want to assess if the signal is decodable, then get someone who can receive by ear (such as an experienced amateur radio operator). Humans are way better at this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run this as root (etherify2.sh could be made to run non-root with udp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://lipkowski.com/etherify&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://lipkowski.com/etherify&lt;/a&gt; for further reading&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Clues to identify a destructive leader</title>
<link>https://articles.tilt365.com/identify-destructive-leadership-patterns/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://articles.tilt365.com/identify-destructive-leadership-patterns/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In many aspects of our lives, we rely on those in positions of power to lead us. The role of leaders becomes especially salient in times of uncertainty. Throughout your life, you’ve probably seen several ways leaders can respond to challenging and ambiguous situations. A transformational leader can see the opportunities in turmoil and inspire people to follow them to a better future. On the other hand, an incompetent leader will leave you to deal with everything alone. In the worst-case scenario, a destructive leader will see the potential for self-enhancement and exploit others to maximize their gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 600w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1000w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1069w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;4 Clues to Identify a Destructive Leader
&lt;h3 id=&quot;people-leave-managers-not-companies-&quot;&gt;People leave managers, not companies.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incompetent and destructive leaders both create negative consequences, but the distinction between the two is essential. An incompetent leader may lack the compelling charisma to engage others to follow, but we wouldn’t call someone lacking charisma actively destructive. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199755615.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199755615-e-014&quot;&gt;destructive leader&lt;/a&gt; intentionally and systematically behaves in a way that violates the organization’s members and stakeholders’ best interests. The extent of damage that a destructive leader can cause often goes unnoticed until it is too late (e.g., Enron), but there are clues you can look for to help you identify destructive leaders earlier. These clues reflect behaviors and attitudes that can reveal the destructive nature of an otherwise seemingly competent leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-causes-destructive-leadership-patterns&quot;&gt;What causes destructive leadership patterns?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has some characteristics that are annoying to someone who prefers a different way of behaving and working. These characteristics are inherited in our DNA and influenced by the environment in which we grew up. The genetic influence was passed down from generation to generation and is a product of evolution that helped your ancestors survive the environments they encountered. And they can help you too, as long as they don’t become distorted from early experiences of chronic fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In destructive leadership, typical behavior patterns become distorted into extremes powered by the brain’s more primitive parts under such circumstances. When this happens, we are in fear-mode, and a blend of fear reactions becomes our norm. These distorted patterns become habitual, and our responses to others become unhealthy. For example, suppose we experienced excessive criticism in our early development. In that case, our ego will record a perception of being diminished by important caregivers and sense that our very survival depends on not being criticized. In this case, we may learn to strive excessively for superiority to alleviate the fear of feeling inferior in our assessment of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a reactive pattern like this helped us survive the precise environment we were born into, in a global world, that same pattern may not. The brain’s brilliant design constructs a set of behaviors that will ensure our survival in whatever we experience in the development years to maturity. But if we move to an entirely new environment as an adult, the patterns that served us before may not translate into helpful practices somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-reason-anxiety-and-stress-are-at-an-all-time-high-&quot;&gt;The reason anxiety and stress are at an all-time high.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last century, this phenomenon has become even more complicated. With the advancement of technology comes exposure to human systems all over the world. Transportation enables moving to any part of the globe in a day or two. As we move about rapidly from one culture to another, we find ourselves unable to understand why we are perceived positively in one environment and the opposite in another. No wonder anxiety and stress are at an all-time high, especially for those who interact in global companies. Adaptation to other cultures becomes a necessity, making self-awareness and emotional intelligence some of the most critical skill sets of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-look-for-the-underlying-intention-&quot;&gt;First, look for the underlying intention.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all human systems are imperfect, and most parents do the best they can do, many of us have traces of fear behaviors that can drive others nuts. There are a few prototypical examples of these types of behaviors, including, but not limited to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The constant worrier who is always second-guessing themselves,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storyteller who seems to live in an ideal world no one else can relate to,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dominant driver who wants everything to go their way,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prideful judge who doesn’t realize they can’t possibly know everything there is to know about everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re talking about destructive leadership, we’re not merely referring to annoying habits unless they have become very extreme or painfully frequent. Destructive leaders have little interest in how they are perceived, so they are rarely interested in how they could improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;destructive-leaders-are-single-mindedly-self-interested-&quot;&gt;Destructive leaders are single-mindedly self-interested.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, healthy leaders may have annoying habits, but when you look beneath the surface, two things are different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They adopt a mindset that conveys they care about their impact on others and are willing to listen, learn, and exert the choice and character to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They hold a positive intention toward others and work for the good of the mission and the enterprise they serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, destructive leaders are either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Un-coachable because they adopt a rigid mindset that conveys they don’t care about their impact on others and will use their authority to manipulate others to bend to their will. They imply, “I am who I am, so deal with it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have a hidden ulterior motive for wanting and using power to serve themselves at the expense of others, the mission, or the enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as we lay out the four clues of destructive leaders, keep two things in mind. Do you have a hunch that they are well-intended, and are they willing to work on themselves? If the answer to both is affirmative, they are probably not destructive, but just like you and me, they are trying to serve their company and grow as best they can. In these circumstances, we can mind our own business and work on our self-improvement plan rather than thinking about how annoying they are. After all, it’s temporary unless they are genuinely destructive. And then you must do everything in your power to remove them from your company, or they could take the whole thing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clue-1-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-i-m-kind-of-a-big-deal-&quot;&gt;Clue 1: Behaviors or words that imply “I’m kind of a big deal!”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive fabrication and exaggeration that is nowhere near the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough attention from caregivers, so they do not feel special. This dilemma results in insatiable attention-seeking and an inflated need to be special, unique, or novel. The inner fear is feeling trapped in the loneliness or sadness of not being “special” enough to those who matter. Because they perceive being attention-deprived or unworthy, they feel shame, and it becomes so painful, they rebel from authority figures whom they believe could not be trusted. Instead of following appropriately, they become rebellious and provocative, conning others to go along with their fantastic plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clues-you-will-notice-&quot;&gt;Clues you will notice:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exaggeration of the truth to the point of fantasy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unapologetic self-promoting and self-aggrandizing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive talking to dominate others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pontification and fabrication of elaborate stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disrespect for authority figures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disregard for rules that are contrary to their aims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically dismiss ideas from others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An insatiable need to be the center of attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminally individualistic, unique, or novel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External image is unusually extreme in some way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-in-a-chaotic-climate&quot;&gt;Results in a Chaotic Climate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they demand attention but don’t want the restrictions that come with being front and center. When they are in the limelight, it can be exceedingly uncomfortable because they also unconsciously fail to believe they are impressive enough. So they attract attention, initiate excessive activity, and then thwart the attention this draws. This pattern makes them unpredictable, so the shadow of the climate they create around them is chaotic and confusing for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clue-2-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-none-of-this-is-my-fault-&quot;&gt;Clue 2: Behaviors or words that imply “None of this is my fault!”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive conflict-avoidance by deflecting personal responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough approval and acceptance. This dilemma results in insatiable approval-seeking and an excessive need to be liked by everyone, even strangers. The inner fear is to be rejected or ridiculed by others as unlovable by those who matter. Because they perceive being unacceptable to others, they feel powerless and unworthy of care. This experience can become painful and they are unable to communicate or ask others for what they need because they don’t feel they deserve it. They defer to those in authority roles and suffer quietly in dependence, hopelessness, and seen as “needy” for any shred of approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clues-you-will-notice--1&quot;&gt;Clues you will notice:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complaining, blaming, gossiping about others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disgruntled resentment of those in authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving up their power and being dependent on others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come across as “needy” and draining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking others to decide and then resenting it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding leadership to avoid culpability later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconsciously inviting others to dominate them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blaming others for being the “bully”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire to be the “nice” or “good” one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An insatiable need to be liked, accepted, included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-in-a-conflict-averse-climate&quot;&gt;Results in a Conflict Averse Climate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they put extreme energy into taking care of or helping others with an unstated expectation that there will be a reward in return. For example, they take care of someone with the expectation that the other person will take the responsibility of making decisions for them. However, they may not tell the other person this expectation. There is an unconscious deflection of blame because they don’t want to be accountable for potentially adverse outcomes. In this way, they can remain blameless of all actions and continue to believe that they are “good” or “innocent.” This pattern creates an environment of bitter finger-pointing and undermines the mission, their leaders, and others, all so they can remain blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clue-3-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-just-do-what-i-say-&quot;&gt;Clue 3: Behaviors or words that imply “Just do what I say!”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive dominance over others by disregarding their humanity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough autonomy and power over circumstances because of controlling authority figures. This dilemma results in insatiable power-seeking and an excessive need to dominate others or even objectify them. Instead of valuing other human beings in their own right, they see them as objects that are useful to their objectives and manipulate them. The inner fear is to be considered weak or vulnerable. Because they need to perceive themselves as all-powerful, they seek to be the heroic warrior who will save others, when the real underlying intent is to protect themselves from their deep-seated fear of vulnerability. They end up feeling angry at anyone who shows signs of weakness or being human in any way, in favor of demonstrating impenetrable vitality that is invincible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clues-you-will-notice--2&quot;&gt;Clues you will notice:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dismissal of others as useless to their agenda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequent impatience with how slow others are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disregard for the values or needs of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appears unsympathetic to others’ concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparent inability to be still long enough to have a two-way conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparent inability to be quiet long enough to listen to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A belief that they are the heroic warrior who will save the weak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disdain for human frailty or weakness of any kind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objectifies others and uses them for their goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demands for loyalty at all costs in exchange for protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-in-an-autocratic-climate&quot;&gt;Results in an Autocratic Climate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they demand unquestioning loyalty. They will use their power to protect others’ from harm, but they require absolute subservience in return. They disregard moral values that may get in their way, and they expect those around them not to question them and do the same. They are aggressive toward anyone who shows a lack of loyalty in any way. The disloyal are dismissed and disregarded quickly. You are either “in” or “out,” and there is no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clue-4-trust-me-i-m-never-wrong-&quot;&gt;Clue 4: “Trust me; I’m never wrong.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The excessive diminishing of others and disdain for their lack of knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not being smart enough to make logical choices because authority figures consistently discount them. This dilemma results in an insatiable status-seeking and an excessive need to be seen as important by others. The inner fear is being seen as insignificant, which is painful because it implies that you are less than others or not enough—being “less than” causes intense feelings of inferiority. Because they see this as intolerable, they do everything in their power to earn external credentials that will prove outward signs of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;clues-you-will-notice--3&quot;&gt;Clues you will notice:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dismissal of others as stupid or unintelligent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never forgets mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupts to say what is wrong before others finish speaking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unwilling to rely on others who cannot live up to their standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come across as cold and unapproachable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfectionism that becomes excessive and obsessive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moralistic whistleblowing and condemnation of authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judging others as idiots who don’t know anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessively critical of anything that is not perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating impossible standards that no one can reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-in-a-climate-of-stagnation-&quot;&gt;Results in a Climate of Stagnation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they set standards so high that nothing and no one can ever be good enough. The insatiable desire to outwit others and prove them wrong leads to an uncertain, withholding climate that focuses on a negative perspective on everything. Tossing out objections first becomes the norm, and the unintended consequence is to avoid the work required to do everything right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;now-what&quot;&gt;Now what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recognize these patterns in your current leadership team, you may want to be cautious. Remember that destructive leaders are more than just annoying. They are intentionally self-serving to the detriment of others. This self-focus does not mean they are incapable of improving since people are always capable of change if they choose, but it may indicate they don’t WANT to change. Understanding their motivations can help you recognize when they are using you to satisfy their unconscious internal fears. You can use this knowledge to create a strategy to interact with them in a way that minimizes damage to yourself, or if you can’t, you can begin to plan your exit or transfer to a new leader or company if needed. If you’ve already thought about leaving your organization because of one of these leaders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ddiworld.com/ebooks/FLL-eBook-interactive.pdf&quot;&gt;you are not alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see some of these clues in yourself, all is not lost. Most people can identify with one or two of these patterns. BUT if they become extreme, they will eventually hurt you and everyone around you. Destructive patterns may create short-term wins but will not help you in the long run because they are not sustainable. The quick wins may seem “right” now, but they may come at a high cost later since they are likely to backfire. However, if you are aware of it, you can move past these fear-based behaviors with conscious development. You have the choice to stop fear from controlling your actions and decisions if you commit to becoming a better leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thread-question__payload&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Since updating to Android 11, I cannot take screenshots anymore. The screenshot is taken but then the notification appears stating that &quot;Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization.&quot;&lt;p&gt;This happens all the time no matter where I try to screenshot, even when screenshoting the desktop. There is no G Suite account set up in the phone, so there is no organization that could prevent screenshotting. Also the new feature of screen recoding works without issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried restarting the phone several times, it didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having this issue as well. Pixel 4a. I have already tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- reset app preferences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- flash factory images (no wipe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- remove G suite accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- disable all device admins except &quot;find my device&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- revert from nova launcher to pixel launcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has yet worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Removing the &quot;.nomedia&quot; file from my snapshot folder solved the issue. Not sure whether I created the file or not, but apparently excluding it from the library breaks snapshots. Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Wes, I had the same issue as well and your solution fixed it for me (on Pixel 4), thanks man! Also for those who read this and are unsure of what to do on Pixel 4, the &quot;Files&quot; app or shortcut got changed to one of the tiles on the pull-down menu (where you see you WiFi, Mobile Data, Bluetooth, etc.) and is titled &quot;Storage&quot;. Once there, you'll want to go to &quot; Browse&quot; on the bottom right, and then select &quot;Internal Storage&quot;. Once there, you'll want to scroll down to the &quot;Pictures&quot; folder. At the bottom is where you can find the &quot;.nomedia&quot; file. I deleted it and that worked for me, but you could moving it if you'd like. You may or may not need to turn on the setting to see hidden files in order to find this, so if you can't find it make sure to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep your .nomedia folder the trick is to rename .nomedia to ..nomedia (note: 2 dots In front of the word nomedia instead of one).  Android still treats the folder as hidden folder but it also solves the screenshot problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thread-message__payload&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;1. Download &quot;Nomedia&quot; by g(x) labs from the app store.&lt;br/&gt;2. Find your Screenshots folder within the Nomedia app.
&lt;p&gt;3. The slider should be blue, uncheck it to delete the .nomedia file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .nomedia in my pixel 3 is located internal storage:  /pictures/ and /picture/Screenshots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I delete the two .nomedia files, I can use the screenshot (by using power + vol down). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you can use 3rd party file manager app to locate these files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having this issue as well. Pixel 4a. I have already tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- reset app preferences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- flash factory images (no wipe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- remove G suite accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- disable all device admins except &quot;find my device&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- revert from nova launcher to pixel launcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has yet worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Removing the &quot;.nomedia&quot; file from my snapshot folder solved the issue. Not sure whether I created the file or not, but apparently excluding it from the library breaks snapshots. Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thread-message__payload&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;The steps above regarding getting rid of the .nomedia folder are what solved this issue for me. 
&lt;p&gt;Originally I couldn't see the option to reveal hidden folder but following these steps i was able to fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold down on the files icon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ App info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ click the 3 dots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~uninstall updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold down on the pictures icon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~App info &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ click the 3 dots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~uninstall updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the files app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~in settings show hidden files select yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~Go to the internal storage folder and remove .nomedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open play store and select my apps to re-update the apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restarting my Pixel 3 the errors were completely gone. Able to take screenshots and photos once again. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

<title>One Week of NixOS</title>

<description>&lt;h4&gt;One week of NixOS&lt;/h4&gt;
Reading time: 4 minutes.

&lt;p&gt;As you may have seen I on Mastodon, I am testing NixOS for over a week now and here is a few comments about how the distro works and what doesn’t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, everything is NixOS is declared in a configuration file located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; where you declare packages you want to install, services to start, udev rules, ECT, you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first very weird thing as you don’t really install packages with the CLI directly (even if you can), instead you modify the config file and rebuild the system with &lt;code&gt;nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NixOS is made in such a way that everything aims to be reproducible. An example: if you want to get the exact same setup as I have, you can just take &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.tedomum.net/jae/nixos-configs&quot;&gt;my configs repo&lt;/a&gt;, clone it on your NixOS installation, run &lt;code&gt;nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt; and voilà, you will have the exact same programs as me installed in the same way with the same version (roughly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this distro, adding a user is really easy and goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chroma&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;lntable&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;lntd&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;22

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what everything does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Creates a group named &lt;code&gt;plugdev&lt;/code&gt;, don’t pay attention to it, it is just a test for the Ledger Live application.

&lt;code class=&quot;language-nixos&quot; data-lang=&quot;nixos&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isNormalUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Tells the os that the current user is a normal one. It will create a home folder and set the default shell.
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chroma&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;lntable&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;lntd&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Here, we are setting the groups the user is in to grant special permissions.
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chroma&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;lntable&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;lntd&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;lntd&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;chroma&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-nixos&quot; data-lang=&quot;nixos&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pkgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;zsh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
As you may have guessed it, we are setting the default user shell to ZSH.
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chroma&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;lntable&quot; readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;lntd&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lnt&quot;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# SDR&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rtl-sdr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gqrx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gpredict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;noaa-apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;welle-io&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
There, we are installing per-user packages because yes, NixOS supports that, any user can have its own packages that others users can’t access.
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correction from &lt;em&gt;hvdijk&lt;/em&gt; on Hacker News, “&lt;em&gt;Other users can access those packages if they want to. Those packages won’t show up in other users' $PATH, so other users will not be affected by them, but they could see what’s in /nix/store if they wanted to. This matters when you’re thinking of putting private data (such as an encryption key) in a package: it’s vital that you don’t do that on a multi-user system.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring NixOS for a daily use is at the end very easy (although I am getting some trouble to get Ledger Live working; which is the biggest problem I’ve had so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s talk about where I got some trouble. As you may know it, I am a dev and every day I need to compile, test, run and so on. NixOS gave me some trouble to only run some programs from source such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://element.io&quot;&gt;Element Desktop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://img.tedomum.net&quot;&gt;TeDomum IMG&lt;/a&gt; as the way the system is built, lots of directories are read-only and programs can’t be installed globally through NPM or PIP. I ended up using Docker to build the apps (even if it took a bit more time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, almost every other project worked. If you want NodeJS to start a project for instance, you can just do &lt;code&gt;nix-shell -p nodejs&lt;/code&gt; and here you go, a shell with nodejs installed, ready to do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, NixOS brings very interesting concepts such as a really great reproducibility but new users can feel lost as its way to work is really different from conventional Linux distributions. I’ll give NixOS more time and write a follow-up in some time to see how everything went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to give it a shot, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/&quot;&gt;official NixOS website awaits you&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for today, I’ll see you next time! If you like my content, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jae.moe/blog/index.xml&quot;&gt;don’t forget to subscribe through RSS&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
