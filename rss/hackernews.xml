<title>Reddit confirms $300M Series D led by China’s Tencent at $3B value</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/raiseit/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch reported that Reddit was raising&lt;/a&gt; $150 million from Chinese tech giant Tencent and up to $150 million more in a Series D that would value the company at $2.7 billion pre-money or $3 billion post-money. After no-commenting on our scoop, today &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/reddit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;reddit&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; confirmed it has raised $300 million at $3 billion post-money, with $150 million from Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal makes for an odd pairing between one of the architects of China’s Great Firewall of censorship and one of America’s most lawless free-speech forums. Some Redditors are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47194096&quot;&gt;protesting the funding&lt;/a&gt; by trying to post content that would rile Chinese’s internet watchdogs, like imagery from Tiananmen Square and Winnie the Pooh memes mocking Chinese President Xi Jinping’s appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The round brings the Conde Nast-majority owned Reddit to $550 million in total funding. Beyond Tencent, the rest of the round came from previous investors potentially including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia and Fidelity. Apparently frustrated that we had disrupted its PR plan, Reddit today handed confirmation of the round to CNBC, which re-reported our scoop without citation. While CNBC reported in June 2018 that Reddit would top $100 million in revenue, a reliable source tells us Reddit only brought in $85 million in 2018 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit’s CEO Steve Huffman has had his own problems with attribution after the exec was caught editing users’ comments to mislead viewers into thinking they were insulting their Subreddit’s moderators. Huffman managed to get off with just an apology and vow not to do it again, though he seemed to laugh off and excuse the abuse of power by saying “I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit will have to compete for ad dollars with the Google-Facebook duopoly despite having less information about its users, who are often anonymous. Reddit sees 330 million users per month across its Subreddit forums for discussing everything from news and entertainment to niche types of pornography, conspiracy theories and other highly brand-unsafe content. Meanwhile, users may be concerned that Reddit’s policy views could be tightened as it cosies up to Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit has struggled with staff departures and user revolts over the years as it tries to balance freedom of expression with civility. The hope is the cash could help it pay for experienced leaders and more moderation staff to maintain that balance. But without proper oversight, the cash could simply scale up Reddit and its problems along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple and Google accused of hosting Saudi gov&amp;#039;t app that tracks women</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-criticised-for-saudi-government-app-activists-say-fuel-discrimination-2019-2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-criticised-for-saudi-government-app-activists-say-fuel-discrimination-2019-2</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple and Google have been accused of helping to &quot;enforce gender apartheid&quot; in Saudi Arabia, by offering a sinister app that allows men to track women and stop them leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sa.gov.moi&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1/id1004966456?mt=8&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; host Absher, a government web service that allows men to specify when and how women can cross Saudi borders, and to get close to real-time SMS updates when they travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Absher also has benign functions — like paying parking fines — but its travel features have been identified by activists and refugees as a major factor in the continued difficulty women have leaving Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neither Apple nor Google responded to repeated requests for comment from INSIDER over several days before the publication of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisisinsider.com/absher-saudi-website-men-control-women-stop-escape-2019-1&quot;&gt;INSIDER reported on the existence of Absher last week&lt;/a&gt;, along with the story of Shahad Al Mohaimeed, a Saudi teen refugee who evaded the system to claim asylum in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a screenshot from a desktop version of Absher, with added labels to explain its functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;On this form guardians can say where women can go, how long for, and which airports they can go to. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Absher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;A page on Absher where a guardian can see which permissions are active, and easily change them if needed. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Absher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since the story was published, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both expressed concern about Google's and Apple's roles in hosting the app, which has been installed on smartphones more than 1 million times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Human Rights Watch told INSIDER: &quot;Apple and Google have rules against apps that facilitate threats and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Apps like this one can facilitate human rights abuses, including discrimination against women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have warned Google and Apple about the repercussions this app can have on women in Saudi Arabia. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Beck Diefenbach/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amnesty International told INSIDER that the SMS alerts are &quot;another example of how the Saudi Arabian government has produced tools to limit women's freedoms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It called on Apple and Google to accept that the app is being used to harm women, and demand changes to stop it happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-qa-the-hurdles-and-obstacles-saudi-women-runaways-face-2019-1?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: The hurdles and obstacles Saudi women runaways face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yasmine Mohammed, a former Muslim and an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia, told INSIDER that the companies are &quot;facilitating the most archaic misogyny&quot; and help the Saudi government to enforce &quot;gender apartheid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to the Google Play store, Absher has been downloaded on Android devices more than 1 million times. Apple does not disclose download figures for apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;The login page of the iOS Absher app in Arabic, asking for a government ID and password. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Absher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The alert system, which can be set up inside Absher, is one of the main reasons women trying to flee Saudi Arabia get caught, according to activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The function tips off male guardians while the fleeing women can still be apprehended, according to Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a Saudi refugee who sought asylum in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, also told INSIDER about the SMS alerts and corroborated Al Abdulmohsen's story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are the criticisms of Google and Apple in full:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rothna Begum, Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple and Google have rules against apps that facilitate threats and harassment. Apps like this one can facilitate human rights abuses, including discrimination against women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;In evaluating whether an app should be allowed, app store providers should be considering the broader context of the purpose of the app, how it is used in practice, and whether it facilitates serious abuses. Companies should apply extra scrutiny to government-operated apps in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Even though the app is more general purpose, the government could simply remove the guardianship tracking functionality from the app, and continue to offer the rest of the functionality. (In other words, we wouldn't say that governments shouldn't be able to offer government services through mobile apps, just not services that facilitate abuses.)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dana Ahmed, Saudi Arabia researcher for Amnesty International:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;We call on these companies to assess the risk of human rights abuses and mitigate harm that these apps may have on women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;This is another example of how the Saudi Arabian government has produced tools to limit women's freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;The tracking of women in this way curtails their movement and once again highlights the disturbing system of discrimination under the guardianship laws.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yasmine Mohammed, a former Muslim and a women's-rights activist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;There's a definite tragedy in the world's most technologically progressive platforms, Apple and Google, facilitating the most archaic misogyny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;What irony. In the West these technologies are used to improve lives and in Saudi Arabia they're used to enforce gender apartheid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisisinsider.com/absher-saudi-website-men-control-women-stop-escape-2019-1&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia runs a huge, sinister online database of women that men use to track them and stop them from running away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon is buying Eero</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/amazon-is-buying-home-mesh-router-startup-eero/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/amazon-is-buying-home-mesh-router-startup-eero/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Amazon is about to expand its smart home offerings in a big way. The company &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-acquire-eero-help-customers-better-connect-smart-home&quot;&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its intention to acquire Bay Area-based home mesh router startup, Eero. It’s a pretty clear fit for the online retailer as it pushes to make Alexa a feature in the connected home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The move also makes sense for five-year-old Eero, which, in spite of being early to the home mesh router game and pulling in some high-profile investors, has struggled. This time last year, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/wi-fi-startup-eero-lays-off-30-employees/&quot;&gt;laid off 30 employees&lt;/a&gt; — roughly one-fifth of its work force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Amazon’s certainly got the deep pockets, and the addition of Alexa to routers from Huawei and Netgear last year demonstrate that this category can be a viable one. It makes sense, as these coverage-extending mesh routers, like Echo Dots, are designed to be plugged into every room of the home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Amazon has been picking up a number of high-profile home automation startups in recent years, including Ring and Blink, as it looks to launch its own in-house Alexa smart home ecosystem. In many cases, Amazon has opted to retain the startups’ branding, which could bode well for the future of the Eero name — though the company admittedly doesn’t have the same sort of recognition as Ring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;“We are incredibly impressed with the eero team and how quickly they invented a WiFi solution that makes connected devices just work,” Amazon SVP Dave Limp said in a press release. “We have a shared vision that the smart home experience can get even easier, and we’re committed to continue innovating on behalf of customers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The deal is still waiting for all of the standard regulatory approval. Details of the acquisition have yet to be disclosed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NBC took Bob Costas off the Super Bowl for speaking out about concussions</title>
<link>http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/25914913/inside-story-how-legendary-nfl-broadcaster-bob-costas-ended-excised-football-nbc-espn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/25914913/inside-story-how-legendary-nfl-broadcaster-bob-costas-ended-excised-football-nbc-espn</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot; data-behavior=&quot;date_time&quot; data-date=&quot;2019-02-10T14:00:00Z&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-dateformat=&quot;date1&quot;&gt;Feb 10, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN DECEMBER 2015&lt;/strong&gt;, the movie &quot;Concussion&quot; was set for a Christmas Day release in nearly 3,000 theaters across America. The film told the story of the NFL's attempts to discredit research tying brain damage to football, and Bob Costas wanted to address it on national television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the previous decade, Costas had become the face of football on NBC, hosting one of TV's most-watched programs, &quot;Sunday Night Football.&quot; As part of every broadcast, Costas would take two minutes at halftime to speak directly to the program's 18 million viewers about the NFL issues of the day. Mostly, his commentaries were celebrations of the sport -- Brady vs. Manning, a tribute to Lambeau Field -- but, occasionally, he addressed subjects like gun control or the controversial name of the Washington, D.C., football team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his 28 Emmys and eight National Sportscaster of the Year awards, Costas had become the most-respected broadcaster of his generation -- a kind of Walter Cronkite for sports. He believed it was his responsibility to address uncomfortable truths, or &quot;elephants in the room,&quot; as he often called them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of &quot;Concussion&quot; seemed a natural topic given the nationwide awakening about head trauma in contact sports, especially the NFL. Costas believed it was important to have viewers confront football's existential crisis and consider their own moral dilemma as fans complicit to the sport's carnage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet he recognized such a speech posed a challenge for his bosses and NBC. The network was paying the NFL billions to air games on Sunday nights. Even more, Costas knew NBC executives were hoping to expand the network's NFL package to Thursdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas sent the essay to his bosses for approval, something he typically did not do -- and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would ensue that week -- and in the years that followed -- reveals for the first time how a broadcasting icon went from fronting America's most popular sport to being excised from last year's Super Bowl and, ultimately, ending his nearly 40-year career with NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the Lines spoke with the 66-year-old Costas dozens of times over the course of the past year. Those conversations provide not only the never-before-told backstory of how he became an NFL outsider, but also deep insight into his personality: the intelligence and self-assurance that have driven his career; the years-long struggle as he reconciled the celebration of a sport that enriched him financially and helped make him a broadcasting icon, but also weighed so heavily on his conscience; and the insecurity and intense worry -- near agony -- about the possibility of betraying his colleagues and friends by sharing his story. All of it points to the all-encompassing influence of the NFL -- even over the most distinguished broadcaster of his era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Costas wished he had never spoken to Outside the Lines about any of it: &quot;The upside is not equal to the fear I have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;At his career peak, Bob Costas was everywhere -- Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, Olympics, Kentucky Derby, golf, boxing, hockey, and on and on. NBC even created a talk show for him, &quot;Later,&quot; which lasted for seven seasons. &lt;cite&gt;NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY DECEMBER 2015,&lt;/strong&gt; nobody at NBC should have been surprised that Bob Costas would want to speak his mind about football. After joining the network at age 27 in 1979, he had become one of NBC's signature go-to voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol as his champion, Costas established himself as somebody who could do just about anything: play-by-play, commentary, hosting, interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was everywhere -- Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, Olympics, Kentucky Derby, golf, boxing, hockey, and on and on. NBC even created a talk show for him, &quot;Later,&quot; which lasted for seven seasons and displayed his interviewing talents. The diversity of people Costas interviewed over the years is mind-boggling, speaking to his intelligence and utility: From Johnny Cash to Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Tom Jones to Pierre Salinger, Gary Busey to Ozzy Osbourne, William Shatner to Charlton Heston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just that he was comfortable outside of sports, it's that he melded a near-photographic memory with a genuine interest and passion for pop culture, politics and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, the guy was not only talented, but he had just a great amount of credibility built up between hosting, play-by-play, studio work, his show -- remember, he hosted his own show!&quot; says Vince Wladika, who spent 11 years as a communications executive at Fox and NBC, working with Costas from 1989 to 1994. &quot;Between all that exposure, the audience trusted him. ... There was never an issue with Bob's willingness to speak his mind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wladika recalled an incident during the 1993 NBA Finals when Costas interviewed then-commissioner David Stern in the throes of gambling allegations involving Michael Jordan. The interview grew contentious, and as Costas pressed Stern about Jordan's alleged gambling debts, the commissioner snapped: &quot;How much money do you owe?&quot; To which Costas retorted, &quot;It doesn't matter. I don't represent the NBA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the interview ended, Costas says Ebersol expressed his displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dick would have preferred to give the league a little easier ride,&quot; Costas says. &quot;In the end, he always understood I had my view of things. In the big picture, we always worked it out, but there were times when I went off what they would have preferred was the script.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Costas says, was hardly unusual throughout his career at NBC -- though he and Ebersol remain close and Costas had nothing but glowing things to say about his mentor. Ebersol declined to be interviewed for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas told Outside the Lines that his credibility -- and, frankly, that of the network -- relied on his willingness to address hard topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few subjects are sacred to Costas, even his beloved baseball. Anyone who knows anything about Costas knows that he genuflects to the sport in ways that make non-baseball fans cringe. Still, Costas says he felt obligated to address the steroid scandal as it consumed the sport throughout the 2000s. &quot;A friend of mine said ... 'Whether it's news or sports, you can never go wrong being on the right side of history,'&quot; Costas says. &quot;I was right about steroids in baseball, and I was the only network broadcaster who even mentioned it. And I mentioned it all the damn time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he never heard from Major League Baseball executives or any of his bosses when he talked openly on MLB broadcasts about how the game's most hallowed records were being devalued as baseball's hierarchy stood by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were times, though, when Costas was seen as less aggressive. He hosted his first Olympics in 1992, in the midst of Juan Antonio Samaranch's 21-year run as IOC president. In 1996, journalist Frank Deford conducted a devastating interview of Samaranch for HBO's &quot;Real Sports,&quot; in which he confronted the Olympics chief about his ties to the fascist Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and the fact that he had honored Romanian tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu. In a New York Times piece about the interview, TV critic Richard Sandomir wrote: &quot;Nothing quite so controversial occurs Wednesday at 9 p.m. during 'Prelude to the Games,' the two-hour Olympic preview show produced by Sports Illustrated TV for NBC. Nothing harshly critical of the I.O.C., other Olympic organizations or sponsors is said on the special with Bob Costas as host.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Samaranch's ties to the dictators and why he didn't confront the topic, Costas told Outside the Lines: &quot;If I had interviewed Samaranch, I would have, but Samaranch did not appear for an interview with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas did, however, use the moment of the Ukrainian women's biathlon team taking gold in the 2014 Sochi Games as an opportunity to address Russia's intervention in the country, its &quot;hostile&quot; record on gay rights and its sponsorship of a vicious regime in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;After joining the network at age 27 in 1979, Costas quickly became one of the network's signature go-to voices. &lt;cite&gt;Focus on Sport/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN THE SPRING&lt;/strong&gt; of 2005, NBC, led by Ebersol, agreed to pay the NFL $600 million per year to televise its games on Sunday nights. The decision was a direct response to declining viewership, especially among the network's most sought-after demographic: men, age 18-49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC had fled the football arms race back in 1997, complaining that rights fees had risen out of control. Fox had drastically altered the landscape in 1993 when it agreed to pay nearly $400 million per year to air NFL games -- a move that left CBS, the league's original TV partner, out of the NFL package and had practically destroyed the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without the NFL, who could possibly exist? CBS almost proved nobody could,&quot; says former TV executive Rick Gentile, who was with CBS from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw coverage of some of the world's biggest sporting events, including several Super Bowls. &quot;As soon as we lost the NFL, we lost like 16 of our best [affiliate] stations to Fox. It was a devastating blow for the network, and it literally took years and years to pull out.&quot; In 1994, CBS balked at paying $295 million, he says, but when the network got another chance, it was &quot;'How much do you need? Here's the check, fill in the number.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2005, cognizant of CBS's free fall, NBC committed $3.6 billion over the coming six seasons to get back into the NFL fold. &quot;NBC Decides It Can't Live Without Football,&quot; declared a headline in The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Costas says he had sworn off the sport. He had hosted NBC's NFL pregame show for nearly a decade in the '80s and early '90s but asked to be taken off the broadcasts after the 1993 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I got closer and closer to the game, I became ambivalent about it,&quot; he says. &quot;The sheer violence of the game, and then the celebration of that violence, even before CTE became a specific issue ... I just didn't feel comfortable with that. That felt stupid to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas did host &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on HBO for six seasons beginning in 2002, but he says he justified that in his mind because the show provided autonomy to offer commentary and typically conveyed a level of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when NBC returned to football in 2005, Costas says Ebersol asked him to return as host and he agreed &quot;out of loyalty&quot; and &quot;as kind of a good soldier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, NBC would own Sunday nights, and Costas would become the emcee of &quot;Football Night in America,&quot; setting the tone for a five-hour broadcast every week. He had a reputation as a trustworthy and reasoned voice, someone who was willing to offer his opinion but not shout it out like a carnival barker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, his relationship with football was growing increasingly complicated. As evidence mounted tying the sport to brain disease, Costas says he felt compelled to talk about it. During Week 2 of the 2010 season, following a series of high-profile, concussion-related incidents, Costas presented his first essay about the topic to NBC viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline editorial float-r&quot; data-behavior=&quot;article_related&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.79498861047836&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.56&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;&amp;amp;lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:1&quot; href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/25776964/insurance-market-football-evaporating-causing-major-threat-nfl-pop-warner-colleges-espn&quot; class=&quot;img-link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2019/0117/r489927_2_806x806_1-1.jpg&amp;amp;w=130&amp;amp;h=130&amp;amp;scale=crop&amp;amp;location=center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the NFL to rec leagues, football is facing a stark new threat: An evaporating insurance market that is fundamentally altering the sport's economics, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.66666666666667&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;&amp;amp;lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:2&quot; href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25841974/nfl-says-concussions-238-percent-last-season&quot; class=&quot;img-link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2018/1007/r443761_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;amp;w=130&amp;amp;h=130&amp;amp;scale=crop&amp;amp;location=center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NFL says the number of concussion in practices and games dropped significantly in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Related&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;More and more is being learned about the now-undeniable link between concussions especially repeat concussions -- and subsequent problems with dementia, depression, early onset Alzheimer's, an entire array of serious medical problems stemming from an injury that is more common in football than in most other sports.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here's the truth,&quot; Costas said. &quot;America's most popular sport is a fundamentally dangerous game where the risk of catastrophic injury is not incidental, it is significant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a decisive moment in the history of football in America. Here was the preeminent voice of televised sports, looking straight into the camera, telling millions of fans who tuned in that he, they -- all of us -- were essentially complicit in the human destruction caused by a gladiator sport. Equally surreal -- but unstated -- was the fact that even as Costas was describing the problem as &quot;undeniable,&quot; the NFL was publicly denying any link between football and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing years, as research accumulated, Costas became more emboldened. His blend of humor, wit and unfiltered opinion was gold on the talk-show circuit -- from CNN to Bill Maher to NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show -- as well as to anyone who wanted to discuss the dangers of football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, in a conversation with Robert Lipsyte of The New York Times, he told an audience, &quot;The game is unacceptably brutal. Can I say it any more clearly than that it is unacceptably brutal?&quot; Two years later, on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; he said, &quot;The way football is currently played in the NFL is fundamentally unsustainable.&quot; And the following year, on &quot;The Last Word,&quot; he called the sport &quot;inherently violent and brutal&quot; and suggested that head trauma could lead to off-field criminal conduct by some players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he never heard from anyone with the NFL complaining about his statements, nor does he say his bosses at NBC protested or suggested they had ever been contacted by league officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentile, the former CBS executive, says it wouldn't surprise him that Costas never received complaints from the NFL -- because the league officials always called Gentile and not the broadcaster himself when they had concerns. Still, Gentile says, the NFL was &quot;never really dictatorial, at least in my lifetime.&quot; It was nothing like, for example, the network's relationship with The Masters, which kept intense pressure on CBS by signing only one-year contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was that The Masters could force the network to banish Gary McCord from the broadcast for describing Augusta National's speedy greens as &quot;bikini-waxed,&quot; or Jack Whitaker for referring to a &quot;mob&quot; of fans on the 18th green at the end of a playoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentile, though, understands why the NFL might have become more controlling over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's an existential issue,&quot; says Gentile, who also is the director of the Seton Hall University Sports Poll, which conducts regular surveys on sports-related issues. &quot;The NFL is faced with this looming head-injury issue. We conducted polls at Seton Hall and you could see the numbers go up of parents who didn't want their kids to play football. That doesn't speak well to the future, so I think there's a strong sensitivity there [from the NFL]. This is, 'Do we exist or not.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And it's just as important to the networks that the NFL continue to be the NFL.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the more Costas talked definitively about the connection between football and brain damage, the more it created tension between him, his bosses and the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was bound to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas attended a 2015 screening of &quot;Concussion&quot; and was moved by the film's portrayal of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who first posited that former NFL players had died with a brain disease caused by football. &lt;cite&gt;Andrew Toth/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO UNDERSTAND THE&lt;/strong&gt; symbiotic relationships between the television networks and the NFL requires acknowledging the obvious: An undeniable power imbalance exists. The NFL -- like other leagues -- has several options to air games and highlights, from the Big Three networks to ESPN and a variety of cable venues -- and now Facebook, Google, Amazon and other developing media. But there's only one NFL, and only so many games to go around. The result is a financial windfall for the league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL took in more than $7 billion from its television partners this season. By 2027, according to a USA Today report citing the sports analytics firm Navigate Research, that number could hit $17 billion -- meaning each of the league's 32 teams would pocket more than a half-billion dollars from TV every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ESPN, the network is in the middle of a contract that pays the NFL $1.9 billion per year to air Monday Night Football, a deal set to expire in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are partnerships, but they tilt heavily toward the league's Park Avenue offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas: &quot;Look, the NFL isn't just the most important sports property, it's the single-most important property in all of American television. And it isn't even close.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the stakes, the NFL has enormous influence over how networks portray the sport. When a broadcaster like Costas goes rogue, or investigative reporting touches on sensitive issues like concussions or politics, tensions inevitably surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tensions have surfaced at ESPN, which famously cancelled its popular 2003 series Playmakers after only one season following complaints from the NFL. Outside the Lines' yearslong reporting on football's concussion crisis has led to numerous complaints from the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, ESPN abruptly ended a partnership with PBS's award-winning program &quot;Frontline&quot; on &quot;League of Denial,&quot; a documentary that explored the NFL's two-decade effort to deny and rewrite the science connecting football and brain disease. After ESPN pulled out of the deal, The New York Times published a story that suggested the network had bowed to pressure from the NFL. ESPN denied it, saying it dropped out over lack of &quot;editorial control.&quot; ESPN ended up running excerpts from the film and a companion book, as planned, and it continues to cover the concussion issue to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas: &quot;The networks, all of them, dance to the NFL's tune. It's just kind of the way it goes. Everyone walks on eggshells around the NFL.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas and his mentor and friend, former NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol. &lt;cite&gt;Robin Platzer/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN 2015, COSTAS&lt;/strong&gt; was invited to a November screening of &quot;Concussion&quot; in Hollywood. He was moved by the film and even thought Will Smith might earn an Oscar nod for his performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who had ignited the NFL's concussion crisis a decade earlier by first positing that former players had died with a brain disease caused by football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC was scheduled to air Indianapolis at Pittsburgh on Dec. 6. The movie was set largely in Pittsburgh, and former Steelers great Mike Webster was a major character in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a natural lead-in,&quot; Costas told Outside the Lines. &quot;I thought that the movie would make an impact, and I thought this was a way not only for NBC to acknowledge it, but to get out in front of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas typically wrote his essays on the fly on game day, sometimes even as the first quarter of the Sunday night matchup was under way. This time, though, he wrote it in advance to give his bosses an early look, recognizing it could create problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay, which has never been made public but was provided to Outside the Lines, began with a description of Omalu as &quot;the neuropathologist who clearly demonstrated what just about everybody now understands -- but which for years the league denied: There is a direct and often tragic link between football and brain damage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he sought to mitigate the potential embarrassment for the NFL by highlighting its efforts to improve player safety. &quot;I purposely toned it down,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote, &quot;To its credit, the NFL now has put millions into medical research and the possibility of improving equipment. They have instituted rules changes aimed at making the game safer, awareness programs aimed at youth football, and stricter head trauma protocols, which, even if they don't always work, at least appear to be a step in the right direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Costas didn't hold back: &quot;Even as the ratings rise, so, too, does a certain ambivalence. Because as much as we may try to push it into the background, there's a kind of Russian roulette going on on the field tonight and on our television screens throughout the fall and winter, since we know that for all the game's appeal, many of its participants will one day pay dearly for their part in our national obsession.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he submitted the essay to Ebersol's successor, NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus, and executive producer Sam Flood and awaited their response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember the reaction almost verbatim. They said, 'This is a very well-written piece, wouldn't change a comma. We can't air it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he asked why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're in negotiations with the NFL for Thursday Night Football,&quot; he says he was told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was at that point that I realized that this was an untenable situation for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I knew my days there were numbered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazarus and Flood did not respond to requests seeking comment for this story. An NBC spokesman provided a statement that read, &quot;We have historically given our commentators a lot of leeway to speak on our air about issues and controversies, and Bob has benefited most from this policy. We're very disappointed that after 40 years with NBC, he has chosen to mischaracterize and share these private interactions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before he offered the &quot;Concussion&quot; essay, the tension had ratcheted up between Costas and the network. At the start of the season, the NFL had introduced an ad campaign called &quot;Football is Family.&quot; The spots were designed, in part, to counter negative publicity that had come to surround the league, especially around head trauma. One ad showed female fans wearing their favorite team gear, working out, drinking coffee, taking walks with their similarly decked-out children; another had Packers running back Eddie Lacy mowing the lawns of fans who lived near Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the divisional playoffs rolled around -- less than two months after his &quot;Concussion&quot; essay was killed -- Costas had had enough. In speaking with Bob Raissman of the New York Daily News, he said of the league's promotion: &quot;It's a little much to take, while watching a game, that you are constantly bombarded with 'Football is Family' [commercials].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described to Raissman the significant number of players &quot;acting like creeps and criminals&quot; and concluded with, &quot;You see all this stuff and the first thing that comes to mind is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a Norman Rockwell painting. Yes, 'Football is Family.' Bring out the hearts and the tinkling piano music, because it really is a touching tableau.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long for Costas to hear from his bosses: Why did he need to take such a gratuitous potshot at NBC's biggest business partner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My response was, 'The purpose of it is so I can sleep at night,' you know?&quot; he told Outside the Lines. &quot;Some of this is like blinking in a hostage video. It's like, 'You know I sort of have to do this. I hope you get what I'm really thinking right now.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after Costas' &quot;Concussion&quot; essay was rejected and two weeks after he ridiculed the &quot;Football is Family&quot; ads, the NFL announced a contract with NBC to air five Thursday night games in each of the following two seasons. NBC would pay the league another $450 million -- or $45 million per game -- to share the broadcast rights and simulcast the games on the league's own NFL Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;When NBC returned to football in 2005, Costas agreed to return as host &quot;out of loyalty&quot; and &quot;as kind of a good soldier&quot; to NBC. Over the next decade, NBC would own Sunday nights, and Costas would become the emcee of &quot;Football Night in America.&quot; &lt;cite&gt;AP Photo/Matt Rourke&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY THE TIME&lt;/strong&gt; NBC was officially signing its new deal, Costas says he had invoked a clause in his contract that would allow him to step away from football and the Olympics to take on an emeritus role. He would host one more season on Sunday nights and then turn the show over to Mike Tirico. Costas' NFL swan song would be Feb. 4, 2018, when NBC next aired the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three months before the Super Bowl, the plan imploded during one dramatic week. First, on Nov. 7, 2017, Costas appeared at a journalism symposium at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, he told a crowd of more than 400, &quot;The issue [in sports] that is most substantial -- the existential issue -- is the nature of football itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then went on a nearly one-and-a-half minute riff about football and brain damage that was punctuated by this statement: &quot;The reality is that this game destroys people's brains -- not everyone's, but a substantial number. It's not a small number, it's a considerable number. It destroys their brains.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two nights later, Costas was honored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation -- an advocacy group affiliated with researchers who have been at the forefront of the science connecting football and brain disease. Costas accepted the award from CLF to a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, Costas' line at Maryland -- &lt;em&gt;This game destroys people's brains&lt;/em&gt; -- had gone viral, raising hackles in the NBC offices. The New York Daily News asked NBC for comment, and a spokesman responded, &quot;Bob's opinions are his own, and they do not represent those of the NBC Sports Group&quot; -- prompting a story from Raissman under the headline, &quot;NBC throws Bob Costas under the bus and in the process sends warning to rest of its talent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing a budding problem with his employer, Costas says he decided to appear on CNN on Saturday morning to make it clear he wasn't being critical of NBC. So, for the third time in a week, Costas was talking publicly about football and brain damage. He didn't soften any of his comments -- in fact, he reiterated them -- but he did attempt to defend the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been saying these things for the better part of a decade, and often on NBC, in front of the biggest audience not just in all of sports, but in all of television -- 'Sunday Night Football,'&quot; Costas told host Michael Smerconish. &quot;And I think NBC Sports deserves credit for this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within an hour, Costas says he received a text from Flood, who oversees sports production for NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the words were, 'You've crossed the line,'&quot; says Costas, who says he no longer has the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My thought was, 'What line have I crossed?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Costas says he pointed out that he had been saying these things about football for years -- often on NBC. That didn't matter; it seemed this was one time too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas was told he was off the Super Bowl LII broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I recall the phrase, 'It's a six-hour, daylong celebration of football, and you're not the right person to celebrate football,'&quot; Costas says. &quot;To which my response was not, 'Oh please, please, change your mind.' My response was, 'Yeah, I guess you're right.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas insists that rather than being upset or feeling punished, he felt relief. Still, he says he and NBC recognized that pulling him off the Super Bowl would raise questions. Costas had a proposal: He should interview Roger Goodell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was looking out not only for myself, because I'd like to do the interview, but I was also looking out for NBC because that would have taken them off the public relations hook and eliminated all the confusion about them supposedly kicking me to the curb or throwing me under the bus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says Lazarus and Flood told him they would check with the NFL. The answer came back quickly: Goodell wouldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know how far they went,&quot; Costas says, positing that they could have demurred without argument &quot;as opposed to what you could say, which is this: 'Hey, we pay you guys billions of dollars, and 99 percent of what we do celebrates and promotes the league. Don't you have some obligation to us here? It's our year in the three-year Super Bowl cycle.' I don't know if that kind of pushback took place.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he had asked to interview Goodell before Super Bowl XLIX but been rebuffed then, too. This was not the norm across all sports. Costas says he had regularly interviewed league commissioners during their championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It tells you who calls the shots,&quot; Costas says. &quot;The only business arrangement I can think of where the buyer must continually flatter the seller is the sports TV business. 'We're pulling a Brinks armored truck up to Park Avenue, Mr. Goodell. It contains the billions of dollars that we're going to pay you for the right and privilege to televise your games. But if we've delivered them in a denomination that does not please you, we're terribly sorry, we'll back the truck up, and we'll bring it to you in 20s and 50s if that's the way you'd prefer it.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Outside the Lines in an email that, often, each network airing the Super Bowl asks for an interview with the commissioner. &quot;Commissioner Goodell has done one sit-down interview in the last five years with the network airing the Super Bowl,&quot; says McCarthy. &quot;That was for the 50th Super Bowl in 2016. Commissioner Goodell has not done an interview with NBC for the four Super Bowls it has aired since he has been commissioner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy says the NFL did not ask NBC to remove Costas from the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days before the Super Bowl, when NBC first revealed that Costas wouldn't be part of the coverage, statements released by the network suggested that he wasn't doing the game in deference to Liam McHugh and Dan Patrick, who had served as &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; hosts throughout the season. Costas was quoted: &quot;It wouldn't be right for me to parachute in and do the Super Bowl&quot; -- even though that had been precisely the plan before things went awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, in an email to Sports Business Daily, Costas wrote, &quot;The decision was mutually agreeable, and not only do I not have a problem with it, I am actually happy about it. I have long had ambivalent feelings about football, so at this point, it's better to leave the hosting to those who are more enthusiastic about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was only partially true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas now: &quot;I was hoping that the whole thing wouldn't cause a stir. And what I said was true as far as it went. I was completely comfortable with it, I had no personal stake in hosting, I was happy football was in my rearview mirror.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his statements to Sports Business Daily, he had also dismissed any suggestion that his comments at Maryland had prompted NBC to pull him from the game. He wrote about how he had been making these same kinds of comments about football for a long time, &quot;So the idea that I am only now finding my voice on this, or that NBC was taken aback by what I said at Maryland is just wrong. It's all simple and straightforward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas is the only person to win sports, news and entertainment Emmy Awards. &lt;cite&gt;Marc Bryan-Brown/WireImage&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN DECEMBER, COSTAS&lt;/strong&gt; was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. At the ceremony, he singled out Lazarus and Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Lazarus, he said, &quot;If there is a better, more reasonable person in a prominent position in network sports than Mark Lazarus, I haven't met him or her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing surprising about this. For the better part of a year, during dozens of conversations with Outside the Lines -- short ones, long ones, in person, on the phone -- Costas made a point of noting how, in spite of everything he was saying, he had no issues with anyone at NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Toward the end, I was something of a square peg in a round hole,&quot; he said during his induction speech, a phrase he had used repeatedly with Outside the Lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was surprising about Costas was not that he was concerned that he might offend anyone at NBC, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; concerned he was. Over the past few months, rarely did a conversation take place without Outside the Lines having to reassure Costas that the story would reflect his respect and admiration for his colleagues, and that he held no ill will toward them or NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it didn't seem to matter. The conversations would end, Costas would appear to trust the process, and then, days or weeks later, it was like Groundhog Day and the same conversation would occur again. Costas also was concerned with what internet trolls and commenters might say about him after they read the story. Asked why he cared so much when it was clear he couldn't satisfy everyone, Costas replied, &quot;I guess I find unfairness or untruth annoying.&quot; He had suggestions for how to phrase and contextualize certain elements of the piece, and he regularly lamented that some people might perceive him as bitter -- again, despite regular assurances that the story would not reflect him as bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting on Costas revealed not only his mixed feelings about revisiting the more difficult portion of his career, but also NBC's reaction to him making it public. NBC declined to license ESPN its footage involving Costas in a video version of this story that aired on E:60. Costas repeatedly suggested that Outside the Lines reach out to his longtime NBC producer and one of his closest friends, Bruce Cornblatt, saying he would be an excellent resource who would be happy to talk. Cornblatt, though, did not respond to calls and, ultimately, sent a text saying he declined to comment; asked why, Cornblatt didn't respond. Outside the Lines asked an NBC spokesman whether Cornblatt had been told not to cooperate, and the spokesman denied that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Costas says he regretted ever taking part in the story; not because he regretted his comments about football, but because of the strain it created around his relationships with NBC colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, it reflected something Costas said in one fashion or another during several conversations with Outside the Lines: As much as he cherished his time at NBC, he and the network simply had reached a point of divergent interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am not a Howard Cosell at the end of his career deciding he doesn't like boxing,&quot; Costas says. &quot;I decided long ago that I had misgivings about football, and I tried to use the forum they gave me to make those points. They gave me bits and pieces, but eventually they took those bits and pieces away from me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Costas had decided he wanted to stop hosting Super Bowls and Olympics, the plan was to take on an emeritus role that would have him appearing to host or offer commentary on select major events or programs. Instead, Costas and NBC agreed to terms this past fall to end his contract early. Costas had said at one point that he expected a joint announcement in January, with both sides releasing statements that described their mutual respect and admiration. Instead, the news trickled out when Costas confirmed it to the New York Post in a Jan. 19 story headlined, &quot;Bob Costas and NBC are quietly and officially broken up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's very fair and very amicable,&quot; Costas told Outside the Lines. &quot;It was a very, very fruitful run of nearly four decades, and I have nothing but respect and appreciation for all of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Lubbers, a producer in ESPN's enterprise and investigative unit, and Julia Theaman, a content associate for Outside the Lines and E:60, contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/google-docs-gets-an-api-for-task-automation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; today announced the general availability of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/&quot;&gt;new API for Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow developers to automate many of the tasks that users typically do manually in the company’s online office suite. The API has been in developer preview since last April’s Google Cloud Next 2018 and is now available to all developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Google notes, the REST API was designed to help developers build workflow automation services for their users, build content management services and create documents in bulk. Using the API, developers can also set up processes that manipulate documents &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/batchUpdate&quot;&gt;after the fact&lt;/a&gt; to update them, and the API also features the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/move-text&quot;&gt;insert, delete, move&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/merge&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/format-text&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; text, insert inline images and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/lists&quot;&gt;work with lists&lt;/a&gt;, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1781059&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Zapier-GIF_V2_AC.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;853&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canonical use case here is invoicing, where you need to regularly create similar documents with ever-changing order numbers and line items based on information from third-party systems (or maybe even just a Google Sheet). Google also notes that the API’s import/export abilities allow you to use Docs for internal content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies that built solutions based on the new API during the preview period include Zapier, Netflix, Mailchimp and Final Draft. Zapier integrated the Docs API into its own workflow automation tool to help its users create offer letters based on a template, for example, while Netflix used it to build an internal tool that helps its engineers gather data and automate its documentation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What&amp;#039;s next for SemVer</title>
<link>https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-02-11&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;February 11, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2009&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Semantic Versioning specification was announced. More commonly known as SemVer, it provided guidance for developers regarding software versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this system “Semantic Versioning.” Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author came from the Ruby world, and around the same time, some big things were brewing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; was being brought into the world. Bundler brought a few new things, but the most important features involved specifying dependencies for your projects. Normally, you’d specify which version of a gem your project needed. Instead, Bundler allowed you to specify a range of versions you’d accept, and it would help figure out which version you should use, according to the SemVer rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2010, npm, a similar program for the shiny new Node.js, also shipped, and also used SemVer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these tools, Ruby and Node enjoyed (and still do, to this day) a vibrant open source ecosystem. SemVer is the underlying concept that made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, SemVer is not perfect. In some ways, I think of SemVer as the &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; of versioning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot; readability=&quot;5.2413793103448&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gofmt’s style is no one’s favorite, yet gofmt is everyone’s favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SemVer has its flaws, but it empirically works better than previous attempts at such a thing. That such a thing exists is far more important than how perfect it is. Fundamentally, version numbers are a communication tool, and SemVer provides a framework for said communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, SemVer &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have flaws. Bundler, &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, Rust’s Cargo, NuGet, and a variety of tools have implemented the specification. But there are edge cases, as well as gaping holes, in the spec, and so in some ways, these tools are incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, several of us&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have been talking, and today, we have an announcement to make. We’ve formed a semver team, and we intend to start work on producing a new version of the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is “we”? The team roster will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/semver/teams/maintainers/members&quot;&gt;in a GitHub team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but for posterity’s sake, here’s the initial list of members, in the same order GitHub lists them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anand Gaurav, NuGet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Herman, Notion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;André Arko, Bundler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isaacs, npm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samuel Giddins, CocoaPods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Klabnik, Cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I’m putting myself as “Cargo,” because Cargo is the main client of my SemVer implementation. In most of these projects, the person who maintains the SemVer implementation is the same as the project, but in Rust, they’re separate. Cargo is the higher-order bit here, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not yet started the work on the next iteration of the specification, but we have agreed on a governance model for SemVer. Described in the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/semver/semver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re going with an RFC process, similar to the Rust programming language and many other projects. In short, “substantial” changes to the SemVer spec need to go through a process by which a written description of the changes are proposed, and the team reaches consensus on acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also contains some principles we have for the future of SemVer. I’ve copied the important ones for the specification itself here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No RFC will be approved if it is deemed to cause significant breakage to any of the SemVer-using communities represented by the SemVer Maintainers group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFCs will be considered formally adopted only when they are approved by the SemVer Maintainers group, and implemented in a simple majority of represented implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementations may add functionality in advance of an approved RFC but all such functionality must be flagged as “experimental”, so that users understand it may change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, we don’t intend to re-write the spec, but instead, fill in holes in the spec, find out where our implementations differ, and unify all of our implementations as much as is feasible. We believe that this will not only help all of us, but also help new tools as well. Being compatible with each other is an important part of the value of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to letting you know when our work is done! If you’d like to get involved, please watch that governance repository, and submit RFCs! While we’re all excited about the future of SemVer, it’s nobody’s job to do this work. As such, we’ll be moving fairly slowly. Please be patient. Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://haacked.com/archive/2019/02/11/semver-collective/&quot;&gt;Phil’s post&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on this transition from the other side. Thanks for being so much of a good steward of SemVer so far, Phil!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;410&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;410&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2019-5736: runc container breakout (all versions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt;: Aleksa Sarai &amp;lt;cyphar () cyphar com&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Date&lt;/em&gt;: Tue, 12 Feb 2019 00:05:20 +1100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
[[        Patch CRD: 2019-02-11 15:00 CET ]]
[[ Exploit Code CRD: 2019-02-18 15:00 CET ]]

Hello,

I am one of the maintainers of runc (the underlying container runtime
underneath Docker, cri-o, containerd, Kubernetes, and so on). We
recently had a vulnerability reported which we have verified and have a
patch for.

The researchers who found this vulnerability are:
  * Adam Iwaniuk
  * Borys Popławski

In addition, Aleksa Sarai (me) discovered that LXC was also vulnerable
to a more convoluted version of this flaw.

== OVERVIEW ==

The vulnerability allows a malicious container to (with minimal user
interaction) overwrite the host runc binary and thus gain root-level
code execution on the host. The level of user interaction is being able
to run any command (it doesn't matter if the command is not
attacker-controlled) as root within a container in either of these
contexts:

  * Creating a new container using an attacker-controlled image.
  * Attaching (docker exec) into an existing container which the
    attacker had previous write access to.

This vulnerability is *not* blocked by the default AppArmor policy, nor
by the default SELinux policy on Fedora[++] (because container processes
appear to be running as container_runtime_t). However, it *is* blocked
through correct use of user namespaces (where the host root is not
mapped into the container's user namespace).

Our CVSSv3 vector is (with a score of 7.2):

  AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

The assigned CVE for this issue is CVE-2019-5736.

[++]: This is only the case for the &quot;moby-engine&quot; package on Fedora. The
          &quot;docker&quot; package as well as podman are protected against this
          exploit because they run container processes as container_t.

== PATCHES ==

I have attached the relevant patch which fixes this issue. This patch is
based on HEAD, but the code in libcontainer/nsenter/ changes so
infrequently that it should apply cleanly to any old version of the runc
codebase you are dealing with.

Please note that the patch I have pushed to runc master[1] is a modified
version of this patch -- even though it is functionally identical
(though we would recommend using the upstream one if you haven't patched
using the attached one already).

== NON-ESSENTIAL EXPLOIT CODE ==

Several vendors have asked for exploit code to ensure that the patches
actually solve the issue. Due to the severity of the issue (especially
for public cloud vendors), we decided to provide the attached exploit
code. This exploit code was written by me, and is more generic than the
original exploit code provided by the researchers and works against LXC
(it could likely be used on other vulnerable runtimes with no
significant modification). Details on how to use the exploit code are
provided in the README.

As per OpenWall rules, this exploit code will be published *publicly* 7
days after the CRD (which is 2019-02-18). *If you have a container
runtime, please verify that you are not vulnerable to this issue
beforehand.*

== IMPACT ON OTHER PROJECTS ==

It should be noted that upon further investigation I've discovered that
LXC has a similar vulnerability, and they have also pushed a similar
patch[2] which we co-developed. LXC is a bit harder to exploit, but the
same fundamental flaw exists.

After some discussion with the systemd-nspawn folks, it appears that
they aren't vulnerable (because their method of attaching to a container
uses a different method to LXC and runc).

I have been contacted by folks from Apache Mesos who said they were also
vulnerable (I believe just using the exploit code that will be
provided). It is quite likely that most container runtimes are
vulnerable to this flaw, unless they took very strange mitigations
before-hand.

== OTHER NEWS ==

We have set up an announcement list for future security vulnerabilities,
and you can see the process for joining here[3] (it's based on the
Kubernetes security-announce mailing list). Please join if you
distribute any container runtimes that depend on runc (or other OCI
projects).

<title>Cheap and simple medical devices have to overcome deeply rooted biases</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;177&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At less than the price of a cup of coffee, it might be one of the world’s most economical lifesaving devices. The “uterine balloon tamponade” does not look like much: a syringe, some blue tubing, a lubricated condom. All this is contained in a plastic bag, along with a checklist and a laminated set of instructions. But, when the condom is attached to the end of a catheter and inflated with water, it can stop uterine bleeding in women who have just given birth—one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in developing countries. “I get pictures every day from women—in India, in Kenya, in Tanzania—from women who have survived,” Thomas Burke tells me, holding up his phone, as we sit in the living room of his house in the Boston suburbs. “We’ve heard it called the miracle device.” In his basement are boxes containing thousands of the kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade ago, Burke, an emergency physician who heads the Division of Global Health Innovation at Massachusetts General Hospital, was in South Sudan, where he and a team of doctors had been tasked with setting up programs to improve maternal and newborn health. Complications from pregnancy were at the top of the list. “There are places on earth where between one in six and one in eight women lose their life because of pregnancy,” Burke says. Ninety-nine per cent of new mothers globally who die do so in “resource-poor settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of maternal deaths in developing countries—and one in three of all maternal deaths—are caused by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), in which the uterus, often fatigued after hours of labor, bleeds uncontrollably. Few of the standard medical responses to PPH—uterotonic drugs, interventional radiology, even hysterectomies—were readily available in the fledgling, conflict-ravaged Republic of South Sudan, so Burke and his colleagues shifted their attention to uterine balloons, a simple mechanism that compresses against the source of the bleeding and helps activate the body’s own clotting response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the typical uterine balloon can cost upward of three hundred dollars. Burke had learned about a lower-cost, unregulated UBT—sometimes dubbed Sayeba’s method, after Sayeba Akhter, the Bangladeshi doctor often credited with coming up with the idea, in 2000—constructed from a standard catheter and a condom. Burke and his colleagues wondered if there was a middle ground between the medical-grade balloons and the ad-hoc condom-catheter device. Back in Boston, he began “walking through the aisles of Home Depot, just wandering around our hospital,” looking for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burke is under no illusion of having reinvented the wheel. “This is just about taking some low-cost things that are right in front of us and assembling them in a—people often say, a ‘MacGyver’ fashion,” he told me, with a gently derisive snort. He made some design refinements—like adding a one-way valve to make sure the condom stayed inflated—but the real innovation was presenting the device as a package, a self-contained kit with easily replaced parts and, important in regions where health-care workers often can’t read, graphically rendered instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the E.S.M.-UBT—E.S.M. stands for “Every Second Matters”—has been deployed many thousands of times, in countries from Peru to Zambia. The survival rate of women who received it—many of whom are in advanced or even end-stage shock—is ninety-seven per cent over all, according to numbers compiled by Massachusetts General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a rural medical college in Sevagram, India, founded by Gandhi’s personal physician, the UBT has helped save hundreds of lives. It has also lowered costs by reducing the number of hysterectomies and blood transfusions, and the hospital is now working on producing its own UBT kits. This imitation is, Burke says, the whole point: “In India, the government keeps saying, ‘Dr. Burke has been so kind to give us his patent.’ I keep saying, ‘There &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no patent, this is yours, go for it!’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UBT is just one in a series of low-cost medical technologies that Burke and his colleagues hope to disseminate.These devices may not rise to the absolute gold standard of care but they are just good enough—particularly when lives hang in the balance. Their use is most obvious and immediate for doctors in developing countries working with immense constraints and high stakes; but is there a lesson here for wealthier countries, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practicing emergency physician, Burke long ago learned the art and science of making do. He carries a medical kit with him at all times and has inserted breathing tubes for the victims of car crashes where he happened to be on the scene; once, at a rural hospital in Uganda, he consulted an old British military surgery guide—he isn’t a surgeon—to treat abdominal bleeding. And he has a curious propensity for witnessing historic events, from the standoffs at Ruby Ridge and Waco to the attacks in Benghazi. When I first met him, during his stint as the onboard physician for a round-the-world expedition, he had recently dealt with a midtrip heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in emergency medicine often joke “that you can figure out a solution with a couple of popsicle sticks. It may not be the ideal tool, but you can muddle through,” Burke says. Through low-cost, research-backed innovations, Burke wants to take that popsicle-stick thinking and do more than muddle through, to help transition from “crisis to long-term strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His is a bottom-up approach in a world accustomed to top-down solutions. When it comes to health care, Burke says, “you can go to almost any hospital in the world in a poor setting, and you can see piles of technologies that have been presented from do-gooders.” But, without the right supply chains or technical support, such “upstream” solutions quickly surrender to a sort of reverse obsolescence, outmoded less by the future than by the weight of history. An emphasis on bringing in the latest technology is often misguided. There are some cases where ultrasound machines, for example, are essential, but, Burke says, “we’ve not been able to show that ultrasound during pregnancy changes population-level outcomes of newborns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than wait for expensive technologies to become more affordable, or to be helicoptered in by well-meaning relief agencies, Burke shapes his approach by observing what is actually being used on the ground and trying to create a set of best practices. Millions of babies worldwide, for example, Burke says, need oxygen support in the first year of life. But &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;CPAP&lt;/em&gt; machines, the standard device in a country like the U.S., are expensive and require uninterrupted electricity. In many countries, Burke says, doctors resort to using a makeshift solution: a Coke bottle filled with water and attached to some tubing. The D.I.Y. approach can save an infant’s life but risks causing blindness. Burke took this simple yet flawed idea and improved it, designing the E.S.M.-&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;CPAP&lt;/em&gt;, which is comparable to its high-tech equivalent but costs around thirty dollars. Like the UBT, it comes with a simple how-to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take ketamine—known to many people in the West, if at all, as a recreational narcotic. Burke had long been aware of the semi-underground use of ketamine as an emergency anesthetic—he himself administered it at Ruby Ridge. Ketamine works, he says, because it “scrambles you”: “It’s a dissociative drug—it literally dissociates you from the stimulus that is happening, even the world that you and I live in.” It’s not a perfect anesthetic—for one, it’s not a muscle relaxant—but it doesn’t require expensive machinery, or a trained professional to insure a patient keeps breathing. One recent study found that Ethiopia, a country of eighty million people, had only nineteen anesthesiologists. Ketamine costs a few cents a dose and has now become an ad-hoc, unregulated alternative throughout the world. In Kenya, some eighteen hundred documented surgeries under ketamine have been performed, with no attributable deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As word of Burke’s practice spread, via a journal article, something curious happened. A doctor from a Canadian hospital that sometimes suffered from a shortage of trained anesthesiologists got in touch with Burke, wanting to know more about the technique. A few months later, a team of Canadian doctors and nurses travelled to Kenya to observe surgical procedures performed under ketamine. The typically rigid flow of knowledge and resources so often seen in global medicine seemed finally ready to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;158.83837813418&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, researchers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, began administering a solution of glucose and salts to patients suffering from severe cholera-related dehydration. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was a revelation in pediatric health, helping to stem an epidemic in children’s deaths from diarrhea—from an estimated five million deaths per year in 1968 to between four hundred thousand and six hundred and sixty thousand in 2016. &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Lancet,&lt;/em&gt; in 1978, called ORT “potentially the most important medical advance this century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, the standard treatment for diarrhea was to administer an intravenous fluid, a costly procedure requiring hospitalization. ORT—which basically amounts to drinking Pedialyte—costs just several cents a dose and can be administered anywhere by anyone, yet the magic bullet was resisted by many doctors. As Joshua Nalibow Ruxin, a public-health researcher and entrepreneur, noted in the journal &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Medical History&lt;/em&gt;, it had to overcome deep institutional bias: “Intravenous therapy appeared more scientific, there was an apparatus, and the physician could have precise control over the intake of a patient.” It took until 1992 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to declare it the favored treatment for children with diarrhea in the U.S., and its use in high-income countries remains low. One possible reason? Hospitals get bigger reimbursements when they use I.V.s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ORT is a classic case of what has been called “reverse innovation”: taking a technology or solution born of the resource constraints in developing countries and adopting it in wealthier ones. For many, it’s one of the most promising avenues for improving performance and lowering health-care costs. For the U.S., these are pressing goals: a 2012 study looking at health care in the most industrialized nations placed the U.S. near the bottom in almost every ranking. One of the few categories where it’s ranked first is cost: for these sub-stellar outcomes, U.S. citizens had the privilege of paying, on average, twice as much for health care as citizens of other countries in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reverse innovation can be a hard sell in the U.S. First, there’s entrenched cultural bias: How can we learn something from a place we are sending our expertise &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;? The very term “reverse innovation,” some suggest, merely reinforces this schema of knowledge transfer. And then there’s the lack of incentives. As Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, argues, the U.S. health-care system lacks a strong central price-setting mechanism and exists in a highly uncompetitive market. If someone shows up with a “nice and cheap way of doing something, most hospitals are going to be skeptical: Why would they want something cheap if it’s going to lower their reimbursement?” And, even if the maker of a low-cost medical innovation were to get through the costly process of F.D.A. approval, it would then have to compete with manufacturers of more expensive products and try to sell to busy doctors with little interest in cheap solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high hurdles do not mean people are not trying. Arbutus Medical, a Canadian startup, was founded after a medical team working in Uganda observed local surgeons using cheap hardware-store drills—rather than traditional, clinical drills, which can cost upward of thirty thousand dollars—wrapped in unsterile towels. The team fashioned a better, sterile version of the drill cover that, attached to a DeWalt drill, is more than ninety per cent cheaper. The device was originally intended for low-resource settings but has attracted interest from the Canadian and U.S. military, and hospitals in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. are considering trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Clayton Christensen’s famous model of “disruptive innovation,” a lower-cost, initially lower-quality product goes on to conquer an established market dominated by higher-cost, higher-quality products. Digital cameras kill off Kodak, and Netflix runs Blockbuster into the ground. But health care in wealthier countries has been largely immune to this kind of disruption. Some of this makes sense—pricey drugs persist, at least in part, because of high research-and-development costs—but for the actual machinery of medical care, it’s harder to explain. &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/31/17629526/mri-cost-certificate-of-need-north-carolina-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Take MRIs&lt;/a&gt;. As Harvard’s Jha notes, MRIs are nineteen-eighties technology: “Sure, they’ve gotten marginally better over time, but the price keeps going up.” Medicine, it seems, is a unique beast. People may be pleased to see the price of flat-screen TVs drop, but they aren’t necessarily comforted to see the cost of medicine decline. As Jha puts it, “Do I really want a cheap version of X, because, hey, it’s my mom you’re talking about—plus insurance is paying for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even comparing the costs of health-care solutions gets into dicey political ground­—echoes of “rationing” and “death panels”—as well as larger ethical issues. Virginia Rowthorn, an expert in global health law at the University of Maryland, gives the example of detecting cervical cancer with vinegar—a technique used in many developing countries. “If that technology were taken to an underserved area in the U.S., you can imagine the debate that would raise. Not only are we bringing in tech from a low-income country, now we’re using it with vulnerable populations in our society—it could be seen as another form of systematic discrimination against these groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the U.S. would object to the idea of people getting something they perceive to be less than the standard of care, even if the alternative is no access at all. (Because medical devices are rarely tested against each other, we don’t always know if cheaper technologies are more or less effective than expensive ones.) But this moral stance may simply be a fig leaf for another moral quandary. “In the U.S., we’ve tended to say cost is no object, but at the same time we’re comfortable with millions of people being uninsured,” Nancy Kass, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Berman Institute of Bioethics said. “We make our own tradeoffs here; we just don’t describe them the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Saag, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who worked on a novel &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/em&gt;-prevention program in Zambia, some elements of which were ultimately adopted in his state, believes that the flow of ideas and technologies between higher- and lower-income countries should be “bidirectional,” for a simple reason: “A lot of the problems that we see in sub-Saharan Africa we see in rural Alabama, especially in regards to access to care for pregnant women. There are entire counties lacking in maternal-health resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burke’s uterine-balloon device has captured the attention of midwives and other health-care providers working in the U.S. and Canada. Susana Ku, a midwife and teacher at Ryerson University, told me that there are places in Canada where the more expensive uterine balloons are prohibitive for many midwives and providers, many of whom cover far-flung rural territories and work with underserved indigenous populations. Burke’s UBT is currently under review by the F.D.A.; even if it’s approved, it won’t necessarily be used in the U.S. anytime soon. Regardless of its efficacy, it’s hard to imagine a company stepping in to do the necessary marketing and sales for a low-cost product whose use is infrequent. Burke says that his work was always focussed on resource-limited countries, but perhaps that definition is more elusive than one might think. “We’re the only country on earth, other than Syria, where the maternal-mortality rate has gone up in the last decade,” he says, of the United States. “Syria’s at war!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kass, the bioethicist, is trying to puzzle out the ethics of what might be seen as lower-quality solutions. Consider, she says, a doctor on a plane. “They’re called to do something, and they don’t have everything with them, but you’re glad that they can do a little bit of what they can until the plane lands.” Burke has been that doctor. He, like many others, is doing what he can until women’s medicine improves, until standard anesthesia becomes widespread, until people across the globe have the access to the care they all deserve. He did not have his patients in Boston in mind when he began looking for low-cost, unorthodox solutions to stubbornly persistent global health problems. But, in a country like the U.S., faced with spiralling health-care costs and access-to-care issues, where innovation typically leads to more expensive and sometimes unnecessary technologies, it may be time for medicine, still often dominated by a closed, guild-like mentality, to think more inventively. Home Depot might not be a bad place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

Mongo isn’t exciting anymore, Angular 1 is dead, CoffeeScript is obsolete, I haven’t heard a word about Meteor since it launched…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It beats being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/&quot;&gt;Magpie Developer&lt;/a&gt;. I have more time time to pet my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziggyforamerica.com&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, read a lot of books, make fresh pasta by hand, and circle a more slowly evolving collection of powerful technologies that let’s me get stuff done without spending half my free time chasing shiny new things.&lt;/p&gt;

More Tagliatelle, less code.
&lt;p&gt;By and large I find enough time to explore new browser features like CSS Grid and Service Workers—things I can actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years into its hype cycle, it’s probably safe to say the React &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt;, if not the library itself, has staying power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the Wes Bos tutorial a few years ago, said, yep, this is cool, and it would be a good tool for the job if you made an app with a lot of changing visual state, like Asana or Jira. But a news site, for example, which is all about reading text on a page, doesn’t reap the benefits.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve also noticed another possible benefit: if you have a big team with a range of skill levels, it gives you a predefined pattern on how to break up and assign work without every person needing to understand the whole organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good. One of these days, I thought, I should do a toy project in it. And after a year of looking for one, I’m starting to realize something very odd: I can’t find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t make side projects for other people anymore, but I make all sorts of little things for myself. In addition to this site, I have a homemade expense tracking app&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, an automated newsletter to myself that’s composed from RSS feeds… etc. I’ve toyed with a cooking app a few times but concluded without a lot of manual work to turn recipes into structured data, it’s not actually better than Dropbox Paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at these, they’re almost all CRUD apps, even if the “Create” comes from an API, RSS feed, or webhook. Something puts data in them, and they do something with the information that you couldn’t do 10 years ago when it was tied up in Email/Documents/Spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one more thing: it’s possible to make fast, efficient CRUD apps the same way we made them in 2010. Fire up Django or Rails, stick the data in Postgres, put some thought into your forms and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; add a tiny bit of javascript to enhance some input fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely I must be missing something. Surely the billions of programming hours that have gone into all these new things aren’t in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind that. I decided to build my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in.&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; replacement. It’s easy. Pinboard is… pretty good, but I like the idea of a hybrid between a bookmarking service that could also keep images and markdown notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started playing around, using Django Rest Framework for the API, Rollup to build because Rollup is easy, Preact because its smaller and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m liking classes for bigger components like the bookmarks index and stateless functions for each item in the list. There’s a natural obviousness to writing &lt;code&gt;handleClick&lt;/code&gt; methods for everything that can be clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a pubSub pattern for state management because Redux, while people like it, felt wildly overcomplicated for what I wanted to do. The components listen on a single shared &lt;code&gt;pubSub&lt;/code&gt; event bus, but can tell any API service to update itself, which will then kick off the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced to an illustrative example, it looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;js&quot;&gt;import { pubSub, EVENTS, bookmarksService } from &quot;../services&quot;;
import { SearchForm, BookmarkComponent } from &quot;./other-components&quot;;

export class BookmarkIndex extends Component {

  handleLoadBookmarks({ bookmarks, filters, pagination }) {
    this.setState({
      marks: bookmarks,
      filters: filters,
      pagination: pagination,
    });

    const query = e.target.querySelector('[name=&quot;search&quot;]').value;
    bookmarksService.update({ search: query });
  }

  handleClear(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    bookmarksService.update({});
  }

  render(props, state) {
    const marks = state.marks || [];

    return (
      &amp;lt;div class=&quot;l-app&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;l-main&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;SearchForm searchAction={this.search.bind(this)} /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;section class=&quot;c-marks&quot;&amp;gt;
            {marks.map(BookmarkComponent)}
          &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    );
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of cool. I’ve got a clear, predictable one-way data flow without any of the cognitive overhead I saw in the popular state managers. A service represents shared state. Any component ask the service to do something, and any component can listen for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I just spent an enormous amount of time implementing what would have been something like this if it were just server-side Python&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def bookmarks(request):
    bookmarks = Bookmark.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    search = request.GET.get('search', None)
    tag = request.GET.get('tag', None)

    if search:
        bookmarks = bookmarks.special_search_method(search)

    if tag:
        bookmarks = bookmarks.search_by_tag(tags=tag)

    return render(request, &quot;bookmarks.html&quot;, {
        &quot;bookmarks&quot;: bookmarks,
    })

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Preact stuff is kind of fun. But it feels like adding a lot of complexity, and I can’t pin down how it benefits most of these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of SPAs, some people argued that it would be faster to only pass the data you need as JSON than to render whole pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade later, this is almost never true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Recent Charges” page of my budget app is 5kb of HTML.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pinboard clone loads 400 bytes of HTML, followed by 36kb of javascript, and 35kb of data from the API. The JS bundle alone is more than 7x the weight of the rendered page, can’t be called until the first HTTP request completes, and still has to make an API call.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory subsequent actions might be faster once the page is loaded. That may be true, particularly if the pages are cluttered, and only some components need to update on an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that assumes you make subsequent actions more often that initial actions. That may be true for Slack. But if I think about how I use Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Atlassian apps, or almost any other large js-heavy application, I find myself jumping in and out of them alongside other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true for a bookmarks manager: my main use case is to open in and search for something very specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few things that would benefit from being SPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chat application is a no-brainer. A dashboard of realtime data might not need to be a SPA, but would benefit from a reactive component that updates when the API is polled. Maybe a complicated tool like Trello, a Calendar or a Nonlinear Video Editor could make sense, but even those have distinct screens, so a large reactive component on a particular screen may be a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more interesting is how many apps I’m seeing built as an SPA that really don’t need to be. Why does a website that orders food from restaurants need a Megabyte of javascript?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure that out by inspecting the API calls. It turned out they were tracking every mouse event. So that’s nice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why consider this app in Preact in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because of Progressive Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to try and make it work offline. To do that, and do it well, you need a way to show the data in different ways even when you can’t call a server. This calls for javascript templating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I finished the list page—it has pagination, search, tags, etc. all working—but still need to do the create and edit. It’s taken longer than I feel like it should, and I haven’t even started the Service Worker component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a conclusion. It’s messy and complicated. As a way to learn, the Bookmarks project is fun. As a productive and maintainable thing, it’s not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may tear it down the moment I finish and switch to a traditional MVC style, or find a more minimalistic approach that can work well with offline support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, stop coding and pet your dog. He would appreciate a belly rub.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tasks That Can Be Done with Pure HTML and CSS</title>
<link>https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4399/get-these-dependencies-off-my-lawn-5-tasks-you-didnt-know-could-be-done-with-pure-html-and-css</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4399/get-these-dependencies-off-my-lawn-5-tasks-you-didnt-know-could-be-done-with-pure-html-and-css</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that are built into the HTML and CSS standards that you probably didn't know about. Or maybe you did. Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in my day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/&quot;&gt;you had to write like two lines of JavaScript to implement smooth scrolling&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, you can do &lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;html{ scroll-behavior:smooth; }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 256 Kilobytes website uses the CSS snippet above for smooth scrolling. Click a link in the table of contents to test the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to working when users scroll to anchors, if you Ctrl+F on a page with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html{ scroll-behavior:smooth; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it smooth scrolls to the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hsl-colors-are-built-into-the-css-standard&quot;&gt;HSL Colors are Built Into the CSS Standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt; spend seven years doing internet marketing&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; discover basic color formats today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.283950617284&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSL color model defines a given color according to its hue, saturation, and lightness components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#hsl()&quot;&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#hsl()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how HSL colors work, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://hslpicker.com/&quot;&gt;a tool that demonstrates how HSL colors work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;auto-embed youtube&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/A60HjujkzhI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSL (and HSLA, to adjust opacity) colors can be used anywhere that RGB, hexadecimal, and named colors can be used. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-a-fucking-built-in-html-toggle&quot;&gt;There's a fucking built-in HTML toggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fucking built-in HTML toggle, created through using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;Sample Text&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Read this sample text.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;details&gt;Sample Text
&lt;p&gt;Read this sample text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they say in my home country, &quot;JavaScript is for casuals.&quot; Or, alternatively, as they also say in my home country, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-that-details-summary-is-the-easiest-way-ever-to-make-an-accordion/&quot;&gt;you could write JavaScript and/or CSS, but that sounds hard&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;html5-has-built-in-progress-bars-and-meters&quot;&gt;HTML5 Has Built-In Progress Bars and Meters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this extremely self-explanatory section of this article about &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;progress&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meter&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;meter value=&quot;4&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Section 4 of 5&lt;/meter&gt;&lt;progress value=&quot;69&quot; max=&quot;420&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;meter value=&quot;0.69&quot;&gt;69%&lt;/meter&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meter value=&quot;4&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;5&quot;&amp;gt;Section 4 of 5&amp;lt;/meter&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;progress value=&quot;69&quot; max=&quot;420&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/progress&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meter value=&quot;0.69&quot;&amp;gt;69%&amp;lt;/meter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;css-variables-exist-as-do-attribute-selectors&quot;&gt;CSS Variables Exist (As Do Attribute Selectors) &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/&quot;&gt;others have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, adding CSS frameworks (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;) and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hNDzcpWwFM&quot;&gt;CSS preprocessors&lt;/a&gt; (such as SASS, LESS, and SCSS) to a project can, in many cases, add unneeded bloat, dependencies, complexity, and technical debt, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem obvious, it is more common than you might expect for developers to be unaware that &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt; exist natively and they're &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUB039MG0I&quot;&gt;very straightforward to pick up&lt;/a&gt;, if they're new to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors&quot;&gt;Attribute selectors&lt;/a&gt; are another example of native CSS functionality that can solve problems that developers often overcomplicate. Do you want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Style all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags (links) that have &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; values that end with .pdf or that start with &quot;https&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style all links that have the &lt;code&gt;rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&lt;/code&gt; attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style all form inputs with the attribute and value of &lt;code&gt;type=&quot;email&quot;&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all tasks that can be done purely with CSS attribute selectors with no need for jQuery, SASS, and/or other external dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;auto-embed youtube&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/GVocONem9lw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you're here reading about CSS functionality that developers are often unaware of, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Combinators_and_multiple_selectors&quot;&gt;documentation on combinators and selector lists&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably even learned something. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew all of these things and this is a bad article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Probably Someone&lt;/p&gt;
