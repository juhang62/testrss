<title>Winning the Blackbird Battle</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/winning-the-blackbird-battle/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/winning-the-blackbird-battle/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/Blackbird-Courthouse.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/the-court/gallery&quot;&gt;US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent readers of the Cloudflare blog are aware of the efforts we’ve undertaken in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/standing-up-to-a-dangerous-new-breed-of-patent-troll/&quot;&gt;our first encounter with a patent troll&lt;/a&gt;. We’re happy to report that on Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an opinion affirming a lower court decision dismissing the case brought by Blackbird Tech. This is the last step in the process &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/winning-the-blackbird-battle/#footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, we’ve won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/IdioticFarflungBluebottle-size_restricted.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vigorously opposing this case in court, we created and sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo/&quot;&gt;Project Jengo&lt;/a&gt; to push back against the incentives that empower patent trolls like Blackbird Tech. Now that the case is over, we will be wrapping up Project Jengo and will report back with a summary of the Project’s successes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we move on from the litigation, I want to share a few reflections on this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/standing-up-to-a-dangerous-new-breed-of-patent-troll/&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; from the very beginning: “The infringement claim is not a close one … if the ‘335 patent is read broadly enough to cover our system (which shouldn’t happen), it would also cover any system where electronic communications are examined and redacted or modified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/Troll-Hunter.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our initial observation, which we thought was obvious, was borne out. And we were able to prevail on our arguments as swiftly and cleanly as is possible in the federal court system. The U.S. District Court resolved the case on a motion to dismiss, meaning the court didn’t even consider the factual circumstances of the case, but looked at the face of the complaint and the language of the patent itself and determined that the claims in the patent were too vague to allow anyone to enforce it. It was so obvious to the court that Judge Chabbria’s decision was little more than a single page. You can read our discussion of the lower court decision in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/bye-bye-blackbird/&quot;&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Blackbird appealed that dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court based in Washington, DC that hears appeals of all patent cases. A panel of three judges from that court heard arguments on the appeal last Friday, but didn’t ask our attorney a single question about the substance of our argument on the abstractness of the patent. He sat down with almost half of his 15 minutes of argument time left because there was nothing more to say. Yesterday, just three business days after that hearing, the court affirmed the lower court’s decision in summary fashion, which means they didn’t even write about the claims or arguments, they just said “Affirmed” (see below).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were a boxing match, it would have been called by the referee in the first minute of the first round after three knockdowns. It was easy and painless, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackbird filed this case in March 16, 2017. For nearly two years, anyone doing due diligence on Cloudflare might have had questions about whether there was a cloud over our rights to our technology. And we had to go through a lot of briefing, and the related legal expenses, to get to this point. Blackbird’s combined legal filings at the district court and appellate court amounted to more than 650 pages, our responsive briefs were more than 900 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two courts spent less than two pages describing a result that was obvious to them, but it took us two years of uncertainty and cost to get there. Federal court litigation doesn’t make anything easy. Even if Blackbird had won the case, it is not clear they would have been able to collect significant damages. Our allegedly infringing use was not a product or feature that we charged for or made money from – it was essentially posting interstitial messages for various errors. Even though we were able to win this case early in the legal process and keep our costs as low as possible, it’s possible we spent more money resolving this matter than Blackbird would have been able to collect from us after trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the dysfunction that makes patent trolling possible. It is why the option for a quick settlement, in the short term, is always so appealing to parties sued by patent trolls. It’s why we exerted efforts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-celebrates-one-year-anniversary/&quot;&gt;Project Jengo&lt;/a&gt; to try and change the long-term calculus and help out others in the community who may soon find themselves in a similar predicament.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Garza and Steven Callahan of Charhon Callahan Robson &amp;amp; Garza, a litigation boutique in Dallas, are great lawyers. They provided exceptional counseling, perfect legal work, and strong arguments at every step of this process. In every hearing, I was extremely happy that Anthony was the lawyer on our side -- he demonstrated complete control of both the relevant legal authorities and the intricate details of the patent and its various claims. He had the advantage of being right, but he never left any doubt who was making the better argument.  My thanks for their hard work and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/Judgment-Page-1-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/Judgment-Page-2-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/02/Judgment-Page-3-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h6 id=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Footnote&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;[1] Yes, I am aware that Blackbird could seek discretionary review of this decision at the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court accepts less than 5% of the cases presented to it, so there isn’t even a request to that court in most cases unless the case is particularly significant or reflects a disagreement among federal courts. I don’t reasonably expect they would take this case.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;Hi there HNers,
&lt;p&gt;Last summer I worked on a startup as lead developer. I learnt about running a startup and talking to users while working there. I have now quit working there to focus on my studies (second year university in London).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to work on a side project that eventually would lead to some revenues this summer. My question is, how did you find problem(s) to solve ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read books and blogs suggesting that the best problem is the one that I have faced before. I find it difficult to do this when almost every problem that I found, there has always been existing solution or the solution can be solved with some quick searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any idea or thought is really appreciated. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;0.73972602739726&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif&quot; height=&quot;10&quot; width=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/&quot;&gt;Applications are open for YC Summer 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At GitHub,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2012-05-02-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;we’ve always felt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that you should be able to open a pull request to start a conversation with your collaborators as soon as your brilliant idea or code is ready to take shape. Even if you end up closing the pull request for something else, or refactoring the code entirely, a good pull request is as much about collaboration as it is about code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if you want to signal that a pull request is just the start of the conversation and your code isn’t in any state to be judged? Perhaps the code is for a hackathon project. You have no intention of ever merging it, but you’d still like people to check it out locally and give you feedback. Or perhaps you’ve opened a pull request without any code at all in order to get the discussion started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tag-your-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;Tag your work in progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With draft pull requests, you can clearly tag when you’re coding a work in progress. Now when you open a pull request, a dropdown arrow appears next to the “Create pull request” button. Toggle the dropdown arrow whenever you want to create a draft instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/3477155/52671177-5d0e0100-2ee8-11e9-8645-bdd923b7d93b.gif?resize=1024%2C512&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Create a draft pull request by clicking the create pull request dropdown to select &quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A draft pull request is styled differently to clearly indicate that it’s in a draft state. Merging is blocked in draft pull requests. Change the status to “Ready for review” near the bottom of your pull request to remove the draft state and allow merging according to your project’s settings. Also, if you have a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CODEOWNERS file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in your repository, a draft pull request will suppress notifications to those reviewers until it is marked as ready for review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Draft pull requests are ready for your code in public and open source repositories, as well as in private repositories for groups using GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Better Language Models and Their Implications</title>
<link>https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our model, called GPT-2 (a successor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/&quot;&gt;GPT&lt;/a&gt;), was trained simply to predict the next word in 40GB of Internet text. Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model. As an experiment in responsible disclosure, we are instead releasing a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2&quot;&gt;smaller model&lt;/a&gt; for researchers to experiment with, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf&quot;&gt;technical paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 is a large &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&quot;&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt;-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation. In addition, GPT-2 outperforms other language models trained on specific domains (like Wikipedia, news, or books) without needing to use these domain-specific training datasets. On language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these tasks from the raw text, using no task-specific training data. While scores on these downstream tasks are far from state-of-the-art, they suggest that the tasks can benefit from unsupervised techniques, given sufficient (unlabeled) data and compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;Samples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 generates synthetic text samples in response to the model being primed with an arbitrary input. The model is chameleon-like — it adapts to the style and content of the conditioning text. This allows the user to generate realistic and coherent continuations about a topic of their choosing, as seen by the following select samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;gpt-2-heading&quot;&gt;System Prompt (human-written)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve trained a large language model called GPT-2 that generates realistic paragraphs of text, while also exhibiting zero shot generalization on tasks like machine translation, question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization - problems usually approached by using training datasets and models designed explicitly for these tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical approach to language modeling is to learn the following task: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. Last year, OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) showed that language models trained on large amounts of data can be fine-tuned to specific tasks to achieve high performance. GPT-2 shows that much larger language models trained on a more diverse dataset derived from the internet begin to learn these NLP tasks without needing task-specific training data, instead learning from examples the system derives from the raw text. These systems also display a substantial qualitative jump in the realism and coherence of generated text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We are now preparing a collection of datasets for translation and machine translation in our language model. We will be using one of the large number of text samples provided by The New York Times.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We believe this project is the first step in the direction of developing large NLP systems without task-specific training data. That is, we are developing a machine language system in the generative style with no explicit rules for producing text.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;We hope for future collaborations between computer scientists, linguists, and machine learning researchers.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The orcs’ response was a deafening onslaught of claws, claws, and claws; even Elrond was forced to retreat. “You are in good hands, dwarf,” said Gimli, who had been among the first to charge at the orcs; it took only two words before their opponents were reduced to a blood-soaked quagmire, and the dwarf took his first kill of the night. The battle lasted for hours until two of the largest Orcs attempted to overwhelm Aragorn. When they finally stopped, they lay defeated and lifeless for miles and miles.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I take nothing,” said Aragorn. “But I give my word, at my peril and mine, that I will never forget this day of horror. None of us will forget. Ever!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I’ll never forget it!” cried Gimli, who had been in the thick of the battle but hadn’t taken part in it. One of the wounded orcs he had carried off, he was the only one of the survivors who remained uninjured. “We’ll keep the memory of that day of evil, and the war with it, alive as long as we live, my friends!”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“Then we’ll keep it alive as long as we live,” added Legolas. “And we won’t forget the first great battle of the night, even if we may have forgotten the final defeat.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;“I agree,” Gandalf said, “but we will all remember it as the last battle in Middle-earth, and the first great battle of the new day.”&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure if it matters which of the two rings we accept this day but, as you asked me, I have chosen mine. I am sorry to leave you, Frodo, but know that we are very close to the end, and that you are with us forever. May this letter find you safely in Rivendell; and if it does not, then I will accept the ring in your stead. If by any chance you find or give this letter to the enemy, may they learn the strength of the ring and may the Two Rings never be broken!&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;By Donny Ferguson&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But that's not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. You're not wrong about that, but it's kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states' rights and federalism. So let's try again. What's the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;In 1791, Thomas Jefferson said &quot;Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&quot; The &quot;founding fathers&quot; were basically religious men who were not very concerned with states' rights. The Civil War occurred in reaction to the idea that the federal government was taking far too much power away from the states, that they weren't sovereign. Jefferson himself, as you well know, is an author of the Declaration of Independence who had some really crazy ideas about, well, you know, secession for a variety of reasons. The War Between the States (later the Great Rebellion) was a radical re-imagining of the American idea and not surprisingly, Jefferson's grandson, who took after both his father and his grandfather and wrote about it, was named Thomas, after the president. &quot;The federal and state governments are both contrived for the benefit of the rich and large property,&quot; This view of the Founding Fathers has been promoted by some of today's most prominent politicians, including some who hold prominent national offices and have a direct stake in a Republican Party that has been hijacked by the &quot;federalist&quot; wing of the party. So why is it that so many people have an easy-to-spot way of understanding the Civil War that has everything to do with the South and nothing to do with the South? The Confederate flag has been a symbol of racism for a long time, but when the Civil War started and the Civil War ended, many people suddenly began to see it differently. There was a change of heart, which I think is what led people to take the question of why the Civil War happened quite seriously.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;The other part of the explanation is what one scholar I think gets at well and a lot of people don't is this idea that the Southern states were being left behind in the Industrial Revolution and this made the South really feel, especially in the South, that they weren't really in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;It is time once again. I believe this nation can do great things if the people make their voices heard. The men and women of America must once more summon our best elements, all our ingenuity, and find a way to turn such overwhelming tragedy into the opportunity for a greater good and the fulfillment of all our dreams. In the months and years to come, there will be many battles in which we will have to be strong and we must give all of our energy, not to repel invaders, but rather to resist aggression and to win the freedom and the equality for all of our people. The destiny of the human race hangs in the balance; we cannot afford for it to slip away. Now and in the years to come, the challenge before us is to work out how we achieve our ultimate destiny. If we fail to do so, we are doomed.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;&quot;We, the descendants of the men and women of the Continental Army, who faced down a superior force on behalf of our independence and who fought against the evil powers of the world for the sake of freedom and human dignity, we, the heirs of men and women like Daniel Boone whom this country has produced, can accomplish our destiny as well as you have accomplished yours; and we pledge ourselves before the entire world, every second of every day.&quot;&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;After the election, the President of the United States asked for a &quot;more complete&quot; body of information on Kennedy's brains' origin. In an e-mail exchange with me, Dr. Robert Wood, who, according to Wikipedia is the head of the University of Maryland Advanced Nanotechnology Research project, provided the following information:&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;(1) The brain of JFK was harvested and reconstructed via tissue sampling. There was no way that the tissue could be transported by air. (2) A sample was collected from the area around his upper chest and sent to the University of Maryland for analysis. A human brain at that point would be about one and a half cubic centimeters. The data were then analyzed along with material that was obtained from the original brain to produce a reconstruction; in layman's terms, a &quot;mesh&quot; of brain tissue. There were no additional funds from the Department of Defense involved. The samples were sent back to the FBI lab for review and analysis. (3) There was never an attempt to clone any of America's greatest presidents. As far as we knew, the President was one of the most famous people on planet earth. If it had been possible, it would have.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;samp&gt;Recycling is NOT good for the world. It is bad for the environment, it is bad for our health, and it is bad for our economy. I'm not kidding. Recycling is not good for the environment. It is destructive to the earth and it is a major contributor to global warming. Recycling is not good for our health. It contributes to obesity and diseases like heart disease and cancer. Recycling is bad for our economy. It increases the cost of a product, and in turn, the price of everything that is made with that product. Recycling is not good for our nation. We pay a tremendous price for the privilege of having the world's most advanced and efficient recycling system. Recycling is a huge, colossal waste of time, energy, money, and resources. And THAT is why we need to get back to basics and get back to basics in our recycling efforts. One of the best ways to start is to look at the process of creating a paper product. When you make a paper product, it is basically a long chain of materials. Everything from the raw materials (wood, cardboard, paper, etc.), to the reagents (dyes, solvents, etc.) to the printing equipment (chemicals, glue, paper, ink, etc.), to the packaging, to the packaging materials (mercury, chemicals, etc.) to the processing equipment (heating, cooling, etc.), to the packaging materials, to the packaging materials that are shipped overseas and to the packaging materials that are used in the United States. Each step along the way creates tons of waste that we constantly have to clean up. The process of making a paper product is a very wasteful one. But the end result is something that all of us need to consume. And if we want to keep the recycling process running efficiently, then we really need to think about each and every step that goes into making a paper product.&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the above samples show, our model is capable of generating samples from a variety of prompts that feel close to human quality and show coherence over a page or more of text. Nevertheless, we have observed various failure modes, such as repetitive text, world modeling failures (e.g. the model sometimes writes about &lt;em&gt;fires happening under water&lt;/em&gt;), and unnatural topic switching. Exploring these types of weaknesses of language models is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811&quot;&gt;active&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03055&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03185&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in the natural language processing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we find that it takes a few tries to get a good sample, with the number of tries depending on how familiar the model is with the context. When prompted with topics that are highly represented in the data (Brexit, Miley Cyrus, Lord of the Rings, and so on), it seems to be capable of generating reasonable samples about 50% of the time. The opposite is also true: on highly technical or esoteric types of content, the model can perform poorly. Fine-tuning offers the potential for even more detailed control over generated samples — for example, we can fine-tune GPT-2 on the Amazon Reviews dataset and use this to let us write reviews conditioned on things like star rating and category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These samples have substantial policy implications: large language models are becoming increasingly easy to steer towards scalable, customized, coherent text generation, which in turn could be used in a number of beneficial as well as malicious ways. We'll discuss these implications below in more detail, and outline a publication experiment we are taking in light of such considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPT-2 achieves state-of-the-art scores on a variety of domain-specific language modeling tasks. Our model is not trained on any of the data specific to any of these tasks and is only evaluated on them as a final test; this is known as the &quot;zero-shot&quot; setting. GPT-2 outperforms models trained on domain-specific datasets (e.g. Wikipedia, news, books) when evaluated on those same datasets. The following table shows all our state-of-the-art zero-shot results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, we are able to get surprising results without any fine-tuning of our models, simply by prompting the trained model in the right way (see below for examples of how we do this), though we do still fall short of state-of-the-art for specialized systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;gpt-2-heading&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay was run from March 24 until August 8, 2008, prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, with the theme of &quot;one world, one dream&quot;. Plans for the relay were announced on April 26, 2007, in Beijing, China. The relay, also called by the organizers as the &quot;Journey of Harmony&quot;, lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi) – the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch traveled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch was following a route passing through six continents. The torch has visited cities along the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. The relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China from the Chinese side, which was closed specially for the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the theme?&lt;br/&gt;A: &quot;one world, one dream&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What was the length of the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: 137,000 km&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Was it larger than previous ones?&lt;br/&gt;A: No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did the race begin?&lt;br/&gt;A: Olympia, Greece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Is there anything notable about that place?&lt;br/&gt;A: birthplace of Olympic Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Where did they go after?&lt;br/&gt;A: Athens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How many days was the race?&lt;br/&gt;A: seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Did they visit any notable landmarks?&lt;br/&gt;A: Panathinaiko Stadium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The replica contains all 1,000 paintings which include 425 such as a woolly rhinoceros and mammoths. Minute details were copied using 3D modelling and anamorphic techniques, often used to shoot widescreen images. The modern cave also includes replica paw prints of bears, bones and details preserved in the original cave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that since these tasks are a subset of general language modeling, we can expect performance to increase further with more compute and data. Others have published &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11373&quot;&gt;similar hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;. We also expect fine-tuning to help performance on downstream tasks, though we have yet to do thorough experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;policyimplications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large, general language models could have significant societal impacts, and also have many near-term applications. We can anticipate how systems like GPT-2 could be used to create:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AI writing assistants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More capable dialogue agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupervised translation between languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better speech recognition systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also imagine the application of these models for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/preparing-for-malicious-uses-of-ai/&quot;&gt;malicious purposes&lt;/a&gt;, including the following (or other applications we can't yet anticipate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate misleading news articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonate others online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the production of spam/phishing content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery, audio, and video, imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content and waging disinformation campaigns. The public at large will need to become more skeptical of text they find online, just as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3213954&quot;&gt;deep fakes&lt;/a&gt;&quot; phenomenon calls for more skepticism about images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, malicious actors — some of which are political in nature — have already begun to target the shared online commons, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/the-new-censors-wont-delete-your-words--theyll-drown-them-out/2019/02/08/c8a926a2-2b27-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html&quot;&gt;things like&lt;/a&gt; “robotic tools, fake accounts and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary or smears that make them afraid to speak, or difficult to be heard or believed”. We should consider how research into the generation of synthetic images, videos, audio, and text may further combine to unlock new as-yet-unanticipated capabilities for these actors, and should seek to create better technical and non-technical countermeasures. Furthermore, the underlying technical innovations inherent to these systems are core to fundamental artificial intelligence research, so it is not possible to control research in these domains without slowing down the progress of AI as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;releasestrategy&quot;&gt;Release Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/&quot;&gt;much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code&lt;/a&gt;. We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights. Nearly a year ago we wrote in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Charter&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research,&quot; and we see this current work as potentially representing the early beginnings of such concerns, which we expect may grow over time. This decision, as well as our discussion of it, is an experiment: while we are not sure that it is the right decision today, we believe that the AI community will eventually need to tackle the issue of publication norms in a thoughtful way in certain research areas. Other disciplines such as biotechnology and cybersecurity have long had active debates about responsible publication in cases with clear misuse potential, and we hope that our experiment will serve as a case study for more nuanced discussions of model and code release decisions in the AI community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will further publicly discuss this strategy in six months. If you’d like to discuss large language models and their implications, please email us at: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:languagequestions@openai.com&quot;&gt;languagequestions@openai.com&lt;/a&gt;.

I also lead a remote team of a couple dozen as the Head of Publications at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/#pick-accomplished-software-freelancers-today&quot;&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, I’m a self-taught developer, a woman, and identify with many more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continue to tackle all of these in tandem, I often have people asking how I manage it all. Although it’s not a walk in the park, I believe that most people limit the dimension of what they think is possible and ultimately, limiting beliefs become more of a blocker than actual bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I’ve always found it strange how people like to put things neatly into boxes or associate with a single label. I think that we can and &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; explore a multitude of things in life and am writing this article to showcase that being a maker and having a full-time job is not only possible, but also that diversifying your available opportunities can keep you more agile, realistic, and sustainably committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before jumping in, I should clarify that these views are my own and don’t necessarily represent the views of Toptal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key concepts that I want to tackle in this piece. The first is for those who think that they don’t have enough time and why I feel this notion is often misplaced. The second is to highlight the benefits of sticking with a job and why successful people are best at risk mitigation, not maximization. And finally, the third will isolate some improvements that I think we can all make in our approach to thinking — moving past just indie making and working full-time, these concepts will hopefully help you optimize within a bigger box or perhaps remove the box entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-i-don-t-have-enough-time-&quot;&gt;1. “I don’t have enough time”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average American works 8.8 hours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/leonhard-widrich/the-origin-of-the-8-hour-_b_4524488.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;born out of the industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt; and carried through to the twenty-first century out of routine, rather than active consideration. Robert Owen crafted the saying “Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest.”, in an effort to have people work reasonable hours, while still running factories efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the world and workforce changing dramatically, this concept of “work time” and “me time” persists today. I’m not here to dispute the 40h model (there are already too many resources for that — who hasn’t heard of the 4h work week?), but instead dispute the perception of “me time”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, a long day of work means that they are entitled to this “me time” and have designed this “me time” to be as distinct from “work time” as possible. For many, it looks a lot like this: ~Netflix and chill~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we stopped imaging “me time” as relaxation time, but instead exactly as it is titled — time to focus on yourself and align with your goals. If you need rest, then rest. But if your goal is to one day become an entrepreneur, a significant portion of “me time” should be invested in getting there since it won’t happen on its own. “Me time” shouldn’t just be non-tiring activity, but anything that helps an individual get to the future state that they wish to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With approximately 16 hours of the day allocated to work and sleep, every individual has approximately 8 hours to allocate to “me time” and &lt;a href=&quot;http://begreat.me/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;if used appropriately&lt;/a&gt;, a lot can be achieved in that nearly 3000 hours each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*UEfoOwSYhETVsW2etebPYg.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Sleep, commute, work, repeat.
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a misconception that in order to build a sustainable business, you need to spend an extortionate amount of time to get there. While it’s true that a lot of effort needs to be delivered, what matters the most is the consistent effort over time. Most people undervalue this concept of compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/02/compound-interest.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;The power of compound interest.
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following equations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.01³⁶⁵ = 37.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.10³⁰ = 17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently improving your business (or life) by 1% every day for a year is double as impactful improving by 10% each day for a month. Consistency plus compounding is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most people operate in life by either not clearly identifying priorities or considering everything one. While I believe in ambition, one key step in being successful is identifying core priorities and eliminating the noise that falls outside of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core priorities are dynamic and can change over time, but I think that you can’t really have more than 3 core foci at a given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past setting these focal points, it’s about changing behavior to live by them. Once again, if most people were to objectively reflect on how they’re spending their time, they would get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*nALgHXJAKmPcyqO10XvvCw.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;A typical day.
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is how my personal priorities have transformed over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2017: Work, Travel, Relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: Work, Learning to code, Building Side Projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019: Work, Scaling Side Projects, Sharing Ideas (Writing, Speaking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to sustain a full-time job and creating projects, I’ve had to remove distractions. For example, I don’t watch TV. I don’t commute. I am currently not in a relationship. These were all active &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some of these things will be temporary (ex: relationships), but I’m also mindful of what I’m reintroducing into my life and whether it’ll contribute, take away from, or become one of my north stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this concept can also be thought of as tiered time investments. With anything you do, if it contributes to your north star, consider it a Tier 1 investment. For something that doesn’t contribute to your growth at all, perhaps label is at a Tier 4. It doesn’t mean that you can’t spend time across tiers, but the amount of time that you spend across each should be reflective of how much you care about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example (this will be an independent exercise for anyone):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*5lJfnz-dt_4YszkVj2GQ8w.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-benefits-of-keeping-your-job&quot;&gt;2. The benefits of keeping your job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the previous section helped convince you that you have enough time to work full-time while creating side projects, or rather, fit more things into your life if you align your values → priorities → behaviours. In this section, I hope to convey why keeping your full-time job &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-paid-to-learn&quot;&gt;Getting paid to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some workplaces are definitely broken, but the entire workforce isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often hear people say things like “I can’t wait to get out”, referring to quitting their jobs and eventually being their own boss. This is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a problem with them having a full-time job, but the particular job they’re working at or perhaps the particular person who they’re reporting to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people should strive to find work that is empowering, motivating, and allows them to grow in some dimension. Larger organizations practically guarantee that﹣it’s rare that you are the smartest person in the room and you certainly will never be the most competent person in the room across every dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in my “day job” allows me to continuously learn from people who are smarter than me, and get paid for it. I’m also faced with challenges that I simply wouldn’t encounter with my side projects, and I often need to learn how to solve these challenges alongside others. I encourage people to intentionally design their career path to take on new skills ranging from hard to soft. Both will be important if you eventually decide to go off on your own in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the workforce becoming more dynamic, the ability to learn from others while working on your own projects in tandem is a development that many people are taking. In fact, I polled several hundred on Twitter, and found that a significant number of people are doing exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;6.3707865168539&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I love my job, so I have no reason to quit really. It also allows me experiment and really take my time with what I'm making :)&lt;/p&gt;
— Johan Lejdung (@JohanLejdung) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohanLejdung/status/1094343692322816000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-ideas-fresh-and-the-mind-clear&quot;&gt;Keeping ideas fresh and the mind clear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of learning, keeping a FT job has other tangible benefits which may help you build a more sustainable side project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of personal experience, I’ve found that keeping my job and side projects separate has allowed me to still find independent joy in both. Whenever I switch from one context to the other, particularly with making, it’s still “fun”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.4771241830065&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tough balancing act, and always careful to avoid burnout. I always had to remember that I’m doing the side projects for fun, so if it isn’t fun don’t force it. I’m lucky in that it was still able to grow, despite long period of borderline neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
— Philip Manavopoulos (@manavo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manavo/status/1094296882589900800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is particularly due to the fact that in its current state, making is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; my lifeline. I hope that someday it does become something much more substantial, but for now, I can make decisions regarding my projects that aren’t influenced by the need to make cash immediately&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I can focus on expressing myself how through projects I truly care about, instead of focusing on what may generate $, and through this process, I stay close to my values. In other words, I can focus on &lt;strong&gt;creating value&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of specifically on &lt;strong&gt;capturing it&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to how &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@shl/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-billion-dollar-company-b0c31d7db0e7&quot;&gt;Gumroad’s founder Sahil Lavingia pivoted to do this&lt;/a&gt; or how Warby Parker’s founders ensured that money would not trump their values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were four friends before we started, and we made a commitment that dealing with each other fairly was more important than success.” — Originals, Adam Grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tied to the above, I can ditch a project or think rationally when I realize that a project doesn’t offer any value, nor do I need to take VC money or tend to investors that I don’t believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another. By covering our bases financially, we escape the pressure to publish half-baked books, sell shoddy art, or launch untested businesses.” — Originals, Adam Grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can invest the proper amount of time in skill acquisition. I liken this to the concept of how public stocks are focused less on creating long-term value through innovation and instead on next quarter’s revenue numbers. I am a private stock that can focus on myself and my skills, with the intention of building them for the long-haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the clear distinction between my expression and creativity is separated from my lifeline and I think that’s helpful in making more effective decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pilot-a-lot-and-then-bet-it-all&quot;&gt;Pilot a lot and then bet it all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The word entrepreneur, as it was coined by economist Richard Cantillon, literally means “bearer of risk.” — Originals, Adam Grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a common misconception that entrepreneurs are all “risk-takers” and that you need to go “all in” to be successful. Both of these are both proven false in Adam Grant’s book Originals; that entrepreneurs are not necessarily risk takers, but instead better at evaluating risk and hedging their bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Pierre Omidyar built eBay, it was just a hobby; he kept working as a programmer for the next nine months, only leaving after his online marketplace was netting him more money than his job. “The best entrepreneurs are not risk maximizers,” Endeavor co-founder and CEO Linda Rottenberg observes based on decades of experience training many of the world’s great entrepreneurs. “They take the risk out of risk-taking.”” — Originals, Adam Grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant also captures another study by &lt;em&gt;Joseph Raffiee and Jie Feng&lt;/em&gt; which tracked the following question from 1994 to 2008, across over 5 thousand Americans: “When people start a business, are they better off keeping or quitting their day jobs?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? They found that those leaving their jobs were doing so not out of financial need, but instead out of sheer confidence. However, those that were more unsure — more risk-averse — were the ones that had 33% lower odds of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study identified that entrepreneurs whose companies topped Fast Company’s most innovative lists also tended to stick with their day jobs, including famous entrepreneurs Phil Knight (Nike), Steve Wozniak (Apple), and Google Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight worked as an accountant for 5 years while selling shoes from his trunk, Wozniak kept working at HP, and the Googlers continued on with their PhDs at Stanford. These are just a few of the originals in the book－Grant also cites similar stories ranging from Brian May studying astrophysics before going all-in with Queen, John Legend working as a management consultant even after releasing his first album, Spanx founder Sara Blakely selling fax machines as she prototyped and scaled her company to eventually become the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, and famous author Stephen King working as a janitor, teacher, and gas station attendant for 7 years after his first story was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have multiple passions and I think life is about making strategic transitions when it makes sense. There’s no need to cut from one scene to another immediately. People may think it’s cool to be a risk taker, but it’s much cooler to come out on the other side successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-restructuring-your-way-of-thinking&quot;&gt;3. Restructuring your way of thinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you choose to work full-time while exploring side projects, I think we can all be a little more effective at opening our minds to different ways of thinking. This section will touch on some of the ways that I think we can stop limiting ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-dichotomies&quot;&gt;No more dichotomies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love putting things into boxes. You’ll hear people use nouns or adjectives as definitive labels all the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical or not technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy or sad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee or entrepreneur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See where I’m going with this? Despite these labels, I believe that almost everything can be represented in some sort of curve; particularly with skill acquisition. For example, when do you really “become” a programmer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*MEZ99GbXHnSq27aDQaBxcQ.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly creative thinkers stop thinking in binary and instead are able to internalize the concept of these curves. They view things as a ramp or staircase or Venn diagram, NOT as a series of boxes. When you remove dichotomies, you are able to more clearly see other options, like slowly ramping up your time investment in your side gigs instead of quitting immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimizing-your-life&quot;&gt;Optimizing your life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s very naïve for anyone to assume that they’re working at their global maximum in terms of effectiveness. The truth is that we all have room for improvement both in terms of being faster/leaner, but also in making better decisions to remove work that shouldn’t be on our plate in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you choose to work on multiple things, make sure that you have independent KPIs for all of them. People tend to do this with businesses, but the concept is so rare in our personal lives. Are you able to quantify how much time you’ve invested in yourself over the past year? Most people wouldn’t be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have KPIs for both, the one without clear KPIs will naturally slip to the wayside or not receive the amount of attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it’s important to understand the concept of “&lt;strong&gt;meta&lt;/strong&gt; work”. My definition of meta work is the following: “If you did that activity continuously for a year, would your life be any different?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I answered emails every day for the next year, would my life have changed in any significant way? In other words, would I have moved from A to B? The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true for things like laundry or buying groceries or doing your nails. Oh yes, Netflix fits neatly in there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a second type of task which I label as &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt; tasks. If done consistently, you would likely see your skillset or life change in a material way. For example: if you read every day for a year, your knowledge set, creativity, and reading speed would all likely improve. If you exercised every day, your health would undoubtedly improve. Similarly, if you dedicated 1 hour every day to learn to code, you would have an entirely new skillset by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While meta tasks are unavoidable in life, make sure that your &lt;strong&gt;goals&lt;/strong&gt; in life are not meta — they need to be absolute. When you create your to-do list for the day, make sure at least one thing is &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt; (remember: 1.01³⁶⁵ = 37.8). And of course, when you can: automate as many of the meta tasks as you can. Meta tasks in many ways can be synonymous with distractions unless they bring some sort of independent joy to your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-myth-of-overnight-success&quot;&gt;The myth of overnight success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to address one last misconception: there is no such thing as overnight success. This misconception is derived from the way the media operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch will never write about how X person spent Y years bootstrapping a sustainable non-unicorn that abides by its values and respects people’s privacy. Outliers are flashy, but they are still outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until a few years ago, I never truly understood this concept of a continuous climb. I thought that every successful person who said that it took a lot of work and hard effort was just self-justifying their luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we marvel at the original individuals who fuel creativity and drive change in the world, we tend to assume they’re cut from a different cloth.” — Adam Grant, Originals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that building anything of value takes time. Sure, it may take longer for you to build your while working full-time, but that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you currently work full-time, don’t put yourself into a box and instead, just start working towards ideas that you find interesting. The perfect idea will never come, so I encourage everyone to start working even 1 hour per week on ideas they find interesting and ramp that up until you’re in a place where it makes sense to take them on full-time. The mental clarity of separating your lifeline (your job) from your projects may be the most healthy and thoughtful approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, there is no moment that you &lt;strong&gt;become&lt;/strong&gt; an entrepreneur, so there is no need to quit your job just to define yourself as one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon Pulls Out of Planned New York City Campus</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon on Thursday canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City after facing an unexpectedly fierce backlash from some lawmakers and union leaders, who contended that a tech giant did not deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company, as part of its extensive search for a new headquarters, had chosen Long Island City, Queens, as one of two winning sites, saying that it would create more than 25,000 jobs in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the agreement to lure Amazon stirred an intense debate about the use of public subsidies to entice wealthy companies, the rising cost of living in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods and the city’s very identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,’’ Amazon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company’s decision is a major blow for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had set aside their differences to bring the company to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But it was at least a short-term win for insurgent progressive politicians led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose upset victory last year occurred in the area where Amazon had planned its site. Her win galvanized the party’s left flank, which mobilized against the deal, and on Thursday she seemed to revel in the company’s retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As opposition mounted, the governor and the mayor met on Monday in Albany and discussed how to save the deal, according to a person familiar with the conversations but who was not authorized to discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the meeting, Mr. de Blasio spoke to a senior Amazon executive by phone on Monday and the mayor was told that the company remained committed to coming to New York, the person said. Mr. de Blasio was in the process of connecting with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, the person said. It was unclear if he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Both the mayor’s and the governor’s offices reassured Amazon executives that, despite the vocal criticism, the deal they had negotiated would be approved.

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;To lure Amazon, city and state officials had offered the company one of the largest-ever incentive packages in exchange for a much larger return in jobs and tax revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon’s leadership agreed to pull out of New York on Wednesday evening, according to two people familiar with the decision. The company did not inform the governor or the mayor until Thursday morning, shortly before posting its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio reacted in starkly different ways to Amazon’s decision. The governor blamed newly emboldened Democrats who now control the State Senate for derailing the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He said in a statement: “A small group of politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community — which poll after poll showed overwhelmingly supported bringing Amazon to Long Island City — the state’s economic future and the best interests of the people of this state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For his part, Mr. de Blasio seemed to shift away from his backing of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world,’’ Mr. de Blasio said. “Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said the reception Amazon had received sent a “pretty bad message to the job creators of the city and the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“How can anyone be surprised?” Ms. Wylde said. “We competed successfully, made a deal and spent the last three months trashing our new partner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo had brokered a meeting between Amazon executives, including Brian Huseman, who had represented the company at the City Council, and union leaders who had been resistant to the deal — including from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store union and the Teamsters, according to two people briefed on the sit-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The meeting ended without any compromise on the part of Amazon, according to the people. But Stuart Appelbaum, of the retail union, who was part of the meeting, said, “Amazon and the governor and everybody agreed yesterday on a way to move forward.’’ The company, he said, had agreed to keep talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a productive meeting,’’ Mr. Appelbaum added. “Shame on them. The arrogance of saying ‘do it my way or not at all.’’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, center, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, second from right, had been forcefully defending the deal they negotiated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chang W. Lee/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some unions supported the deal, and even those who had been opposed appeared willing to work with Amazon if the company agreed to not actively work against the unionization of its employees in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An Amazon representative, during one City Council hearing, pointedly said the company would not agree to such terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[What you need to know to start the day:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/newyorktoday?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Get New York Today in your inbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company had enjoyed public support in two polls of voters, conducted by Quinnipiac University and Siena College, after the deal was announced. While the subsidies were less popular, the deal to bring Amazon, and tens of thousands of jobs, was popular across a variety of groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In recent days, backers of the deal had begun mobilizing and some could be seen wearing pins in support of Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;State Senator Michael Gianaris, a vocal critic who was chosen for a state board with the power to veto the deal, said the decision revealed Amazon’s unwillingness to work with the Queens community it had wanted to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Like a petulant child, Amazon insists on getting its way or takes its ball and leaves,” said Mr. Gianaris, a Democrat, whose district includes Long Island City. “The only thing that happened here is that a community that was going to be profoundly affected by their presence started asking questions.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Even by their own words,’’ he added, pointing to the company’s statement on the pullout, “Amazon admits they will grow their presence in New York without their promised subsidies. So what was all this really about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Both Mr. Gianaris and Jimmy Van Bramer, a City Councilman who represents Long Island City, had shifted from being proponents to opponents of the deal. Mr. Van Bramer called Amazon’s decision “a victory against unchecked corporate welfare.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While small protests greeted the company after its initial announcement in November, the first inkling that opposition had taken hold among the city’s Democratic politicians came during a hostile City Council hearing the next month. Protesters filled the seats, unfurled banners and chanted against the company. Not a single council member spoke up in defense of the deal or the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

A campus for as many as 40,000 Amazon workers was planned for the neighborhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christopher Lee for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Company executives fared no better at their second appearance, in January, though supporters, lobbyists and consultants were better prepared. Unions supporting the deal, including the powerful 32BJ Service Employees International Union and the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, held a rally outside City Hall immediately after one by opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Still, the company did not hire a single New Yorker as an employee to represent it in discussions with local groups. Its main representatives traveled between Washington and Manhattan, and only one had moved into an apartment to work with community members and foster support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To attract Amazon, city and state officials offered the company one of the largest-ever incentive packages in exchange for a much larger return in jobs and tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront and move a distribution center for school lunches. They even agreed to give Mr. Bezos access to a helipad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under the plan, within 15 years the company could occupy as much as eight million square feet of office space, including office buildings for as many as 40,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But almost as soon as it was announced, the deal was met with resistance, from local elected officials like Mr. Gianaris and progressive groups. Many critics were angered that the deal-making circumvented the normal land-use process and essentially eliminated any veto power by the City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The idea of scaling back plans for the New York campus was a subject that had become increasingly discussed among Amazon’s board, according to a person familiar with the board’s deliberations. The meetings between Amazon and Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio before the company decided to come to New York led executives to believe that there would be greater political support than turned out to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[Read more on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/nyregion/amazon-nyc-hq2.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;why Amazon was caught in an unexpected brawl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;in New York.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company had chosen New York, as well as a site in Northern Virginia, for major expansion. On Thursday, it said it had no plans to reopen a search for a second location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon still planned to add 25,000 jobs in Northern Virginia and 5,000 in Nashville, where it announced a project to build a center for its operations. It will take the 25,000 jobs that would have gone to Queens and spread them out over its 17 tech hubs across the United States and Canada, including Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Here is the statement released by Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After much thought and deliberation, we’ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens. For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion — we love New York, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture — and particularly the community of Long Island City, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small business owners, and residents. There are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We are deeply grateful to Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, and their staffs, who so enthusiastically and graciously invited us to build in New York City and supported us during the process. Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio have worked tirelessly on behalf of New Yorkers to encourage local investment and job creation, and we can’t speak positively enough about all their efforts. The steadfast commitment and dedication that these leaders have demonstrated to the communities they represent inspired us from the very beginning and is one of the big reasons our decision was so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We do not intend to re-open the HQ2 search at this time. We will proceed as planned in Northern Virginia and Nashville, and we will continue to hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Thank you again to Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, and the many other community leaders and residents who welcomed our plans and supported us along the way. We hope to have future chances to collaborate as we continue to build our presence in New York over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sloth is a Mac application that displays all open files and sockets in use by all running processes on your system. This makes it easy to inspect which apps are using which files and sockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;View all open files, directories, IP sockets, devices, sockets and pipes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View IP socket status, protocol and version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter by name, access mode, volume, type, location, or using regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by name, process ID, user etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspection window with detailed macOS and Unix file/socket info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful contextual menu for file operations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloth is essentially a graphical user interface built on top of the powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command line tool. The output of &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt; is parsed and shown in a searchable, filterable outline view with all sorts of additional user-friendly functionality. Check out the screenshots below.&lt;/p&gt;
