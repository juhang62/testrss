&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, we are a team at Microsoft called Bling (Beyond Language Understanding), we help Bing be smarter. Here we wanted to share with all of you our &lt;strong&gt;FI&lt;/strong&gt;nite State machine and &lt;strong&gt;RE&lt;/strong&gt;gular expression manipulation library (&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;). We use Fire for many linguistic operations inside Bing such as Tokenization, Multi-word expression matching, Unknown word-guessing, Stemming / Lemmatization just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bling Fire Tokenizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bling Fire Tokenizer is a tokenizer designed for fast-speed and quality tokenization of Natural Language text. It mostly follows the tokenization logic of NLTK, except hyphenated words are split and a few errors are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLTK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
The South &lt;strong&gt;Florida/Miami&lt;/strong&gt; area has previously hosted the event 10 times .
Names such as French , ( De ) Roche , Devereux , &lt;strong&gt;D'Arcy&lt;/strong&gt; , Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The South &lt;strong&gt;Florida / Miami&lt;/strong&gt; area has previously hosted the event 10 times .

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently released model supports most of the languages except East Asian (Chinese Simplified, Traditional, Japanese, Korean, Thai). You should expect good results if a language uses space as a main token delimitter. The tokenizer high level API designed in a way that it requires 0 configuration, or initialization, or additional files and is friendly for use from languages like Python, Perl, C#, Java, etc. It is fast as uses deterministic finite state machines underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing Bling Fire with other popular NLP libraries, Bling Fire shows &lt;strong&gt;10X faster&lt;/strong&gt; speed in tokenization task&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SpaCy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.653&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;NLTK&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/wiki/Benchmark-Guide&quot;&gt;benchmark wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start using Bling Fire Library and Finite State Machine manipulation tools, you can build the project on Windows/Linux with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmake.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CMake&lt;/a&gt;. You need this if you want to create your own tokenization / segmentation, stemming etc. logic or need finite state machines for any other need. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/wiki/How-to-change-linguistic-resources&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you simply want to use it in Python, you can install the latest release using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pip/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install blingfire&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; blingfire &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
text &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;This is the Bling-Fire tokenizer&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
output &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; text_to_words(text)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/master/doc/Bling%20Fire%20Tokenizer%20Demo.ipynb&quot;&gt;This notebook&lt;/a&gt; demostrates how Bling Fire tokenizer helps in Stack Overflow posts classification problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cla.microsoft.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://cla.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. For more information see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct FAQ&lt;/a&gt; or contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:opencode@microsoft.com&quot;&gt;opencode@microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; with any additional questions or comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working Branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute directly to code base, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches there when you need them. This keeps the main repository clean and your personal workflow out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pull Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement (CLA)&lt;/a&gt;. It is an automated process and you only need to do it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the PR is labelled with &lt;code&gt;cla-not-required&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, it's classified as &lt;code&gt;cla-required&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as &lt;code&gt;cla-signed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions&quot;&gt;link the issue in the pull request&lt;/a&gt; if possible. Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Besides, keep code changes as small as possible and avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reporting Security Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:secure@microsoft.com&quot;&gt;secure@microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn606155&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MSRC PGP&lt;/a&gt; key, can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/default&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Security TechCenter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I found two identical packs of Skittles among 468 packs</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/01/09/identical-packs-of-skittles/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year discussing the likelihood of encountering two identical packs of Skittles, that is, two packs having exactly the same number of candies of each flavor. Under some reasonable assumptions, it was estimated that we should expect to have to inspect “only about 400-500 packs” on average until encountering a first duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on 12 January of this year, I started buying boxes of packs of Skittles. This past week, “only” 82 days, 13 boxes, 468 packs, and 27,740 individual Skittles later, I found the following identical 2.17-ounce packs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/04/06/follow-up-i-found-two-identical-packs-of-skittles-among-468-packs-with-a-total-of-27740-skittles/skittles_identical/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3192&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;3192&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/04/06/follow-up-i-found-two-identical-packs-of-skittles-among-468-packs-with-a-total-of-27740-skittles/skittles_identical/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;819,347&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;skittles_identical&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271?w=640&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3192&quot; src=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; srcset=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271 640w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=64 150w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=127 300w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=325 768w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png 819w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased all of the 2.17-ounce packs of Skittles for this experiment from Amazon in boxes of 36 packs each. From 12 January through 4 April, I worked my way through 13 boxes, for a total of 468 packs, at the approximate rate of six packs per day. This was enough to feel like I was making progress each day, but not enough to become annoying or risk clerical errors. For each six-pack recording session, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a pack from the box, open it, and empty and sort the contents onto a blank sheet of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a photo of the contents of the pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record, with pen and paper, the number of Skittles of each color in the pack (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty the Skittles into a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1-4; after six packs, save and review the photos, recording the color counts to file, verifying against the paper record from step 3, and checking for duplication of a previously recorded pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photos captured all of the contents of each pack, including any small flakes and chips of flavored coating that were easy to disregard… but also larger “chunks” of misshapen paste that were often only partially coated or not at all, that required some criteria up front to determine whether or how to count. For this experiment, my threshold for counting a chunk was answering “Yes” to all three of (a) is it greater than half the size of a “normal” Skittle, (b) is it completely coated with a single clearly identifiable flavor color, and (c) is it not gross, that is, would I be willing to eat it? Any “No” answer resulted in recording that pack as containing “uncounted” material, such as the pack shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3199&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;All 468 packs of Skittles, arranged top to bottom, in columns left to right. Each pair of columns corresponds to a box of 36 packs. The two identical packs are circled in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But… why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the point? Why bother with nearly three months of effort to collect this data? One easy answer is that I simply found it interesting. But I think a better answer is that this seemed like a great opportunity to demonstrate the &lt;em&gt;predictive power&lt;/em&gt; of mathematics. A few months ago, we did some calculations on a cocktail napkin, so to speak, &lt;em&gt;predicting&lt;/em&gt; that we should be able to find a pair of identical packs of Skittles with a reasonably– and perhaps surprisingly– small amount of effort. Actually seeing that effort through to the finish line can be a vivid demonstration for students of this predictive power of what might otherwise be viewed as “merely abstract” and not concretely useful mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, I think the fact that this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; concrete application happens to be recreational, or even downright frivolous, is beside the point. For one thing, recreational mathematics is fun. But perhaps more importantly, there are useful, non-recreational, “real-world” applications &lt;em&gt;of the same underlying mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. Cryptography is one such example application; this experiment is really just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack&quot;&gt;birthday attack&lt;/a&gt; in slightly more complicated form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions and predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, let’s review the approach discussed in the previous post for estimating the number of packs we need to inspect to find a duplicate. We assume that the color of each individual Skittle is independently and uniformly distributed among the &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D5&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;d=5&quot; title=&quot;d=5&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; possible flavors (strawberry, orange, lemon, green apple, and grape). We further assume that the total number &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;n&quot; title=&quot;n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; of Skittles in a pack is independently distributed with density &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, where we guessed at &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; based on similar past studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use generating functions to compute the probability &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;q&quot; title=&quot;q&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; that two &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; randomly selected packs of Skittles would be identical, where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+%5Csum_n+f%28n%29%5E2+p%28n%2C5%29+&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=2&quot; alt=&quot;q = \sum_n f(n)^2 p(n,5) &quot; title=&quot;q = \sum_n f(n)^2 p(n,5) &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%2Cd%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bd%5E%7B2n%7D%7D%5B%5Cfrac%7Bx%5E%7B2n%7D%7D%7B%28n%21%29%5E2%7D%5D%28%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5En+%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%5Ek%7D%7Bk%21%7D%29%5E2%29%5Ed+&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=2&quot; alt=&quot;p(n,d) = \frac{1}{d^{2n}}[\frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}](\sum_{k=0}^n (\frac{x^k}{k!})^2)^d &quot; title=&quot;p(n,d) = \frac{1}{d^{2n}}[\frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}](\sum_{k=0}^n (\frac{x^k}{k!})^2)^d &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, a reasonable approximation of the expected number of packs we need to inspect until encountering a first duplicate is &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cpi+%2F+%282q%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\sqrt{\pi / (2q)}&quot; title=&quot;\sqrt{\pi / (2q)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, or about 400-500 packs depending on our assumption for the pack size density &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common and controversial question asked about Skittles seems to be whether all five flavors are indeed uniformly distributed, or whether some flavors are more common than others. The following figure shows the distribution observed in this sample of 468 packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3210&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Average number of Skittles of each flavor in a pack. The assumed uniform average of 11.8547 Skittles of each color is shown by the black line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat unfortunately, this data set potentially adds fuel to the frequent accusation that the yellow Skittles dominate. However, I leave it to an interested reader to consider and analyze whether this departure from uniformity is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurate was our prior assumed distribution &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; for the total number of Skittles in each pack? The following figure shows the observed distribution from this sample of 468 packs, with the mean of 59.2735 Skittles per pack shown in red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our prior assumed average of 60 Skittles per pack was reasonable, there is strong evidence against our assumption of independence from one pack to the next, as shown in the following figure. The &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicates the pack number from 1 to 468, and the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicates the number of Skittles in the pack, either total (in black) or of each individual color. The vertical grid lines show the grouping of 36 packs per box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3207&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Number of Skittles per pack (total and of each color) vs. pack number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colored curves at bottom really just indicate the frequency and extent of outliers for the individual flavors; for example, we can see that every color appeared on at least 2 and at most 24 Skittles in every pack. The most interesting aspect of this figure, though, is the &lt;em&gt;consecutive&lt;/em&gt; spikes in &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; number of Skittles shown by the black curve, with the minimum of 45 Skittles in pack #291 immediately followed by the maximum of 73 Skittles in pack #292. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5hdtd9/got_ticked_off_about_skittles_posts_so_i_decided/&quot;&gt;this past analysis&lt;/a&gt; of a single box of 36 packs that shows similar behavior.) This suggests that the dispenser that fills each pack targets an amortized rate of weight or perhaps volume, got jammed somehow resulting in an underfilled pack, and in getting “unjammed” &lt;em&gt;overfilled&lt;/em&gt; the subsequent pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is admittedly just speculation; note, for example, that the 36 packs in each box are relatively free to shift around, and I made only a modest effort to pull packs from each box in a consistent “top to bottom, front to back” order as I recorded them. So although each &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; of 36 packs in this data set definitely come from the same box, the &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; of packs within each group of 36 does not necessarily correspond to the order in which the packs were filled at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, if the objective of this experiment were to obtain a representative “truly random” sample of packs of Skittles, then the above behavior suggests that buying these 36-pack boxes in bulk is probably not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one additional caveat: fortunately the primary objective of this experiment was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to obtain a “truly random” sample, but only to confirm the predicted “ease” with which we could find a pair of identical packs of Skittles. However, suppose that we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to use this data set as a “truly random” sample… and further suppose that we could eliminate the practical imperfections suggested above, so that each pack was indeed a theoretically perfect, independent random sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then even in this clean room thought experiment, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a problem: by stopping our sampling procedure upon encountering a duplicate, we have biased the distribution of possible resulting sample data sets! This can perhaps be most clearly seen with a simpler setup that allows an analytical solution: suppose that each pack contains just &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;n=2&quot; title=&quot;n=2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; Skittles, and each individual Skittle is independently equally likely to be one of just &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;d=2&quot; title=&quot;d=2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; possible colors, red or green. If we collect any &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; number of sample packs, then we should expect to observe an “all-red” pack with two red Skittles exactly 1/4 of the time. But if we instead collect sample packs until we observe a first duplicate, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; count the fraction that are all red, the expected value of this fraction is slightly less than 1/4 (181/768, to be exact). That is, by stopping with a duplicate, we are less likely to even get a chance to observe the more rare all-red (or all-green) packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting problem to quantify the extent of this effect (which I suspect is vanishingly small) with actual packs of Skittles, where the numbers of candies are larger, and the probabilities of those “extreme” compositions such as all reds is so small as to be effectively zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;91.968045112782&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A host of&lt;/strong&gt; popular Android apps from a major Chinese developer, including a selfie app with more than 50 million downloads, have been committing large-scale ad fraud and abusing user permissions, a BuzzFeed News investigation of popular Android apps has found. In several cases, the apps took steps that concealed their connections to the developer, DU Group, to users and failed to clearly disclose they were collecting and sending data to China. The investigation also raises questions about Google's policing of apps in the Play store for fraud and data collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group is a Chinese app developer that claims more than 1 billion users worldwide, and was spun off from Baidu, one of China’s largest tech companies, last year. At least six of DU Group’s apps, which together have more than 90 million downloads from the Google Play store, have been fraudulently clicking on ads to generate revenue, and at least two of them contain code that could be used to engage in a different form of ad fraud, according to findings from security and ad fraud researchers Check Point and Method Media Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DU Group apps were identified after BuzzFeed News gathered a list of close to 5,000 popular apps from the Google Play store, along with associated information, such as the developer’s name, number of installs, and requested permissions. Apps that asked for a suspiciously large number of user permissions, or permissions deemed potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#dangerous_permissions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“dangerous”&lt;/a&gt; by Android, were provided to researchers at several data analysis and security firms. (For a more detailed description of the methodology, see the bottom of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t limited to DU Group, however. Other Android apps with a high number of unnecessary permissions identified by BuzzFeed News include a hugely popular TV remote app that says it might use a phone’s microphone to record sound while a user watches TV, a Chinese-language kids app that sent personal information without any encryption to servers in China, and a flashlight app that took dozens of unnecessary and potentially invasive permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate how Google’s Play store, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessofapps.com/guide/app-stores-list/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; app store in the world, has been exploited by developers who easily conceal who they are from users, offer apps with invasive permissions, and use these permissions to commit ad fraud — all while collecting huge amounts of user data. The result is an app ecosystem that’s easily taken advantage of to abuse users and steal money from advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google told BuzzFeed News that it has blacklisted the six DU Group apps found committing ad fraud. This means they can no longer use any of Google’s ad products to earn money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We explicitly prohibit ad fraud and service abuse on Google Play. Developers are required to disclose the collection of personal data, and only use permissions that are needed to deliver the features within the app,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “If an app violates &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our policies&lt;/a&gt;, we take action that can include banning a developer from being able to publish on Play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s Play store, the largest app store in the world, has been exploited by developers who easily conceal who they are from users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;84.679611650485&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DU apps in question also violate the Play store policy against apps that “misrepresent or conceal their ownership,” given that they do not disclose any connection to DU Group to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initially stating that the apps in question would remain in its store while it investigated, shortly before this article's publication a Google spokesperson confirmed they have now been removed. The company would not say if it plans to take action against DU Group overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before Google responded to BuzzFeed News’ questions about app permissions and developers concealing their identity, the company also published &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-update-process-with-your.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining a new approach to user permissions and measures “to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems.” It said it will be hiring more people to evaluate apps for the Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group did not respond to multiple emails requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Kramer, a senior analyst of Arete Research, told BuzzFeed News Google isn’t doing enough to protect users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot separate the behaviour of DU — spun out of Baidu a year ago, in which they still own 34% — from the US-listed parent,” he said in an email. “Ad fraud is simply the norm in China (and for many other apps), and ... Google should be doing far more to prevent it, even if it would materially reduce sales. They cannot claim ignorance of, or deny the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group’s ad fraud follows on previous BuzzFeed News reporting that revealed two other prominent Chinese Android app developers, Cheetah Mobile and Kika Tech, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/android-apps-cheetah-mobile-kika-kochava-ad-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;were abusing user permissions to engage in ad fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that investigation, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/mark-warner-cheetah-mobile-chinese-apps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said Chinese mobile app companies pose a national security risk&lt;/a&gt; due to their voracious data collection and Chinese laws that make them “ultimately beholden to the Communist Party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All this information is ending back up in data repositories in China. Beyond the [ad] fraud, just all the personal information that is being collected on Americans” is a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Simmons, the head of client analytics for the app analysis and attribution company Kochava, said the behaviors identified in this investigation often occur in the background when a user isn’t using the app in question. He compared it to “having downloaded an app that operates as a Trojan horse for the purposes of data collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“End users are not aware of how data is generated by the apps they use — and how frequently the data generated is used for ad fraud or further privacy violations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of app privacy policies by Privacy International found many identified in this research were confusing or inadequate, and raised questions about when they share data with government authorities and other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beyond questions of legal compliance, companies need to stop exploiting people’s data,” said Frederike Kaltheuner, the data program lead of Privacy International. “What happens to your data matters, because it can be used against you or for purposes that you fundamentally disagree with. At the moment you often have to [be] an expert to understand what happens to your data —  with whom it’s shared, sold, and by whom it’s exploited. That’s a huge problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A family of apps committing ad fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pic.mycamera&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selfie Camera&lt;/a&gt; app had been installed more than 50 million times from the Google Play store, and maintained a 4.5-star rating after tens of thousands of reviews. In 2017, Google listed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/best-apps-of-2017-revealed-by-google/ar-BBG6WGe?li=BBnbklF&amp;amp;%25252525253Bocid=LENDHP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as one of the most popular new apps in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Those stats made it seem like a safe bet for users, but three different researchers found problems with the app that make it a risk to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most alarmingly, Check Point found the app contains code that causes it to fraudulently click on ads in the app without the user’s knowledge. The company’s researchers documented fake clicks taking place with ads served by AdMob and MoPub, the mobile ad networks operated by Google and Twitter, respectively. (MoPub and Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraudulent clicks even occur when the app isn’t open, which can drain a phone’s battery and consume data, according to Aviran Hazum, the analysis and response team leader for Check Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His team documented the app “checking if [a] user hasn’t clicked on an ad yet [and then] clicking at random intervals” on ads to generate fraudulent revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you can say is in the gray area — it's a clear-cut fraudulent activity,” he told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selfie Camera is one of six apps owned by DU Group that Check Point found engaged in fake ad clicking. The other apps were Omni Cleaner, RAM Master, Smart Cooler, Total Cleaner, and AIO Flashlight. They had been installed more than 40 million times from the Google Play store prior to being removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;45.708396946565&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google said this form of “click fraud” is rare and against its policies, which is why it blacklisted all six apps from its ad products. The company pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/ads/enabling-safe-digital-advertising-ecosystem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; about action it took in 2018 against malicious ads and actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with committing ad fraud, the apps also concealed their connection to DU Group from users. In Google’s Play store, all of the above apps (except for AIO Flashlight) list their developer as “Pic Tools Group (Photo Editor&amp;amp; Photo Grid&amp;amp;Collage).” There are no references to DU Group, or Baidu, on the apps' descriptions within the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It provides a layer of obscurity for the user,” Hazum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-image xs-mb4 xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 md-col-6 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-pr3 subbuzz-image--align-left&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;121.53659052453&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s developer policy does not allow “apps or developer accounts that impersonate any person or organization, or that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose ... or conceal their country of origin and that direct content at users in another country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the above apps, Selfie Camera raised the most concerns among researchers. In addition to the fake clicks documented by Check Point, Method Media Intelligence identified code in the app that could enable app attribution ad fraud. Praneet Sharma of MMI said, “There is a clear pattern of using certain packages that game install attribution and ad calls,” and warned of the “immense and dangerous amount of permissions” in this and other apps he examined. (Sharma did not see the app committing attribution ad fraud.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribution ad fraud, which BuzzFeed News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/android-apps-cheetah-mobile-kika-kochava-ad-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; was committed by Cheetah Mobile and Kika Tech, is used to falsely claim credit for app installations. Developers often pay a “bounty” to partners who help drive new installations of their products. In this case the selfie app from DU Group contained code enabling it to detect when someone downloaded a new app to their phone, and could be used to help claim any bounty on an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ad fraud activity, the app also comes bundled with unrelated — and undisclosed — features, documented in user complaints on Play store reviews and an analysis by Eset, a security firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Completely false advertisement ... it has a bunch of hidden ‘performance enhancements’ for my phone that only screw it up more. I'll be reporting this as it needs to be in the description,” read a recent review from Duncan Mugume, a user in Uganda who told BuzzFeed News he downloaded the app after seeing an online ad for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in a Facebook message that after he installed the app it “behaved completely different” than expected, including running “scans” of his phone while it was not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukas Stefanko, a malware researcher with Eset, examined the app for BuzzFeed News and found it contains a wide range of functionality not revealed to the user in the Play store, including a hidden battery monitor, CPU cooler, and the ability to view external websites, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefanko said this extra functionality adds vulnerabilities because the app could be used to load malicious links. (He did not witness any such activity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One puzzling behavior by many of DU Group’s unbranded apps is that their privacy policies werere hosted on Tumblr blogs with strange names. Selfie Camera hosts its policy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/FulRs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreamilyswimmingwizard.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; while other apps have policies at &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/qhDy2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yesexactlyinnerbouquetstuff.tumblr.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/jIWqw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superiorzzr.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies don’t reveal that the user’s data is being collected by DU Global, adding yet another layer of obfuscation. Kaltheuner, of Privacy International, told BuzzFeed News the policies are vague about how third parties, including potentially the Chinese government or other authorities, can gain access to the data being collected. She also said the policy for Selfie Camera incorrectly claims it does not collect personal data. Under GDPR, the European data legislation, a device ID is considered personal data, and Selfie Camera collects this from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One DU Group app that is explicit about user data being sent to China is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meet.android&amp;amp;hl=es&amp;amp;source=freeapkdescaragr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet&lt;/a&gt; chat app. Like others, it does not list DU Group anywhere on its Play store listing. But it says in its privacy policy that “it may require us to transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the European Economic Area ... including to countries such as the People’s Republic of China or Singapore.” (The researchers did not identify any ad fraud taking place in Meet.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashlight apps taking permissions, engaging in ad fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Android phones ship with a built-in flashlight, making these apps largely unnecessary. Yet many third-party lights boast millions of installs, and have in the past been used as a Trojan horse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2016/06/24/new-godless-android-malware-running-rampant-over-850000-devices-affected/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deliver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2018/01/05/millions-android-users-downloaded-malicious-flashlight-apps-google-play/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; or engage in ad fraud by loading ads in the background without a user’s knowledge. BuzzFeed News’ investigation identified multiple flashlight apps that requested a suspiciously high number of permissions from users, and/or were engaged in ad fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Flashlight app developers] took advantage of a window of opportunity when iPhones and Android devices did not have built-in flashlight functionality, so real humans downloaded flashlight apps that asked for insane permissions and few noticed since they just gave all permissions when installing,” Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher, told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-image xs-mb4 xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 md-col-6 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-pr3 subbuzz-image--align-left&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;65.947465437788&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, the AIO Flashlight from DU Group was part of the group of apps fraudulently clicking on ads. It also took 31 permissions, seven of which are in the dangerous group. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emoji.flashlight&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emoji Flashlight&lt;/a&gt;, from APUS Apps of China, has over 5 million installs and took 30 permissions, of which seven are in the dangerous group — far more than are needed to function. How many permissions does a flashlight app actually need? &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humberto.flashlight&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This app&lt;/a&gt; in the Play store took just two permissions and does the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A request for comment sent to the email address listed on the Emoji Flashlight’s Play store page did not receive a reply. Emails to APUS Apps also went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A TV remote that says it might use your phone mic to record what you watch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the most invasive apps identified in the investigation belonged to Chinese companies, one American-made app stood out for its dragnet data collection policy and high number of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peel.samsungtv'&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Samsung TV Remote Control&lt;/a&gt; app from Peel Technologies took 58 permissions, 23 of which are in the dangerous category defined by Android. The app is one of a family of TV remote applications from Peel that have similar functionality and permissions. They are all covered by a single privacy policy that says the app collects detailed information about the “content you consume (validated by audio content recognition).” This suggests the app accesses the microphone to record audio while you use it. It also collects information on your location, IP address, device, and behavior when you use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email response, Peel said its apps do not perform audio content recognition, but did not respond to a follow-up question about why that feature is cited in its privacy policy. It also said it only shares “Non-Personally Identifiable Location data for a fraction of our users” with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may not be a household name, the company is a global player. It has claimed a registered user base of more than 130 million people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peel#section-funding-rounds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised more than $86 million in venture capital&lt;/a&gt; funding. (Its most recent round of financing came in 2014 and was led by Chinese e-commerce and tech conglomerate Alibaba Group.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;91.745639534884&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason it has attracted so many users over its history is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-10.1-has-arrived-game-changing-device-hits-u.s.-store-shelves-tomorrow'&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt; Peel signed a deal to preinstall its apps on some Samsung phones. (It had a similar deal with handset maker HTC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Flynn, a management consultant in Brisbane, Australia, told BuzzFeed News that his Samsung Galaxy, purchased around 2015, came with a Peel remote app preinstalled. He recently became frustrated after the app kept taking over his screen with ads. The same happened to his mother-in-law, who also owns a Samsung Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That behavior was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wandera.com/mobile-security/mobile-malware/peel-tv-remote-adware/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by mobile security firm Wandera, which called out the Peel remote for “misusing permissions functionality and aggressively advertising to its users.” Peel initially said its apps “do not do any advertisements at the moment.” However, BuzzFeed News found at least four of its apps were offering inventory for advertisers to buy across several ad networks. The company then said it’s running “minor experiments running to find the right balance between interstitial [ads] and user churn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn was so frustrated by the adds that he tried to delete the app from his phone. But it kept reappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it came back, covering up our lock screens again, I was very frustrated,” he said. Flynn had to search online to find out how to disable the app and its many permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've since gone through, revoked all permissions, disabled auto updates,” he said. “The whole experience has put me off Samsung altogether. It's still there, and that annoys me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when it made life harder for an older lady who really struggles with technology, I was angry,” he said. “I've had an easier time removing viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He posted a review about his struggles in the Play store earlier this year to warn other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peel told BuzzFeed News its apps are no longer preinstalled on Samsung or HTC phones. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment, though the company continues to maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/disable-peel-remote/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an online help page&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to telling people how to disable the Peel TV remote app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A kids app sending personal data in the clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one kids app stood out among the apps that took unnecessary permissions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wawayaya.kids_iread.foreign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WaWaYaYa app&lt;/a&gt; is a reading app for kids that offers Chinese-language content. It also took 32 permissions, seven of which are from the dangerous group. Most alarmingly, analysis from Stefanko of Eset found the app is sending user information such as an email, username, real name, and information about their device back to servers in China without encryption or other protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is only available in Chinese and has only been installed 1,000 times from the Play store. The developer of the app did not reply to a request for comment. ●&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we found the apps and analyzed them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, BuzzFeed News collected information from the US Google Play store on the top 600 free, paid, and highest-grossing Android apps in four categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/top&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/FAMILY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kids apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/TOOLS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;. Some apps appeared in multiple lists (i.e., both top-grossing games and top-grossing overall); in total, BuzzFeed News identified 4,880 apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the data that can be gleaned from the Play store are each app’s permissions. BuzzFeed News cross-referenced those permissions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android’s official documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which assigns certain permissions a “protection level” of “dangerous.” Such permissions tend to be those that provide access to sensitive information (text messages, body sensors, location, etc.) or those that have the ability to exert effects outside of the app (sending text messages, modifying contacts, creating voicemails, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News manually identified apps that requested a high number of permissions, including those assigned as “dangerous,” and began researching those that took more permissions than appeared to be required for them to function (such as flashlight apps). Apps that warranted technical examination were provided to Check Point, Method Media Intelligence, and Eset for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;To justify installing an independent chair, Trillium lists some missteps Zuckerberg has overseen during his monarchical reign. They include facilitating Russian meddling in U.S. elections, allowing the personal data of 87 million users to be accessed by Cambridge Analytica, allowing the proliferation of fake news and “propagating violence in Myanmar, India, and South Sudan,” and “allowing advertisers to exclude black, Hispanic, and other ‘ethnic affinities’ from seeing ads.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft turned down facial-recognition sales on human rights concerns</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-ai/microsoft-turned-down-facial-recognition-sales-on-human-rights-concerns-idUSKCN1RS2FV</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-ai/microsoft-turned-down-facial-recognition-sales-on-human-rights-concerns-idUSKCN1RS2FV</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp recently rejected a California law enforcement agency’s request to install facial recognition technology in officers’ cars and body cameras due to human rights concerns, company President Brad Smith said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft concluded it would lead to innocent women and minorities being disproportionately held for questioning because the artificial intelligence has been trained on mostly white and male pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has more cases of mistaken identity with women and minorities, multiple research projects have found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anytime they pulled anyone over, they wanted to run a face scan” against a database of suspects, Smith said without naming the agency. After thinking through the uneven impact, “we said this technology is not your answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Stanford University conference on “human-centered artificial intelligence,” Smith said Microsoft had also declined a deal to install facial recognition on cameras blanketing the capital city of an unnamed country that the nonprofit Freedom House had deemed not free. Smith said it would have suppressed freedom of assembly there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Microsoft did agree to provide the technology to an American prison, after the company concluded that the environment would be limited and that it would improve safety inside the unnamed institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith explained the decisions as part of a commitment to human rights that he said was increasingly critical as rapid technological advances empower governments to conduct blanket surveillance, deploy autonomous weapons and take other steps that might prove impossible to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in December it would be open about shortcomings in its facial recognition and asked customers to be transparent about how they intended to use it, while stopping short of ruling out sales to police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith has called for greater regulation of facial recognition and other uses of artificial intelligence, and he warned Tuesday that without that, companies amassing the most data might win the race to develop the best AI in a “race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shared the stage with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who urged tech companies to refrain from building new tools without weighing their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please embody the human rights approach when you are developing technology,” said Bachelet, a former president of Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to name the prospective customers the company turned down.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Should I Resign from My Full Professor Job to Work Fulltime on Cocalc?</title>
<link>http://blog.sagemath.com/2019/04/12/should-i-resign-from-my-full-professor-job-to-work-fulltime-on-cocalc.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.sagemath.com/2019/04/12/should-i-resign-from-my-full-professor-job-to-work-fulltime-on-cocalc.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 3 years ago, I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/talks/2016-06-sage-bp/&quot;&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; at a Harvard mathematics conference announcing that “I am leaving academia to build a company”. What I really did is go on &lt;em&gt;unpaid leave&lt;/em&gt; for three years from my tenured Full Professor position. No further extensions of that leave is possible, so I finally have to decide whether or not to go back to academia or resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-get-here&quot;&gt;How did I get here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two decades ago, as a recently minted Berkeley math Ph.D., I was hired as a non-tenure-track faculty member in the mathematics department at Harvard. I spent five years at Harvard, then I applied for jobs, and accepted a tenured Associate Professor position in the mathematics department at UC San Diego. The mathematics community was very supportive of my number theory research; I skipped tenure track, and landed a tier-1 tenured position by the time I was 30 years old. In 2006, I moved from UCSD to a tenured Associate Professor position at the University of Washington (UW) mathematics department, primarily because my wife was a graduate student there, UW has strong research in number theory and algebraic geometry, and they have a good culture supporting undergraduate research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left Harvard, I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sagemath.org&quot;&gt;SageMath open source software project&lt;/a&gt;, initially with the longterm goal of creating a free open source viable alternative to Mathematica, Maple, Matlab and Magma. As a result, in addition to publishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/papers/&quot;&gt;dozens of research mathematics papers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/books/&quot;&gt;some books&lt;/a&gt;, I also started spending a lot of my time writing software, and organizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops#Past_Workshops&quot;&gt;Sage Days workshops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recruiting-at-uw-mathematics&quot;&gt;Recruiting at UW Mathematics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UW, I recruited an amazing team of undergraduates and grad students who had a major impact on the development of Sage. I was blown away by the quality of the students (both undergrad and grad) that I was able to get involved in Sage development. I fully expected that in the next few years I would have the resources to hire some of these students to work fulltime on Sage. They had written the first versions of much of the core functionality of Sage (e.g., graph theory, symbolic calculus, matrices, and much more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when my application for Full Professor at UW was delayed for one year because – I was told – I wasn’t publishing enough research papers. This was because I was working very hard on building Sage, which was going extremely well at the time. I took the feedback seriously, and put more time into traditional research and publishing; this was the first time in my life that I did research mathematics for reasons other than just because I loved doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried very hard to hire &lt;a href=&quot;http://wbhart.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Bill Hart&lt;/a&gt; as a tenure-track faculty member at UW. However, I was told that his publication count was &lt;em&gt;“a bit light”&lt;/em&gt;, and I did not succeed at hiring him. If you printed out the source code of software he has written, it would be a tall stack of paper. In any case, I totally failed at the politics needed to make his case and was left dispirited, realizing my personal shortcomings at department politics meant I probably could not hire the sort of colleagues I desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UW was also very supportive of me teaching an undergrad course on open source math software (it evolved into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kedlaya/math157&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). I taught a similar course at the graduate level once, and it went extremely well, and was in my mind the best course I ever taught at UW. I was extremely surprised when my application to teach that grad course again was denied, and I was told that grad students should just go to my undergraduate course. I thought, “this is really strange”, instead of lobbying to teach the course and better presenting my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I do not mean to criticize the mathematics department. The UW math department has thought very hard and systematically about their priorities and how they fit into UW. They are a traditional &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; mathematics departments that is generally ranked around 25 in the country, with a particular set of strengths. There is a separate applied math department on campus, several stats departments, and a massive &lt;strong&gt;School&lt;/strong&gt; of Computer Science. Maybe I was in the wrong place to try to hire somebody whose main qualification is being world class at writing mathematical software. This blog post is about the question of whether the UW math department is the right place for me or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outside-grant-support&quot;&gt;Outside Grant Support?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My number theory research received incredible support from the NSF, with me being the PI on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/grants/&quot;&gt;six NSF grants&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au&quot;&gt;Magma&lt;/a&gt; (which is similar to Sage, but closed source) had managed to find sufficient government funding, so I remained optimistic. Maybe I could fund people to build Sage via grants, and even start an institute! I applied for grants to support work on SageMath at a larger scale, and had some initial success (half of a postdoc, and some workshops, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is grant funding so important for Sage? The goal of the SageMath project is to create free open source software that is a viable alternative to Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, and Magma – software produced by companies with a combined thousands of fulltime employees. Though initial progress was encouraging, it was clear that I desperately needed significant money to genuinely compete. For example, one Sage developer had a fantastic Sage development project he wanted about 20K to work fulltime on during a summer, and I could not find the money; as a result he quit working on Sage. This project involved implementing some deep algorithms that are needed to more directly compete with Mathematica for solving symbolic inequalities. This sort of thing happened over and over again, and it began to really frustrate me. I could get plenty of funding for 1-week workshops (just travel expenses – everybody works for free), but there’s only so much you can do at such sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept hearing that there would be a big one-in-10-years NSF institutes competition sometime in the “next year or two”. People hinted to me that this would be a good thing to watch out for, and I dreamed that I could found such an institute, with the mission to make it so the mathematics community finally owned the deep software on which teaching and research are based. This institute would bring the same openness and robustness to computational mathematics that rigorous proof had brought to mathematics itself a century earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, this did not happen. I remember the moment I found out about the actual NSF institutes competition. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/&quot;&gt;Joe Silverman&lt;/a&gt; was standing behind me at a coffee break at &lt;a href=&quot;http://swc.math.arizona.edu/aws/2010/index.html&quot;&gt;The Arizona Winter School 2010&lt;/a&gt; telling people about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://icerm.brown.edu/&quot;&gt;his proposal for ICERM&lt;/a&gt; had just won the NSF institutes competition. I spun around and congratulated him as I listened to how much work it was to put together the application during the last year; internally, my heart sunk. Not only did I not win, I didn’t even know the competition had happened! I guess I was too busy working on Sage. In any case, my fantasy of creating an NSF-funded institute died at that moment. Of course, ICERM has turned out to be a fantastic institute, and it has hosted several workshops that support the development of open source math software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, I also started &lt;a href=&quot;https://wstein.org/grants/&quot;&gt;having my grant proposals denied&lt;/a&gt; for reasons I do not understand. This was confusing to me, after having received so many NSF grants before. In 2012, the Simons Foundation put out a call for something that potentially addressed what I had hoped to accomplish via an NSF-funded institute. I was very excited again, but that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-simons-foundation-and-open-source.html&quot;&gt;did not turn out as I had hoped&lt;/a&gt;. So next I tried something I never thought I would ever do in a million years…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;commercialization-at-uw&quot;&gt;Commercialization at UW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, I failed to get the NSF or other foundations to fund Sage at the level I needed, so in 2013, I decided to try to sell a commercial product, and use the profits to fund Sage development. I first tried to do this at University of Washington, by working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://comotion.uw.edu/&quot;&gt;the commercialization office (C4C)&lt;/a&gt; to sell access to Sage online. As long as the business and product were merely abstract ideas (e.g., let’s make up a name and trademark it! let’s write some terms of service!) things went fine. However, when things became much more concrete, working with C4C got strange and frustrating for me. I was clearly missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the first thing C4C told me on the very first day we sat down together was they would not work with me if I made the software I wrote for this open source, and that the university would own the software. Given there was no software at all yet, and I imagined I would just whip out a quick modern web-based frontend to Sage and make boatloads of money that would go straight into a UW account to be used to fund Sage, this seemed fine to me. However, I had a nagging feeling that a pure closed-source approach to this problem was impossible, and not having that flexibility would come back to haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naively optimistic, I found myself working fulltime at UW and at the same time trying to get a sophisticated web application off the ground by myself, with many important early users depending on it for their classes. This was stressful and took an enormous amount of time and attention. I felt like I was just part of the software, often getting warnings that things were broken or breaking, and &lt;strong&gt;manually&lt;/strong&gt; fixing them. The toil was high, and only got worse as more people used the software. I would get woken up all night. I couldn’t travel since things were constantly breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every time I fought through some really difficult problem with the web application instead of just giving up, I came out far more determined not to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web application described above evolved over 6 years into what is now https://CoCalc.com; the functionality was pretty similar from day 1, but quality and scalability have come a long ways. CoCalc lets you collaboratively use LaTeX, Sage, Terminals, Jupyter Notebooks, etc., for teaching and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I went on sabbatical and worked fulltime developing this web application and the feedback loop I described above only grew more intense: fix things, fight through difficult problems, be even more determined not to give up. Fortunately, I had some leftover NSF grant funds, and was able to use them to hire several students to help with development. I failed to find students who I could hire to do the backend work (and be available any time day or night), which meant that much of the stress of keeping the site running continued to fall squarely on my shoulders. And as the site grew in popularity (and functionality), the stress from it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Sabbatical ended, and I was required to return to UW fulltime for one year, or return all the money I was paid during my sabbatical. So far, CoCalc had grown in popularity, but I had not been allowed by the “commercialization office” to actually commercialize it, so it was still a free site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught at UW at the same time as being the main person trying to run this very complicated and painful production web application. Based on user feedback, I was also highly motivated to improve CoCalc. I would typically sleep a few hours, get up at 3am and write code until 8am, then prepare to teach, hope not to have any site issues right before class, and so on. One day CoCalc got hit by a massive DDoS attack minutes before a class I was teaching, while I was talking with a prospective donor to the math department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the sort of person who does well focusing on exactly one thing at a time. Given the chance to fully focus on one thing for extended periods of time, I sometimes even do things that really matter and have an impact. I am not great at doing many different things at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Sage itself was growing and receiving funding, though this had nothing to do with me. For example, Gregg Musiker was putting together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ima.umn.edu/2017-2018.2/W8.21-25.17&quot;&gt;big program at IMA&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of a ton of Sage Days workshops. Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendreamkit.org/&quot;&gt;huge ODK project&lt;/a&gt;, which was a European Union grant proposal to support open source math software would be fully funded. And closer to home, Moore and Sloane funded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://escience.washington.edu/&quot;&gt;major new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that could potentially have also supported work on Sage. I was invited to go to workshops and events involving these and other grants, but often I either said no or canceled at the last minute due to the toil needed just to keep CoCalc running. Also, I believed if I could start charging customers, then I would have a lot more money, and could hire more help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with more senior people at UW’s C4C to finally actually charge people to use CoCalc. They wanted me to do some integration with their license management system, and sell “express” software licenses. It didn’t make any sense to me, and we went around in circles. I then asked about actually starting a separate company (a legal entity) that the university would have some ownership in, so that the company could take payments, etc. This is when things got really weird. They would not talk with me about creating the company due to “conflict of interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched for other UW faculty that had commercialized remotely similar products, and found one. He told me how it went, and said it was the worst experience of his life. UW owned 50% of the company, and all of the software of the company, which they licensed under onerous terms. They refused to negotiate anything with him, instead requiring his spinoff company to hire an outside negotiator. As a result of all this, I educated myself as much as possible about relevant rules and laws, and consulted with a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the NSF grants I used to fund work on CoCalc explicitly stipulated that code funded by those grants had to be GPL licensed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8967094&quot;&gt;This meant all the code for CoCalc had to be open sourced.&lt;/a&gt; Later the university even agreed in writing to release a snapshot of all the CoCalc code under the BSD license, and I haven’t been paid a penny by UW since the date of that release, so there is no possible claim that the company can’t use the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-company&quot;&gt;Building a company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine from when I was at Harvard was in town for a day, and we met for coffee. He expected we would talk about Sage and number theory, but instead I told him about CoCalc and my attempts at commercialization and starting a company. He immediately suggested a solution to my problems, which was to talk with a friend of his who had both extensive experience working with companies and deep connections with mathematics. I was confident that in the worst case I could quit my job at UW and rewrite all the software from scratch, so I took him up on the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I formed a corporation, and received some outside investment, and used that (and dramatically cutting my already-small academic income) to “leave academia”. More precisely, in 2016 (after working fulltime for a year at UW), I finally went on 100% unpaid leave from UW in order to completely focus on CoCalc development and getting a business off the ground. Also, there was no good reason to quit a tenured Full Professor job when you can go on leave; also CoCalc supports teaching in math departments, so it is closely related to my academic job. The only academic responsibilities I had were to my two Ph.D. students, who I meet with one-on-one at least once a week. At the end of two years, I requested a third year of unpaid leave, which UW granted (this is not routine). Throughout all this, the UW mathematics department was very supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these three years on unpaid leave, I’ve hired &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sagemath.com/cocalc/2018/09/10/where-is-cocalc-from.html&quot;&gt;three other people&lt;/a&gt; who work fulltime on CoCalc. Together we have massively improved the software, and built a business with thousands of paying customers. The company is still not profitable, though the future is clearly very bright if we continue what we are currently doing. CoCalc has become a platform that an increasing number of scalable products (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wit.io/portfolio/minerva-active-learning-forum&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) are being built with, and there is enormous growth potential in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/162#issue-248232293&quot;&gt;it rightfully appears to the community&lt;/a&gt; that I have left SageMath development to focus fulltime on building CoCalc as an independent business. Indeed, I do not spend any significant time contributing to Sage, and I even switched to getting daily digests of &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel&quot;&gt;the sage-devel mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as mentioned above, CoCalc is going well by many metrics (in terms of quality, feature development, customer love, market position, etc.). Most importantly, me and the other three people who work fulltime on CoCalc really, really love this job, and the potential to have a significant impact. I still don’t know if CoCalc will ever be wildly profitable and massively fund Sage development. If I were to obsess over only that goal, I would have to quit working on CoCalc (since it is taking way too long) and pursue other opportunities for funding Sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In retrospect, my idea from 7 years ago to start a web-based software company from scratch and build it into a successful profitable business has so far completely failed to fund Sage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be far easier to work fulltime writing grants to foundations, and leveraging the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigsam.org/awards/jenks/awardees/2013/&quot;&gt;acknowledged success&lt;/a&gt; of Sage so far. I made the wrong move, given my original goal. The surprise is that &lt;strong&gt;I really enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; what I’m doing right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-unpaid-leave-is-up--what-am-i-going-to-do&quot;&gt;My unpaid leave is up – what am I going to do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third year of unpaid leave from UW is up. I have to decide whether to return to UW or resign. If I return, it turns out that I would have to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ap.washington.edu/ahr/academic-titles-ranks/professor/&quot;&gt;at least a 50% appointment&lt;/a&gt;. I currently have 50% of one year of teaching in “credits”, which means I wouldn’t be required to teach for the first year I go back as a 50% appointment. Moreover, the current department chair (John Palmieri) understands and appreciates Sage – he is among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sagemath/sage/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;top 10 all time contributors to the source code of Sage&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to resign. I’m worried about issues of intellectual property; it would be extremely unfair to my employees, investors and customers if I took a 50% UW position, and then later got sued by UW as a result. Having a 50% paid appointment at UW subjects one to a lot of legal jeopardy, which is precisely why I have been on 100% unpaid leave for the last three years. But more importantly, I feel very good about continuing to focus 100% on the development of CoCalc, which is going to have an incredible year going forward. I genuinely love building this (non-VC funded) company, and feel very good about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the Instagram founders really quit</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;bMyTkj&quot;&gt;Last year, in an effort to give shape to &lt;em&gt;The Interface&lt;/em&gt;’s coverage area, I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface&quot;&gt;a public list of questions&lt;/a&gt; that I hoped to investigate over time. I saved my favorite one for last: why did Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger really leave Instagram?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yuIf3v&quot;&gt;In the months since the co-founders abruptly quit, we’ve gotten more details about the split. We learned that increasing tension with Facebook, combined with an unusually long post-acquisition tenure at their acquirer, had made them antsy. But we still never knew what &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; led them to resign, or why it was announced in such a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ag7mcN&quot;&gt;Today, with the publication of Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-fresh-hell/&quot;&gt;12,000-word account of Facebook’s past year and a half&lt;/a&gt;, I am happy to say that the mystery is now solved. Drawing on interviews with 65 current and former employees, the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; authors paint a detailed picture of the steps leading to Systrom and Krieger’s departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ju8WIv&quot;&gt;According to their reporting, the timeline goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;cyngX0&quot;&gt;Instagram’s rapid rise bred resentment at Facebook, where some top executives came to feel that the acquisition was siphoning growth and engagement away from the core Facebook app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;77kFJI&quot;&gt;As Mark Zuckerberg prepared to reorganize his executive team for the first time ever, the Instagram founders pushed for then-News Feed chief Adam Mosseri to be their official delegate from the mothership. They liked him and thought he could be an effective buffer against intrusive Facebook demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;zsAHDE&quot;&gt;After Systrom participated in magazine profiles, Zuckerberg declared that no one else could do so without permission from him or Sheryl Sandberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;ysRy2o&quot;&gt;In an earnings call in July 2018, Zuckerberg took credit for Instagram’s success, saying “We believe Insta­gram has been able to use Facebook’s infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;lwZ9vO&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg then charged his then-head of growth, Javier Olivan, to make a list of all the ways Facebook boosted Instagram’s growth. Some of those supports included a tag on Instagram photos shared to Facebook noting where they had originally been posted, and allowing Instagram to use a person’s Facebook friends to suggest Instagram follows for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;HoS5jy&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg then told Systrom he was taking away all those supports, apparently to protect the health of the Facebook app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;5O8tED&quot;&gt;Systrom sent a memo to Instagram employees informing them that Zuckerberg was taking away the growth tools, saying he opposed them but the company had no choice but go along. Facebook was terrified the memo would leak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;QVsBji&quot;&gt;Systrom then immediately peaced out for a few months of paternity leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;C43xAI&quot;&gt;With Systrom on leave, Facebook began testing location tracking and a disgusting hamburger button inside Instagram, offending Systrom’s delicate sensibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;Wz2WeJ&quot;&gt;Systrom began to suspect that Zuckerberg was intent on making him miserable enough that he would quit. (See: hamburger button.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;VUvlI7&quot;&gt;Systrom and Krieger decided to quit soon after the former came back from paternity leave. After they informed their team that they intended to leave, the news leaked to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, blindsiding the communications team and forcing Facebook to rush up a hurried goodbye. (The rush job was one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/kevin-systrom-very-nearly-tells-the-truth-139677&quot;&gt;the main lingering mysteries about the departure&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;UrjnGc&quot;&gt;I find all of this ... highly plausible? It’s also somewhat tragic: as the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story notes, Instagram’s design has made it harder for bad actors to misuse it, and it retains an appeal for North American users that the core Facebook app has long since squandered. You can debate how much Facebook contributed to Instagram’s success — and surely it contributed &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; — but Systrom and Krieger had unshakeable beliefs about app design that served them very well, and now that they’re gone all that is left is for Instagram to become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17903556/instagram-founders-quit-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-facebook&quot;&gt;a reskinned version of the Facebook app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fntm5e&quot;&gt;As for the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; piece, it could serve as a nice introduction to Facebook’s past year and a half for anyone who hasn’t been following along with &lt;em&gt;The Interface&lt;/em&gt;. The authors gamely try to weave a thread through Cambridge Analytica, the challenges of content moderation, executive departures, the future of the news industry, Joel Kaplan’s malign influence, fights among the communications team, Zuckerberg’s comments about the Holocaust, last fall’s data breach, the Definers scandal, the Facebook Research app scandal, and the creeping threat of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Likjbb&quot;&gt;My main takeaway is that an app that has 2.7 billion users is going to have a lot of things happening inside it, and to it, and that it might make a good subject for a daily newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ra4Ztb&quot;&gt;In any case, I am glad that a core mystery about Facebook’s past year and a half can now officially be said to be closed. Facebook surely runs smoother now that recalcitrant product leaders like Systrom and Krieger (and WhatsApp’s Jan Koum and Brian Acton) have left the company. Whether it runs better, though, is still an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;WConoY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YvPKmf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-fight-rivals-help-friends-n994706?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of leaked Facebook documents show Mark Zuckerberg as ‘master of leverage’ in plan to trade user data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lonY1X&quot;&gt;Olivia Solon and Cyrus Farivar report on a leak of more documents produced in discovery for the Pikini lawsuit that we’ve written about a few times around here. Main takeaway: Facebook considered selling user data more seriously than was previously known. (Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252461648/Facebook-takes-extraordinary-legal-steps-to-contain-document-leak?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;is also taking legal action against developer Six4Three&lt;/a&gt;, which it believes leaked the documents to reporters. It could result in jail time for the leakers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TQYZll&quot;&gt;Still, these freshly leaked documents show that the plans to sell access to user data were discussed for years and received support from Facebook’s most senior executives, including Zuckerberg, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox and VP of growth Javier Olivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;llikU8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-2020-plan-target-seniors-on-facebook-1555346862-b3bc5987-9e98-4837-9e55-aa479909ceb8.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=twsocialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s 2020 plan: Target seniors on Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KxUSGM&quot;&gt;If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. (On the other side of the aisle, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/tech/aoc-quit-facebook-just-like-me/index.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_content=2019-04-16T00%3A00%3A05&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twbusiness&amp;amp;utm_term=image&quot;&gt;just deactivated her personal account.)&lt;/a&gt; Sara Fischer reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GXFqOw&quot;&gt;The Trump campaign is spending nearly half (44%) of its Facebook ad budget to target users who are over 65 years old, as opposed to Democratic candidates who are only spending 27% of their budget on that demographic, according to data given to Axios exclusively from Bully Pulpit Interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fdqxrg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410610/russia-internet-traffic-law-surveillance-parliament?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian lawmakers approve plan to take more control over internet traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wIZRkZ&quot;&gt;The Russian internet is rapidly becoming a mirror of China’s, Colin Lecher reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yZBF0r&quot;&gt;Under the proposal, Russian internet traffic would be required to be sent through servers in the country, according to the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, giving the country more leverage to surveil and censor information. The bill was approved by the State Duma, and it will now head to the upper legislative chamber before going to President Putin’s desk for a signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SLMrVq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-india-court/google-blocks-chinese-app-tiktok-in-india-after-court-order-idUSKCN1RS1HT?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google blocks Chinese app TikTok in India after court order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q43Jop&quot;&gt;I’m legitimately surprised that this happened to TikTok before larger platforms like YouTube. Does the Indian government want to strangle India in its crib? I’d also note that the ban stems from some rather vague concerns — you’d think the government would tie the ban to a high-profile incident rather than generic worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HaCnMO&quot;&gt;Google has blocked access to the hugely popular video app TikTok in India to comply with a state court’s directive to prohibit its downloads, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0enmFi&quot;&gt;The move comes hours after a court in southern Tamil Nadu state refused a request by China’s Bytedance Technology to suspend a ban on its TikTok app, putting its future in one of its key markets in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SIqA9y&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/twitter-left-up-ilhan-omar-death-threats-so-law-enforcement?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter Left Up Ilhan Omar Death Threats So Law Enforcement Could Investigate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pjKbg9&quot;&gt;Alex Kantrowitz reports on an unintended consequence of Twitter’s policy around removing tweets containing death threats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17.613365155131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6tnXGI&quot;&gt;Twitter would’ve typically taken down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments/1117202995962212352?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;threatening tweets&lt;/a&gt; once they were reported, but the company left them up to enable potential law enforcement collaboration, a source close to the company told BuzzFeed News. The Capitol Hill police are working on the issue, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ss8G4b&quot;&gt;The incident highlights Twitter’s flawed approach to dealing with death threats on its platform. Instead of reporting death threats to law enforcement as a policy, Twitter simply deletes them. This means its users can make these threats with little fear of retribution, since the tweets usually disappear before police can review them. “This creates incentives for users of the platform,” a Democratic congressional aide told BuzzFeed News. “There’s a reason people on this platform feel comfortable making open death threats to Ilhan Omar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;xoHIDJ&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey sat for an uncomfortable interview at TED on Tuesday. Among other things, he discussed a blog post the company put out today &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/health-update.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;noting some progress in fighting abuse on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;oqfc5O&quot;&gt;Emily Dreyfuss notes a dramatic moment at Dorsey’s TED interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yNPKUh&quot;&gt;In his signature black hoodie and jeans, unkempt facial hair and black beanie, he sat with head of TED Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers, who curates current affairs for the conference, for a conversation that left all three members, and the audience, frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lSexKL&quot;&gt;“We’re on this great voyage with you on the Twittanic,” Anderson told Dorsey after roughly 20 minutes of interrupted back and forth. “There are people in steerage who are saying, ‘We are worried about the iceberg ahead!’ And you say, ‘That is a good point’ and ‘our boat hasn’t been built to handle it,’ and we’re waiting, and you are showing this extraordinary calm and we’re all worried but we’re outside saying, ‘Jack, turn the fucking wheel!’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8yhZwf&quot;&gt;Journalist Carole Cadwalladr appeared at TED this week to discuss social networks with her customary restraint. Ina Fried reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nx0jPN&quot;&gt;She specifically singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as “accessories” to “subversion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lPecOs&quot;&gt;She called on Facebook to reveal more of what happened in Brexit and the 2016 U.S. elections. “It’s a crime scene and you have the evidence,” she said. “It’s not enough to say you will do better in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;SHYtm3&quot;&gt;Discord’s hate-speech problem doesn’t seem to be getting any better, Mark Di Stefano and Alex Wickham report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;TaIllR&quot;&gt;In one discussion in a channel called #the-temple-of-veethena-nike from March 2019 about the new copyright law approved by the European Parliament, members talked about killing pro-EU politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;l5Wn35&quot;&gt;No, you’re not misremembering the details from that young adult dystopian fiction you’re reading — Facebook really does sell a video chat camera adept at tracking the faces of you and your loved ones. Now, you too can own &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/facebook-portal-are-you-serious-rn/?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Facebook’s poorly timed foray&lt;/a&gt; into social hardware for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.facebook.com%2Fproducts%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DThe%2520Interface%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DRevue%2520newsletter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;low, low price of $99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a pretty big price drop considering that the Portal, introduced less than six months ago, debuted at $199.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AjJj0e&quot;&gt;YouTube may want to think through whether it wants banned users to appear in videos created by the platform’s stars. Julia Alexander reports on Alex Jones’ cozying up to Logan Paul:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5369458128079&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f3PjjW&quot;&gt;This marked the second time in a month that Jones was allowed to appear on a popular YouTube personality’s channel, following a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alex-jones-completely-loses-it-again-during-marathon-joe-rogan-podcast-2019-02-28?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;four-hour appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; in February. During his latest appearance, Jones discussed dangerous conspiracy theories, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13870990/pizzagate-robertas-brooklyn-conspiracy-theory?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Pizzagate&lt;/a&gt; and misinformation about autism. These are examples of conspiracy theories that YouTube has spent time trying to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IsxmQm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/14/trivia-game-of-thrones/?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutiny at HQ Trivia fails to oust CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EbuKJl&quot;&gt;I wanted to write a lead column about HQ’s sad decline, and perhaps I’ll still get around to it. But in the meantime read Josh Constine’s absolutely wild account of the startup’s past five months, which have been more dramatic than any social-media since &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal%2Fdp%2F1591847087%3Futm_campaign%3DThe%2520Interface%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DRevue%2520newsletter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peak boardroom-drama Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bHrgVM&quot;&gt;By February 2019, HQ’s staff was fed up. Two sources confirm that 20 of the roughly 35 employees signed a letter asking the board to remove Yusupov and establish a new CEO. With HQ’s download rate continuing to sink, they feared he’d run the startup into the ground. One source suggested Yusupov might rather have seen the whole startup come crashing down with the blame placed on the product than have it come to light that he played a large hand in the fall. The tone of the letter, which was never formally delivered but sources believe the board knew of, wasn’t accusatory but a plea for transparency about the company’s future and the staff’s job security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aReehP&quot;&gt;At a hastily convened all-hands meeting in late February, HQ investor Liew told the company his fund Lightspeed would support a search for a new CEO to replace Yusupov, and provide that new CEO with funding for 18 more months of runway. Liew told the staff he would step down from the board once that CEO was found, but the search continues and so Liew remains on HQ’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;7YoKPu&quot;&gt;Despite HQ’s struggles, it still can be valuable to advertisers, Kerry Flynn reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13.484848484848&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RyScN0&quot;&gt;To sell sponsorships, HQ’s team touts the game’s concurrent viewership. HQ hasn’t been able to reach the same heights it had in 2018 — the game peaked with 2.4 million concurrent viewers last March during a game with a $250,000 jackpot — but it still attracts hundreds of thousands per game. For example, HQ’s “The Twilight Zone” game had about 478,000 viewers at question one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;amp;v=tsUe5qU3tdQ&quot;&gt;according to a recording of the game&lt;/a&gt;. HQ’s team compares that to current viewership on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/facebooks-confetti-and-the-q-has-been-growing-hq-trivia-competitors-overseas/?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Facebook’s knockoff trivia games&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter’s live shows, which have concurrent viewers in the tens of thousands compared to hundreds of thousands on HQ, sources familiar with the discussions told Digiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4vLzxi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gIklp4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410692/avengers-endgame-twitter-emoji-korg-thanos?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter introduces 40 adorable Avengers emoji, including Korg from Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sV73lE&quot;&gt;Twitter might be slow to addressing any of your personal concerns about the platform and its relationship to democracy, but it’s moving fast when it comes to big movie tie-ins. Julia Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15.897755610973&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0wGTJC&quot;&gt;Marvel Studios partnered with pop artist Truck Torrence to create the Twitter emoji seen in the photo below. The obvious superheroes are there — Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor, and Hawkeye — along with newcomers like the cast of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977756/black-panther-movie-review-ryan-coogler-marvel-cinematic-universe-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Captain Marvel, and Thanos himself. Most importantly, there are two emoji for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/6/16613050/thor-ragnarok-korg?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Korg and Miek&lt;/a&gt;, the best characters from &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Teg5Kj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9cGVPL&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/opinion/privacy-technology.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Is Too Big to Understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KzBvR1&quot;&gt;Charlie Warzel calls for a new definition of privacy in his new newsletter, which you should subscribe to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O0CO94&quot;&gt;At its heart, privacy is about how that data is used to take away our control. Today, our control is chipped away in ways large and small. It may be as innocuous as using your listed preferences, browsing behavior, third-party information about your annual income and a rough understanding of the hours that you’re most susceptible to make a purchase to nudge you toward buying a pair of shoes. Or it may be as potentially life-altering as the inability to get a loan or see a job listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N9pmRU&quot;&gt;For survivors of abuse, privacy might mean the freedom to live safely without exposing sensitive location information to stalkers. For undocumented immigrants, digital privacy could mean the difference between a parent being able to drop her child off at school or rush a loved one to the hospital without fear of deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MaNGYE&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/facebook-private-groups-online-abuse?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Groups Might Be The Last Good Thing About Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6slaWx&quot;&gt;Anne Helen Peterson writes about the positive impact that running a Facebook group has had on her life and work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tqYKSo&quot;&gt;I started the original group in 2009, and have never monetized it. I do it because I really, really like it, and the people who are part of it tell me they really, really like it too. It’s a place where I feel like I can ask questions, or for help working through an idea that’s not quite there yet. Members come from all over the world, and, according to Facebook’s analytics, 81% identify as women. Men periodically post in the comments. But they recognize, in a way I rarely see online, that their opinions are secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KoSkpE&quot;&gt;For many of us, these groups are one of the few remaining things tethering us to a platform that’s proven itself ineffective at combating toxicity, misinformation, and abuse in nearly every way. They provide community for people from all over the world, doing a bunch of different stuff, with a bunch of different and intersecting identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lArZ9K&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cyU0rd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onezero.medium.com/how-hedgehogs-became-instagrams-most-miserable-celebrities-5323aec461b4?gi=35224c346144&amp;amp;utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Hedgehogs Became Instagram’s Most Miserable Celebrities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bYR5wq&quot;&gt;Hedgehogs are tiny and have salmonella and you should NOT snuggle with them, Eliza Brooke reports. But that hasn’t stopped them from becoming popular on Instagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;P2tif4&quot;&gt;“Hedgehogs and small exotic animals are often impulse purchases, so when [people] see a video of them eating a tiny birthday cake with a hat, you’re not actually getting that when you get your pet,” says Schindler. “Social media has encouraged ownership of animals that isn’t realistic for what they’re going to end up with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iHReQN&quot;&gt;After hearing that a few people had gotten hedgehogs because of Lionel, Mathias took it upon herself to post about the realities of hedgehog care on her website. “They’re real animals and come with a lot of responsibility,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ryDYBO&quot;&gt;Please read this story before you buy a hedgehog!&lt;/p&gt;
