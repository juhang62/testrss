&lt;p&gt;Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, speaks to the media before the opening of the Berlin representation of Google Germany in Berlin on January 22, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is getting rid of one of its best-known workplace features: TGIF, its weekly all-hands meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company confirmed to CNBC that it will instead hold monthly all-hands meetings that will be focused on business and strategy while holding separate town halls for &quot;workplace issues.&quot; An email announcing the change was previously reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966718/google-weekly-all-hands-tgif-staff-meeting-changes-ceo-sundar-pichai&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started TGIFs in 1999 as a forum where employees could regularly express concerns and discuss topics open and freely with management. At that time, the company was small enough to fit in a meeting room, but the all-hands continued to grow as the employee base grew — until recently, that is. Page and Brin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/elusive-google-co-founders-make-rare-appearance-at-town-hall-meeting/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;stopped attending regularly in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. A company spokesperson said that the meetings had recently become a biweekly instead of weekly occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model comes as the company cracks down on the open work culture that's long been part of its identity of holding free discussion. Employees have increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/google-employees-walk-out-in-protest-of-sexual-misconduct-handling.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;voiced their concerns&lt;/a&gt; about everything from the handling of sexual harassment to government hires and contracts. In recent months, employees have leaked meeting notes to the media, which have shown growing tension between executives and workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the summer, Google said it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/google-bans-political-discussion-on-internal-mailing-lists.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;ban&lt;/a&gt; political discussions from internal messaging forums. In late October, CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/sundar-pichai/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt; said, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/25/google-ceo-leaked-video-says-company-is-genuinely-struggling-with-employee-trust/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;leaked video&lt;/a&gt;, that the company was &quot;genuinely struggling&quot; with employee trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In other places -- like TGIF -- our scale is challenging us to evolve,&quot; Pichai said in a memo to employees this week. &quot;TGIF has traditionally provided a place to come together, share progress, and ask questions, but it's not working in its current form.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his note, Pichai alluded to recent leaks that employees have given to the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're unfortunately seeing a coordinated effort to share our conversations outside of the company after every TGIF,&quot; the note reportedly states. &quot;I know this is new information to many of you, and it has affected our ability to use TGIF as a forum for candid conversations on important topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pichai's note also said that only 25% of Google employees watch TGIF any given week, compared with 80% a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People come to TGIF with different expectations,&quot; the note said. &quot;Some people come to hear more about Google's product launches and business strategies, others come to hear answers on other topics. By splitting the difference every week, we're not serving either purpose very well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The note said that Google's TGIF team will set up &quot;small group discussions&quot; for feedback on the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH NOW:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/01/google-employees-stage-global-walkout-and-ask-for-accountability.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google employees walk out to protest the handling of sexual harassment allegations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title> Jimmy Wales has quietly launched a Facebook rival</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/wikipedias-jimmy-wales-has-quietly-launched-a-facebook-rival-social-network/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/wikipedias-jimmy-wales-has-quietly-launched-a-facebook-rival-social-network/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has quietly rolled out a new social network that is intended to get right what Facebook and Twitter have so far been getting wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new social network, WT:Social, which Wales &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/1192160194693718017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;announced had 25,000 members on November 6&lt;/a&gt;, now has about 78,000 members who are at least intrigued by the idea of a social network that combats fake news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site goes against the ad-funded models normalized by Google, Facebook, and Twitter, instead asking users to pay a subscription fee to access information and communicate on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs $12.99 a month or $100 a year in the US, or €12 a month or €90 a year in Europe. It's £10 and £80 in the UK. In other words, about the same as a Netflix or Spotify subscription. However, questions remain over what content WT:Social can provide that users would be willing to part with money for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/topic/digital-transformation-a-cxos-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital transformation: A CXO's guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(ZDNet special report) |&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/digital-transformation-a-cxo-s-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download the report as a PDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(TechRepublic)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social network is a reboot of WikiTribune, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiTribune&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;launched in 2017 as a news-sharing service but didn't gain traction&lt;/a&gt; and ended up with Wales laying off several journalists it had hired. WikiTribune was launched off the back of a crowdfunding campaign.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wales &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/9956ff9c-0622-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot; data-component=&quot;externalLink&quot;&gt;spoke with the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; about the new project and the site's jarring proposition for consumers, or rather users, who expect social networks to be free. LinkedIn could be an exception here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_zd_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The business model of social-media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic,&quot; Wales told the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content,&quot; he added.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wales hopes WT:Social can attract 50 million or even half a billion users and points to the success of Netflix and Spotify in attracting people who are willing to pay for &quot;meaningful&quot; content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing up is free, but WT:Social has established a wait-list that paying donors can bypass. So far, just 200 people have paid to skip the waiting list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't expect the social network to be profitable but reckons it can be sustainable with its current barebones staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wales didn't go down the crowdfunding route this time and says he wants to &quot;keep a tight rein on the costs&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/most-americans-cant-recognize-2fa-https-or-private-browsing/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Americans can't recognize 2FA, HTTPS, or private browsing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the global news focus of WikiTribune, WT:Social aims to build smaller self-sustaining communities built around niche subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rather than hire moderators to monitor fake news as Facebook has, Wales' social network would rely on a community of users to enforce standards. Since all content on the platform can be edited or deleted by other users, he believes there's a good incentive for good behavior by users.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>To motivate people, talk about the context of the work to be done</title>
<link>https://www.sametab.com/blog/employee-engagement</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sametab.com/blog/employee-engagement</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sametab.com/blog/future-remote-working&quot;&gt;Manage by Context, not Control&lt;/a&gt;” I gave a long introductory premise explaining how the work paradigm has shifted. (If you haven’t read it yet, I would recommend giving that a read first as it instills some ground rules that will come in handy not only here but also in upcoming essays.) Specifically, I talked about how modern workers are not interchangeable anymore in terms of their skill level. Instead, they are increasingly specialized. As the world transitions to one of knowledge workers, skillsets are less interchangeable and way more specialized than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are the single most important asset in modern organizations. As talent scarcity is increasingly becoming one of the hardest problems, the ability to assess, &lt;em&gt;recruit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;retain&lt;/em&gt; talent is going to be an invaluable skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome talent scarcity more and more companies are adopting one or more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sametab.com/blog/frameworks-for-remote-working&quot;&gt;remote work frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, and with physical proximity out of the equation, the available talent pool is certainly way bigger. As more companies are beginning to embrace remote work, recruitment will get easier, but my hypothesis is that retaining talent will get considerably harder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, a remote environment removes friction. While this lack of friction comes with a lot of well-known benefits (competitive salary, flexible working hours, better individual time allocation, etc.), it also means that changing jobs will get easier and consequently, the ability to retain talent will matter a whole lot more in the future than it does today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this essay, we’re going to get acquainted with the prevailing wisdom on motivating and retaining employees, see if it’s still relevant, and arrive at some meaningful conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the write-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Effective Employee Engagement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to motivating and retaining employees there are two words that have been used by HR departments for years. Those words are “employee engagement.” Run a google search for “employee engagement,” and you’ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2e6467916ecca17476_WGUvQjc2cVbokj7ZWBthodtXomibzTSYpv469aHakXLoRuSgQG5Ld_ce7hypVIvetbPJP2yjqHbnGPg34FprykVqVSzHv1a0-fubL1WEfwoeEmlCX3Cq5YN8p79gqWfn5JTzThCz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote one definition: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employee engagement represents the levels of enthusiasm and connection employees have with their organization. It’s a measure of how motivated people are to put in extra effort for their organization, and a sign of how committed they are to staying there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the extensive clicking; here’s how the thinking goes for most of them: “Employee engagement&quot; leads to &quot;job satisfaction&quot; and &quot;employee happiness,&quot; and these then lead to “higher motivation and performance,” and eventually, “better results.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic assumption is that engaged employees deliver high-quality performance and this begs the question, how do we “engage” employees? The answer is spend a lot of money on frequent/big HR initiatives, sponsored group activities, celebrations to build camaraderie and make sure people have fun, and, for employees who are struggling, performance improvement plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed, as too often “employee engagement&quot; is treated like the end-game, rather than serving customers and getting results. For years, companies have been optimizing for what is – to some extent – a bad proxy, completely losing sight of the real target over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of management is not just about building loyalty, retention and career progression, and about implementing structures to ensure employee engagement and happiness. As obvious as it may sound, people don't need to be entertained at work to stay motivated, aligned or to really throw themselves into their work. The job of a great leader is not to entertain people, but to ensure that all team members are high performers who do amazing work and challenge one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual questions are: How can leaders motivate people? What’s the actual driver for individual motivations? And what actually encourages alignment and enables the best individual work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is clear and continuous communication about the &lt;strong&gt;context of the work to be done.&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means telling people: &quot;Here's exactly where we are and here's what we are trying to accomplish.&quot; Employees at all levels want and need to understand not only the particular work they're assigned, but also the larger story of the way the business works, the challenges the company faces and the competitive landscape. &lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need context to really do their best work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2ea5aec03af8d82c35_LzlklQMhFSpNXWGsHXrgks9T2LoytCwcIlHjLI8hERaeJ5ExPS24Rx8N5RFJGoyPnW-tIBv2XA7T_5HbnS8sAH8VU6XQwKuxs7GY3Kl7JcTxMRW_mojxABkLa1hhPd8N-NHSX4BT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more management time is spent on clearly communicating the context of the work to be done, the fewer the necessary policies, approvals, and incentives. On the other hand, the more an organization spends on planning employee engagement initiatives, the more this reveals about their fundamental internal flaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly understanding how the business works is the most valuable kind of learning – much more productive and appealing than &quot;employee development&quot; training – yet, this happens to be the most neglected area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2ea5aec09473d82c36_gkJjYgzaj0KwpAvyUkaLP-CQ5DmVPcZW5wT12CECwESDRGicPg_JerZMuvR_VLUwSCgv6zT8j63Vo6lOP8eueaQ4jpt1a39blgfqRL1ERUn-i2n9YzKZ5yYJDIfaCeGizNjbYLYB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2e7dad12524d53a2a3_8kaGAK_gMVduqLF7RyYeI5MpFAsZL0CGEQwf8wkNJehkwOdieCCrX2ZFjCGM7A65ehAYoSdDo7b9AfvQT-wMhY8CQoVD13lcbyHll0k4aYvh_Oo5zLHWrTXqmK_oiMBfCNrjukFl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t ask, “How can we keep employees engaged?” A much better question is,  “How can we create this context in which the work is to be done and make sure everyone is regularly exposed to it?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to create context about the work to be done? At its core, there are a handful of fundamental ingredients: the &lt;strong&gt;message&lt;/strong&gt; (what you are going to tell people), the &lt;strong&gt;firehose&lt;/strong&gt; (how you are going to distribute that message), and the &lt;strong&gt;rhythm&lt;/strong&gt; (how often you’re going to do it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the Message&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is the fundamental building block, and it’s not what you say, it’s what people understand. It’s what people read and actually comprehend. It’s the inner voice that over time people start to hear in the back of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5d8e0ab4183d1ecfdfa36c0e_blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://about:blank&quot;&gt;Understanding Media of Internal Communication&lt;/a&gt;, I described the difference between hot and cold messages. In hot messages, information is transmitted in high definition; the meaning of what’s being communicated is right in your face. Because there is no guesswork (the hard work has been done upfront by the presenter), they tend to be all-encompassing and require low participation. Conversely, in cold messages a lot is left unsaid, a lot of guesswork is required in order to read between the lines, and the reader has to fill in the gaps. They have low engagement, but high participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaningful context is built through hot messages: high-resolution information where nothing is left unsaid, the meaning is clear and the guesswork is reduced to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the initial premise: how one can go about deciding what needs to be communicated to create context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no single recipe for understanding what the content of your messages should be. One way to understand it is to identify the &lt;em&gt;knowledge gaps&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, to understand what matters most to you and your business and on what scale people are aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your content should focus both on the missing gaps and the reinforcement of what people already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good assessment of these gaps varies from organization to organization. As a rule of thumb, you can get an initial picture with these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. How well do you think people throughout the company could describe its business model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Do you share with your employees the same information presented in the earnings call? How frequently do you share your company P&amp;amp;L? Where are they likely to get data about how your company stacks up against the competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Is everyone aware of the difficult challenges your company faces? Have you asked them their thoughts about how to meet those challenges? Do you have a disciplined process for disseminating information and discussing challenges? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. What area of your business do you think your people know little to nothing about? Could you ask a leader in the domain to communicate with the team? Are there any other ways you could facilitate communication between the groups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. How well do you think your people understand who the customer is and what their needs and desires are? Do you regularly share customer research? Do you facilitate your team spending more time with your customers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. If you were going to hold an off-site, what is the most pressing issue you would want your people to learn about and debate? How could you provide the richest possible presentation of that information? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. What existing meetings or forums could be used to carve out dedicated time for communicating more about the business context? Do you regularly review any such meetings to be sure they are still effective? Do you regularly review and audit internal communication? Do you set different agendas for different kinds of communication (weekly stand-up vs. All-hands)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the Medium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified the information gaps and developed the storylines, you need a way to distribute the information. This is particularly important because the firehose (medium) you choose eventually molds the content and, depending on its shape, the nature of the information changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic assumption is: &lt;em&gt;cold media create spaces for cold messages&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and hot media create spaces for hot messages.&lt;/em&gt; In order to distribute high-resolution messages, you need to look for hot media. Specifically, you need to look for those which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Push the envelope of high-resolution information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common wisdom sees written text as the status quo for high-resolution messages. Whether an important email, a new piece of documentation, a protocol update, a leadership message or a simple chat message, everything goes through written words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written texts have the power to be read in any circumstance but they lack the ability to create an inner private world where you know people have your full attention. Audio messages on the other hand have the unique ability to recreate a personal environment: a private space, just for the two of you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mobile phones and the internet put anybody in the world in our pocket, and headphones then completed the distance, asynchronous audio messages become a more effective way to communicate in high definition. Audio can be used not only for content that touches important issues and requires more personal intimacy, but also for more ordinary issues that without the para-verbal components could be misinterpreted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the rise of streaming audio (music, podcasts, audiobooks, internet radio) has already made audio-first content a huge part of people’s daily habits. Having a way to distribute important messages through a direct voice to people’s heads is tremendous leverage, which today feels a bit underappreciated. Yet, very few organizations are capitalizing on this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2e13d30e4d0d8e6824_hfK35S8bvF_pdpEkWzvFKyYB_CzLPOQdgaoH99c3B9RqqpnT4-pny33u5x8Owee0BptLdKUb3eluCiUhcPQA-WYOrETNKhrr11cHvFqBMAERuauqadjYAjWMrKapYE3syhHlBOwM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking to distribute high-resolution content, look for media that can let you go the extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Privilege both speed and coverage of information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed is how fast a message is able to propagate throughout a system, and coverage is how many people that message is able to reach. You want to make sure people read your content in a timely manner (high speed), and at the same time, you want to make sure nobody is left behind (high coverage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time chat tools like Slack are designed to facilitate rapid information flow (high speed), but at the expense of a poor reach (low coverage). Email, on the other hand, acts in the exact opposite fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2ea5aec03e4fd82c37_ZbjPw2THe2UQ_vLoT2fD9xHWWtu5AkyyNl2oCgmjOgjixa7va_aFGn-Ycp4yMWigHwhHB1TbtIyJSBQwc0kogzDpSFntJB_REHP6iAVyCZ_9vWderTw85hMgxkWi7TUDO3Cij_Jf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When picking a medium, think carefully about the compromise (velocity vs coverage) you’re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Feature high signal/noise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attention and comprehension are where information “happens”. Avoid cluttered and overused media where information is already flowing in high-quantity. The chances of your message getting the right level of attention are very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Provide analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for products that have built-in analytics. While this might sound obvious, most of them don’t have mechanisms in place to let you understand how fast/slow your message has been read or (most importantly) by how many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2e6467919d8ea17478_svUjI2zC6XJT9H1AKBgbTJsB68T0Lrk1ZtBbXaeOEUQNh-QB9_lndlR7N-c03FPq6qFyr-7JiTFuMuPcx5-NJn23HklDfKX8jD-kdiVGBPtiauTJm13qqgSertngVS_gAcxO-vxW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, look for media that provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Data about how people engage with your message (skimming vs. deep-read)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Data about how fast they receive the message (low vs. fast distribution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Data about how many actually read your message (low vs. high coverage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Aggregated data over time about how the organization is consuming content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Aggregated data over time about how the organization is producing content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the Rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should bear in mind what type of content (messages) you need to talk about and how it’s going to be distributed (the medium).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc2f7dad1267fa53a2a4_bhbyi63wRmgxWzJTXj3xFQtmgWKJoTgSzpTXuPnF9-kmM_rlOduSeWxHE_73-laSWTD5GujXCQgG1IqMqZUl3PZEg_9_o5sZYquE92KNKCMfk52fLz_a4iKR7RyKodh7LDXGzE8h.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two aren’t enough if you don’t develop what I call a strong &lt;strong&gt;heartbeat of communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Working out how to do this — and, for company leaders and HR executives, coaching all managers to do it consistently and continuously, takes a lot of time. Finding an organization pace, not only means finding a rhythm regarding  the creation/distribution of information, but also letting people create personal habits of information consumption over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a strong heartbeat of communication starts with these two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You need an owner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner establishes the pace and oversees its execution, making sure the entire company is following it regularly. Depending on the company size and its culture, this role may change considerably. In some organizations, the CEO directly handles important communication. In others, there’s a head of internal communication or Chief of Staff who acts as air traffic control for high-resolution communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Find Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From sales and customer service to product and engineering teams, each department should have a DRI responsible for delivering updates, keeping not just their own people, but the entire company up-to-date on what’s going on in their team, as well as broader issues that everyone should be aware of. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhythm is such an essential detail because as both business and the context of the work to be done to keep changing, so should the messages. Pulling the same messages and showing them over and over is not effective. You’ve got to constantly monitor the messages and update them as soon as the circumstances change. A strong heartbeat ensures that the organization is always informed by the latest and most important information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure, measure, measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you ensure things are constantly improving over time? You need a systematic way to measure what’s happening. That’s where you close the feedback loop. While it may sound obvious in retrospect, not many businesses are measuring how they’re communicating and how well their approach is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what’s working and what’s not working, you need to get both:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;em&gt;Qualitative feedback&lt;/em&gt;: collect employee memos to precisely understand how things could be improved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;em&gt;Quantitative feedback&lt;/em&gt;: measure data on how people interact with your messages; how many of them actually read it, how relevant the information is, how often do they check it etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Positive Feedback Loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you execute the above steps correctly you end up creating a positive feedback loop where the more you communicate, the better context you deliver to your team and the more people actually understand their impact and feel emotionally attached to the company and its mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loops are powerful because they aren’t one-shot initiatives, they compound over time, eventually turning your strengths into an actual competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d82a99beb8133c2f04fa42c/5dcebc30792b96df5fb7737c_o1qTowt0PJh9REMBUOmKlWBFeFmZXsaYl438lQnPnxbzcfXf0HmvT8-bixGTizev1Ib1g69dELgzwLz-ZYT9IBFBSbpG9U6g6S7gZKkcGjywTJCkw3rDYkkkbgt-2gpyoaXT1sJZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly empowering people to learn how your business works and what the broader context of their contributions is makes for the most valuable learning and the most effective form of “employee engagement”. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not big HR initiatives or sponsored group activities, but simple, clear, continuous communication about the context of the work to be done is the first step in creating a high-output organization and retaining your best talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cops are making fewer arrests since N.J. got rid of cash bail</title>
<link>https://www.nj.com/data/2019/11/cops-are-making-fewer-arrests-since-nj-got-rid-of-cash-bail.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nj.com/data/2019/11/cops-are-making-fewer-arrests-since-nj-got-rid-of-cash-bail.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;DAI6IIL4XBGI5B2LS75W2MPHBA&quot;&gt;New Jersey’s history-making and controversial move away from a cash bail system was expected to lead to fewer people sitting behind bars because they couldn’t afford to pay their way out while awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;BE2TSZCG5BD5FPSDEXN2LM5ITU&quot;&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdrc.org/publication/evaluation-pretrial-justice-system-reforms-use-public-safety-assessment-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a new study released&lt;/a&gt; Thursday shows the overhaul led to a major shift in the state’s justice system, with fewer people being arrested for low-level crimes, jail populations that plummeted even more than expected and an increase in defendants set free without conditions such as ankle-bracelet monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;MNFGMPKM6BG4FJN5TMNSHIVTMM&quot;&gt;At the same time, state and federal data show a continued decline in crime in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;HKF6TSURK5CQ3G6XIPPQKVQJDA&quot;&gt;The findings come as court systems around the country consider similar reforms, part of a national movement away from cash bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;EDAQ7JUKSFCQ5FLB4CQJN3KPZM&quot;&gt;“Many jurisdictions are not going this far,” said Cindy Redcross, one of the lead authors of the study, which was funded by Arnold Ventures, the creator of the risk-assessment tool New Jersey courts use instead of relying on cash bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;QP3SGH3LM5DU5PQ7NTU33W26LQ&quot;&gt;“They’re making small tweaks because they’re afraid of what could happen if they eliminate bail,” said Redcross, the director of the MDRC Center for Criminal Justice Research. “So it’s important that Jersey is doing it and the world hasn’t stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;DSRNR7H3ORACDJIL6B5P2DAMA4&quot;&gt;As New York prepares for its own bail overhaul, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/05/trump-de-blasio-on-ny-bail-reform/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;law enforcement leaders have expressed grave concerns&lt;/a&gt; about public safety and even President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1191718159583240192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1191718159583240192&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewyork.cbslocal.com%2F2019%2F11%2F05%2Ftrump-de-blasio-on-ny-bail-reform%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weighed in&lt;/a&gt;, tweeting that Democratic leaders in the state were “letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened &amp;amp; bad, onto the sidewalks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;5HIZ5G5ALFHIZA2KDVU56CWTPQ&quot;&gt;New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, fired back that the New York law, which takes effect in January, is “essentially the same bail reform law New Jersey passed several years ago under Republican Governor Chris Christie,” Trump’s longtime friend and ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;2GOZB2LTJBENZDUXNNZDABCOBY&quot;&gt;The political animus mimics what New Jersey saw in the early days of bail reform, with state leaders praising the overhaul and local law enforcement expressing concern about who was being let out until trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;VXLEORSOB5CIRI7U5DBWLPRMFQ&quot;&gt;Among the fiercest critics in its first few months were local elected officials in the state’s urban centers, including Newark and Jersey City, where mayors decried the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nj.com/hudson/2017/04/bill_reform_plan_pits_lawmakers_against_civil_libe.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defendants facing gun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nj.com/essex/2018/02/murder_suspect_was_released_twice_on_domestic_viol.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;domestic violence charges&lt;/a&gt;, leading to new guidance for prosecutors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nj.com/politics/2017/02/nj_bail_reform_opponents_lose_first_challenge_to_s.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;County governments also complained&lt;/a&gt; of the financial burdens they faced funding the overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;XXBSB5YGINCOZBQVGCR65BXVTY&quot;&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/04/njs-bail-reform-did-not-cause-a-spike-in-crime-report-says-but-the-program-is-going-broke.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another report from the state judiciary earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; found lingering racial disparities in the state’s jails, noting that “an overrepresentation of black males in the pretrial jail population remains an area in need of further examination by New Jersey’s criminal justice system as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;BEQZPWZVX5G5TN2Q6MBG62L4OA&quot;&gt;That report also found slight increases in the rate of people charged with new crimes while awaiting trial and the rate of people who failed to show up for court dates, but noted they coincided with an overall decline in New Jersey’s crime rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;736DWAQGL5GTFIEJ7GE4G3C4VM&quot;&gt;MDRC, a nonpartisan research group, said it will further study the reforms’ effects on defendants by race, how often they show up for court and what the outcomes of their cases are, among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;YY3FIECM7BGSPPI2QUQZLUGIN4&quot;&gt;Under the old system, a judge would look at the charges against a defendant as well as their record and set bail. Now, judges weigh whether to lock somebody up, slap an ankle bracelet on them or release them without conditions with the help of a public safety assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;4XABGVQ265HTTJEF7R2BMPROTM&quot;&gt;The assessment was created by Arnold Ventures, which funded the MDRC study. The group told NJ Advance Media it analyzed data provided by the state judiciary and provided the news organization with the underlying figures but declined to share the code it used for its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;WU7AJ4JHMNBQHEUZZ22BX5C3QA&quot;&gt;Such algorithms are increasingly being used across the country as to inform a judge’s decision. Proponents say they level the playing field by giving judges an objective analysis of a defendant’s record. But they have also met criticism that they perpetuate racial bias in the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;RHZPFDRG2NETTNOT6FP5ITWB4M&quot;&gt;Proponents of New Jersey’s system note that unlike similar tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that have drawn scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; in other states, the PSA’s “risk factors” and formulas are made public, and judges still have final say over whether to follow the assessment’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;VI6HXVMM2NF2ZDXETR2HE427SU&quot;&gt;“No assessment will ever be able to correct for the biases of the policing system and the biases of the data coming out of the criminal justice system,” said James Cadogan, Arnold Ventures’ vice president for criminal justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;ADZETKSL3REPLMQM4UKJUV33JE&quot;&gt;“What we have in the (assessment) is a way to take the same data a judge would see in a court docket and ensure consistency case-to-case in how that data is being used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;VR5AS7AVY5FXVD662LJ7T6OTHM&quot;&gt;Alexander Shalom, a senior attorney at the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said his group has its own concerns about using algorithms to guide criminal justice decisions. But he also argued that the new system is a vast improvement over a bail-based one that disproportionately hurt poor defendants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;COFSEV6D5NHIPJEZOLINVRVYS4&quot;&gt;“The system we replaced here was an unmitigated civil rights disaster,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;ETZYWH7KDVCW7EBISQOEMJ4KCM&quot;&gt;“If we saw that they resulted in some bias in the outcomes, that would be a concern,&quot; said Joseph Krakora, the state’s top public defender. “That’s really the test of a risk assessment tool: Is it actually predictive? And so far, it looks like it is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;6PTAJXGRXVE77B54TA6F6ARAHU&quot;&gt;The assessment gets used at two points in New Jersey’s justice system: when a police officer is deciding whether to arrest someone on a complaint warrant or simply issue a summons for the person to show up in court, and when prosecutors and judges consider whether defendants should be locked up until trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;PF2NZ2MYAFH5FAPHV4JSHRKV4Y&quot;&gt;The new report shows that New Jersey police officers and prosecutors significantly changed tactics in response to the overhaul, relying on summonses far more often than they had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;LUABYCNDBRB2TGQTNE7GDPTBIA&quot;&gt;The report notes that this decline was focused on the least serious charges, including loitering or obscenity, rather than violent crimes and other indictable offenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;HMSPYVU655FA7DURWS2TSIH4S4&quot;&gt;Redcross, one of the study’s authors, said there’s no definitive reason for this decline, but it could be attributed to greater oversight of police by prosecutors and the courts, changes in paperwork requirements resulting from the reforms or even a culture change that resulted from New Jersey doing away with cash bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;H2UE2RWHKJHG5ENTNRHWWHPUVE&quot;&gt;The report notes that it’s “possible that other policy changes,” such as the Newark Police Department’s move away from stop-and-frisk policing tactics, could also have contributed, but that its analysis of historical data strongly suggested bail reform played a major role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;TMLDM6TIDVH7XI23L4L52MGYNY&quot;&gt;Under the new system, defendants are supposed to get their first hearing within 48 hours, and the report found that the state’s courts were meeting this requirement, with the average hearing happening with an average of 29 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;ZBQ7LCFJA5H5POUPXJ5QN2OQWQ&quot;&gt;But the courts are falling short on another aim of the reforms, which calls for a detention hearing – a crucial court appearance where defendants learn whether they’ll be locked up until trial ­– within three business days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;NKISXAXW7FFLJD4JCDD3BPQKOQ&quot;&gt;The report found those hearings “commonly occur about a week” after the first appearance. The researchers attributed this to “brief adjournments” granted to defense attorneys and prosecutors, often to review evidence in the case, which are permitted under the new law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;KC3GD2OLFFH7HM2ZJWFRN3VLYY&quot;&gt;Shalom, the ACLU attorney, said speedy trial issues are the likely “next wave of litigation,” as prosecutors and defense attorneys duel over the new court rules still taking shape more than two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__paragraph--left&quot; id=&quot;2Q342NSUMNBAHMIOK6ZDFUZXZQ&quot;&gt;“Anyone who looks at what we’ve done in New Jersey and says, ‘Aha, we’ve achieved perfection!’ is nonsensical,” Shalom said. “But we can’t just look at what we’ve got, we’ve got to look at from whence we came.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sourcehut&amp;#039;s Year in Alpha</title>
<link>https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-11-15-sourcehut-1-year-alpha/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-11-15-sourcehut-1-year-alpha/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the commencement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/2018/11/15/sr.ht-general-availability.html&quot;&gt;Sourcehut’s public alpha&lt;/a&gt;, after 2 years in private development. I’m immensely thankful for your support during the alpha. It’s mostly been a one-man operation here, but thanks in large part to the financial support of the alpha users, I’ve been able to work on Sourcehut and free software in general full-time for a full year as of this February. With this first year of the alpha behind us, what have we accomplished, and what do we have planned for 2020?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just looking for November’s status update? &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-11-15-sourcehut-1-year-alpha/#status-update&quot;&gt;It’s at the bottom, this a-way… ↓&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2019-in-summary&quot;&gt;2019 in summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really proud of what we accomplished in 2019. Here are some of my personal favorite highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployment of APIs and webhooks throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing comprehensive systems monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Became profitable and self-sustaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bringing on our first staff member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial development of web-based code review within our design framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maturation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://todo.sr.ht&quot;&gt;todo.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; into a great ticket tracking system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/2019/07/08/Announcing-annotations-for-sourcehut.html&quot;&gt;Code annotations&lt;/a&gt; added for &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht&quot;&gt;git.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://builds.sr.ht&quot;&gt;builds.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; VMs for debugging and hacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability of Alpine, Arch, and Debian repositories for third-party sr.ht deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to read plans for 2020? &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-11-15-sourcehut-1-year-alpha/#expectations-for-2020&quot;&gt;Skip the pretty pictures →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/thL-.png&quot; alt=&quot;SSH access to build VMs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;SSH access to a failed builds.sr.ht job&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/w767.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code annotations on git.sr.ht&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Browsing an annotated codebase on git.sr.ht&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Your web browser does not support the webm video codec. Please consider using web browsers that support free and open standards.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Preparing patchsets to be emailed with git.sr.ht&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/sjtE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code review thread parsing on lists.sr.ht&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Reviewing a patchset on the web with lists.sr.ht&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;expectations-for-2020&quot;&gt;Expectations for 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Sourcehut will enter the beta phase in 2020, and be approaching the production phase by the end of the year. Some features I’m looking forward to are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User groups/organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A centralized project hub, bringing together our disparate services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data ownership and portability for all services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed web-based patch submission/review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maturation of hg.sr.ht into a competitive Hg hosting service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with more projects throughout the software project hosting ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fruits of financially supporting free software developers — exactly what comes of this is unknown, but I’m excited as hell about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From developers sponsored by Sourcehut going into 2020, I’m expecting to see more developments in Wayland and Linux graphics, mail clients &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; servers, improvements to Alpine Linux, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrsh.sh&quot;&gt;mrsh&lt;/a&gt;’s completion and initial release, miscellaneous patches to any free software project which crosses our path, and new projects which I expect will pleasantly surprise us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone for your support in our first year, and I’m looking forward to continuing to serve you into the next. &lt;img src=&quot;https://sourcehut.org/party.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly we’re going to accomplish these goals is a subject worthy of some attention, too. I frequently get questions about the stability of the alpha, when the beta will come and how things will change, and so on. So, I’ve taken this opportunity to write down The Master Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-roadmap&quot;&gt;Development roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, briefly, the plan for Sourcehut’s development lifecycle has been roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build several standalone services which each solve a problem for software projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop APIs and webhooks for each of these services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach them how to talk to each other, creating a complete system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve mostly completed phases 1 and 2 and development on phase 3 is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base development of git.sr.ht, builds.sr.ht, lists.sr.ht, man.sr.ht, and more. This is close to complete, insofar as all of the unknowns are known. Some services are missing a few features which arguably fit into this step, such as git blame support for git.sr.ht, but for the most part everything is complete in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phase is the introduction of APIs and webhooks for every service, which is a necessary step before integrating everything together. The APIs and webhooks each service will use (and now, do use) to talk to each other are no different than those offered to end-users, which helps to prove the API design is flexible enough to support a broad variety of use-cases and integrations with other parts of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phase is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; complete — see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.sr.ht/#service-documentation&quot;&gt;API documentation links here&lt;/a&gt; for an idea of which services have API coverage. The main exceptions are man.sr.ht and dispatch.sr.ht, which don’t have an API because they’re low-priority targets for integration with other services; and hg.sr.ht, which technically has an API that is mostly compatible with git.sr.ht’s API but is left undocumented for want of an Hg specific API design document from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building out these APIs also informed a lot of design decisions which helped to move the codebases from “experimental” into “maintainable”. In phase one, we establish the scope for each project and prove that its ideas are feasible, and in stage two we refined the prototypes into production-worthy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final phase of development is perhaps the most exciting phase, as it’s in this step that we get to deliver on many of the usability promises of Sourcehut. Some early progress has already been made in this direction. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teaching git.sr.ht &amp;amp; hg.sr.ht to push CI jobs to builds.sr.ht&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhauling man.sr.ht to replace its internal git repos with git.sr.ht repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching git.sr.ht to prepare and send patchsets to mailing lists, e.g. lists.sr.ht&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future plans include tasks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach lists.sr.ht how to submit CI jobs to validate incoming patchsets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach lists.sr.ht how to merge patches to git/hg repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor todo to use lists in a similar way to man’s use of git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advantage of this three-stage approach is that each of these phase three features can, in theory, be extended to include other parts of the ecosystem. lists.sr.ht can be re-purposed to manage patches and code review for a Gitlab repository, builds.sr.ht can be used to run CI for GitHub repositories, git.sr.ht can be used to send patches to the Linux kernel, and so on. This is part of our commitment to embrace existing communities rather than building a new walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;operations-roadmap&quot;&gt;Operations roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a software project, Sourcehut offers a hosted service at sr.ht. The administration of this hosted service is another factor which requires planning and plays into the stability of the service. There are three major concerns of the operations roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; is the steps we take to ensure your account and its data is safe from malicious actors. This includes careful access controls - ensuring each system has access to only the data it needs; establishing trust levels and securing each system accordingly - for example, the multiple layers of isolation used for CI jobs on builds.sr.ht; and other miscellaneous concerns like secure SSH configuration, SSL maintenance, network administration, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data integrity&lt;/strong&gt; was important to address early in the alpha period, and has been essentially completed. For all persistent data, extreme pains are taken to ensure that it remains consistent even in emergencies - and our systems to ensure this have been battle tested &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; emergencies, including disk failures on critical machines. Our multiple layers of redundancy for data preservation were &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/2019/01/13/Backups-and-redundancy-at-sr.ht.html&quot;&gt;laid out in detail&lt;/a&gt; in January and have only been improved since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt; is concerned with making sure that our services are always online, and during the alpha is a secondary concern. Our long-term goal is to approach zero downtime, by setting up load balancers and tiered deployments. Our software is designed with this in mind, which will ease the eventual deployment of high availability services. However, today we still have planned outages, and each deployment costs between 10 and 60 seconds of outage for the affected services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; is a cross-cutting task which is essential to the success of the other goals. Setting up systems to observe and characterize the behavior of our services informs the planning and execution of security, data integrity, and availability goals. For example, we use monitoring to watch for suspicious activity, ensure our backups are up-to-date, and understand our system’s load to prevent outages. This is mostly complete but alarming is due for an overhaul - Grafana alarms aren’t great for serving all of our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operations matter that was settled early and no longer factors into our planning is the release and deployment process for Sourcehut services. An acceptance requirement of builds.sr.ht’s initial deployment was that it be self-hosted and self-deploying &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; support the deployment of *.sr.ht as well, and as such this goal was met before even the public alpha began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;business-roadmap&quot;&gt;Business roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health of Sourcehut as a business is also my responsibility. Providing the hosted service is not free, and getting myself paid enough to keep food on the table is important for the development and health of the project as a whole. This basically involves lots of spreadsheets, tracking the income and expenses of the business, and making projections for the future. The monitoring system maintained by the operations work is also put to use for BI (business intelligence) reporting and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically maintain three projections: pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic. A rough approximation of how these are done is: pessimistic projections assume that no one signs up for new subscriptions, monthly subscriptions continue paying out, and yearly subscriptions don’t. Realistic projections amortize yearly subscriptions over a year, assume no one cancels, but also assumes no growth. Optimistic projections expect the current rates of growth to continue. Most of our long-term planning is based on the pessimistic projections. These models are going to be updated soon as we start to get data on how many users cancel their subscription when the first yearly renewals come up this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work also involves dealing with taxes, regulatory compliance, making sure contractors are paid on time, and so on. Boring stuff, but it eats up a lot of time. Additionally, marketing falls under this umbrella, which mainly takes the form of posts on this blog and showing up when people talk about us online to answer questions. I’ve tried asking happy users to blog about their experiences, but most people don’t have a blog or are shy about writing, so there’s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog&quot;&gt;yak shaving to be done first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main business goal at first was profitability, which has been achieved. Additional goals are to generate a revenue stream which can continue to support investment in new hardware, sponsoring free accounts for less fortunate users, marketing and outreach efforts, and sponsoring free software developers to work on self-directed projects. All of these goals are proceeding nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stability-roadmap&quot;&gt;Stability roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these development phases play into the external stability presented by the service? Thus far, all of this development has been considered “alpha”. There are two additional phases: beta and production. The scope and completion criteria of each phase in the stability roadmap is informed by the progress in each other roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, some of the development tasks blocking the graduation from alpha to beta include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User groups (for organizations managing many accounts or projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely web-driven patchset submission and code review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A centralized, indexed project hub which allows you to link a project’s git/hg repos, bug trackers, mailing lists, and so on under a single top-level “project”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data ownership, i.e. self-service data import and export tools for all services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In operations, an overhauled alarming system is a blocker for the beta, and high availability is a blocker for production. Confidence in our data integrity and security systems is a beta requirement, and has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the business side, a beta task was to achieve sustainability - that is, to make a profit - which was achieved in Q1 2019. A business which is losing money cannot be considered stable, after all. An outstanding business task which still holds up the beta is establishing the final pricing model for the beta and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! What a long article. Thanks to everyone for helping out during the alpha, I really appreciate your support. Since the last update, we have another 825 users to welcome to the platform, bringing our grand total up to 11,364. 1,320 of you have chosen to pay for your alpha account, which I am deeply grateful for. Thank you, everyone! Let’s get to the updates for this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-updates&quot;&gt;General updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Eli Schwartz’s help, the Arch Linux package repo saw some improvements this month, and Luca Weiss pitched in to fix some outdated database migration scripts. Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-sr-ht&quot;&gt;git.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on performance improvements for git over SSH again. An earlier attempt was an abject failure - I had moved some logic into the web app and accessed it over an internal API, under the rationale that the web app had already spent the Python VM and SQLAlchemy setup time. In fact what really happened is that git operations - which happen all the time - started to pin the web workers, because Python can’t into async. The result is that the entire stack slowed down dramatically. I rolled a nat’ 1 on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new solution is way, way better. I rewrote two pieces of the pipeline in Go and overhauled the SQL queries, and now the time-to-/usr/bin/git is significantly reduced, often less than a second. Prior to the disastrous change, it could be as much as 10 seconds, and post disastrous change it was as much as 45, with the web app being slowed to a similar crawl. With this approach, git operations are fast and the web app is buttery smooth. The last piece to improve on is the post-update hook. You’ll notice the slowness there, since git will quickly show its push output, then stop again while we run the post-update. I hope to improve this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the git-over-SSH performance has been disappointing for a while, and I’m sorry. The pipeline here is a complex machine with lots of moving parts, and all of them are slow. A comprehensive solution requires a lot of overhauling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party contributions to git.sr.ht have also been coming in recently, with Ian Moody making improvements to the diff view (for hg.sr.ht, too), and Honza Porkorny switching our tree views to a monospaced font. I’ve also made a number of bug fixes to the new patchset preparation UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;todo-sr-ht&quot;&gt;todo.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve implemented half of the necessary steps for todo.sr.ht to meet its data ownership goals, by implementing a data export tool. There is some interesting novelty here that merits some attention. The export prepares a gzipped JSON dump of all of your tracker’s tickets and events, and is more or less just a shortcut to the API. However, certain information - usernames, comment text, and such - are signed with SourceHut’s webhook signing key. The idea is that if you re-import these dumps later, we can verify that anything our users have said on the tracker has not been tampered with, and confidently show their username next to their comments. Additionally, third-party Sourcehut instances which trust our word upstream can check these signatures against our key and be confident that those are authentic comments authored by Sourcehut users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this will only be useful when the data import side of this work is completed, which is still to come. In other news, Ivan Habunek has written a UI for editing labels, and added URL parameters for auto-filling the title and description for new tickets, which is useful, for example, to provide links to file tickets pre-populated with stack traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dispatch-sr-ht&quot;&gt;dispatch.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dispatch.sr.ht can now build GitLab commits! I wanted to add merge requests as well, but it’s blocked by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/16491&quot;&gt;this GitLab bug&lt;/a&gt;. If/when this issue is addressed, running builds.sr.ht CI for GitLab merge requests will be possible as well. This is currently available for gitlab.com and gitlab.freedesktop.org - if you want me to set it up for your GitLab instance, please send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just some small updates: I have added URLs for obtaining a user’s SSH and PGP public keys. Just visit meta.sr.ht/~username.keys or ~username.pgp. There have also been some improvements to the billing pages, which is especially important as the first yearly payments will start renewing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;paste-sr-ht&quot;&gt;paste.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mykyta Holubakha’s hard work, pastes on paste.sr.ht can now be deleted! This was non-trivial because we de-duplicate paste contents in the database. Thanks Mykyta! We’re hoping to see support for editing pastes coming soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;builds-sr-ht&quot;&gt;builds.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some mundane image updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;freebsd/12.x builds are now using FreeBSD 12.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora images have been improved and updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NixOS images have been improved and updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, OpenBSD 6.6 support is right around the corner. Thanks to our hardworking build image maintainers for keeping up with these releases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;names-sr-ht&quot;&gt;names.sr.ht&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress has been made since this was teased in October. That’s all I’ve got to say :)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Meetings at work should be seen as a form of &quot;therapy&quot; rather than about decision-making, say researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academics from the University of Malmo in Sweden say meetings provide an outlet for people at work to show off their status or to express frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Patrik Hall says they are becoming increasingly frequent - as more managerial and &quot;strategy&quot; jobs generate more meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he says despite there being more meetings &quot;few decisions are made&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hall has investigated an apparent contradiction in how people can have a low opinion of work meetings, yet their numbers keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Looking for a purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political scientist says the rise in meetings reflects changes in the workforce - with fewer people doing and making things and an increase in those involved in &quot;meetings-intense&quot; roles such as strategists, advisers, consultants and managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People don't do concrete things any more,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead he says there has been a rise of managerial roles, which are often not very well defined, and where &quot;the hierarchy is not that clear&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45333270&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Emails while commuting should count as work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many managers don't know what to do,&quot; he says, and when they are &quot;unsure of their role&quot;, they respond by generating more meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People like to talk and it helps them find a role,&quot; says the professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these people can spend half of their working hours in meetings, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Managers uncertain about their purpose will generate more meetings

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can spill over into pre- and post-meetings, to such an extent that people might begin to &quot;disguise&quot; how much time they spend attending them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hall, who has co-authored a book on meetings, gives the example of the Swedish border police, who describe their overseas meetings as &quot;power weeks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Opportunity to complain'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meetings can &quot;arouse feelings of meaninglessness&quot;, he says. But he argues that is often missing their point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in a meeting - particularly long ones - their function can become &quot;almost therapeutic&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Meetings - a chance to catch up on messages on the mobile
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what they are meant to be discussing, they serve a purpose as an &quot;opportunity to complain and be acknowledged by colleagues&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people going to many meetings can lose patience - and can spend much of the time playing with their mobile phones, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hall says as a result, meetings can become &quot;maligned somewhat unnecessarily&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people find this frustrating and question why they must endure them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he argues that negativity towards meetings can be because their real purposes are misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many regular, internal meetings might seem entirely &quot;pointless&quot; to those taking part, says Prof Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he says the real purpose of such meetings might be to assert the authority of an organisation, so that employees are reminded that they are part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such meetings are not really about making any decisions, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Power struggle'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Hall suggests booking rooms for shorter periods, as he says meetings will expand to fill whatever time is given to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also says that &quot;equality&quot; of participants is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you have meetings with colleagues at the same level, as a professional, you get to discuss different issues that interest you,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the meetings are dominated by different levels of status, they become a &quot;power struggle&quot; and leave participants feeling frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also says that meetings can unfairly become the focus of other dissatisfactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People often feel marginalised. They feel that they have no influence or position. In these cases, the perception is that meetings do not improve anything, but actually cause even more frustration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Which answer in this list is the correct answer to this question? (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn't appear to me that the yet very interesting point brought up by RCT, nor the original post supply a reason for excluding answer number 2. In fact, the original point that it would not deny 1, does not mean it affirms it, still, and therefore, if #3 to #6 are false, #2 is valid. Until we confute #2, we cannot call 5 true either, samewise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think an interesting argumentation - while irrelevant after the preceeding answers - is that the answer has to be a not-self-excluding answer (i.e: not #1, #3, #4). In fact, if the answer were to be #4, for instance, it would define the answer to be not #4, excluding the possibility that #4 is indeed the answer (a contradiction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and RCT point leave us with #2 and #5 again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer 4 (&quot;One of the above&quot;) would be true if 2 (&quot;None of the below&quot;) were, but 2 contradicts 4, therefore 2 cannot be true and 5 is the only possible answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same answer, it just appeared to me that I may have missed to see a valid proof in previous statements, but I may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;7f4b&quot; class=&quot;kt je eu at me b fw mi mj mk ml mm mg r mh&quot;&gt;Excerpt, &lt;em class=&quot;iv&quot;&gt;The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann&lt;/em&gt; by Herman Goldstein (1980)&lt;/span&gt;

Teller, after a lifetime of successful controversy, is emotional, extroverted and not one to hide his candle. Szilard was passionate, oblique, engagé, and infuriating. Johnny [...] was none of these.

&lt;p id=&quot;0176&quot; class=&quot;ht hu eu at hv b hw iq hy ir ia is ic it ie iu hp&quot;&gt;By the time von Neumann enrolled in university in 1921, he had already written a paper with one of his tutors, Mikhail Fekete on “A generalization of Fejér’s theorem on the location of the roots of a certain kind of polynomial” (Ulam, 1958). Fekete had along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_R%C3%A1tz&quot; class=&quot;dc by iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Laszló Rátz&lt;/a&gt; reportedly taken a notice to von Neumann and begun tutoring him in university-level mathematics. According to Ulam, even at age of 18, von Neumann was already recognized as a full-fledged mathematician.

I don't maintain that I understood anything, but enough to see that this was an outstanding work, and to recognize ex ungue leonem [the claws of the lion]. While answering in this sense, I invited the young scholar to visit me in Marburg, and discussed things with him, strongly advising him to prepare the ground for the understanding of so technical an essay by a more informal essay which could stress the new access to the problem and its fundamental consequences. He wrote such an essay under the title Eine Axiomatisierung der Mengerlehre and I published it in 1925.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;f6f5&quot; class=&quot;ht hu eu at hv b hw jr hy js ia jt ic ju ie jv hp&quot;&gt;As Macrae (1992) writes, there was never much doubt that Johnny would one day be attending university. Johnny’s father, Max, initially wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a well-paid financier, worrying about the financial stability of a career in mathematics. However, with the help of the encouragement from Hungarian mathematicians such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip%C3%B3t_Fej%C3%A9r&quot; class=&quot;dc by iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Lipót Fajér&lt;/a&gt; and Rudolf Ortvay, his father eventually acquiesced and decided to let von Neumann pursue his passions, financing his studies abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;293c&quot; class=&quot;ht hu eu at hv b hw iq hy ir ia is ic it ie iu hp&quot;&gt;Johnny, apparently in agreement with his father, decided initially to pursue a career in chemical engineering. As he didn’t have any knowledge of chemistry, it was arranged that he could take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin. He did, from 1921 to 1923, afterwards sitting for and passing the entrance exam to the prestigious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ethh+zurich&amp;amp;oq=ethh+zurich&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2514j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; class=&quot;dc by iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt;. Still interested in pursuing mathematics, he also simultaneously entered University Pázmány Péter (now Eötvös Loránd University) in Budapest as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. His Ph.D. thesis, officially written under the supervision of Fajér, regarded the axiomatization of &lt;a class=&quot;dc by iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-nature-of-infinity-and-beyond-a05c146df02c&quot;&gt;Cantor’s set theory&lt;/a&gt;. As he was officially in Berlin studying chemistry, he completed his Ph.D. largely &lt;em class=&quot;iv&quot;&gt;in absentia&lt;/em&gt;, only appearing at the University in Budapest at the end of each term for exams. While in Berlin, he collaborated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Schmidt&quot; class=&quot;dc by iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Erhard Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; on set theory and also attended courses in physics, including statistical mechanics taught by Albert Einstein. At ETH, starting in 1923, he continued both his studies in chemistry and his research in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

By the time he arrived in Göttingen, von Neumann was already well acquainted with the topic, in addition to his Ph.D. dissertation having already published two related papers on the topic while at ETH.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sea-Thru: A Method for Removing Water from Underwater Images</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;fluid-iframe&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExOOElyZ2Hk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer has developed a computer program that can, in her words, “remove the water” from an underwater photograph. The result is a “physically accurate” image with all of the vibrance, saturation and color of a regular landscape photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology, &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Akkaynak_Sea-Thru_A_Method_for_Removing_Water_From_Underwater_Images_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;called Sea-thru&lt;/a&gt;, was developed by oceanographer and engineer Derya Akkaynak while she was a post-doctoral fellow under Tali Treibitz at the University of Haifa, and it has the potential to revolutionize underwater photography. While “remove the water” isn’t the most scientific explanation for how the technology works, as you can see in the Scientific American feature above, that’s more or less what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By automatically removing the color cast and backscatter caused by the way light moves through a body of water, she’s able to capture underwater landscapes as they would look to the human eye on dry land—in other words: if all the water were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akkaynak and Haifa created Sea-thru by capturing “more than 1,100 images from two optically different water bodies,” each of which include her color chart. These photos were then used to train a model that compensated for the way light is both scattered and absorbed by water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every time I see a reef with large 3D structures, I place my color chart at the base of the reef, and I swim away about 15 meters,” explains Akkaynak. “Then I start swimming towards the reef, towards the color chart, and photograph it from slightly different angles until I get to the reef.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the color chart is no longer necessary. As Akkaynak helpfully explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/dvts2j/this_researcher_created_an_algorithm_that_removes/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, “All you need is multiple images of the scene under natural light, no color chart necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample image, published alongside &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Akkaynak_Sea-Thru_A_Method_for_Removing_Water_From_Underwater_Images_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the research paper&lt;/a&gt; explaining this technique in detail, shows you just how incredible Sea-thru really is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/The-Sea-thru-method-removes-water-from-underwater-images-Best-viewed-online-for-color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;1135&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-392248&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/The-Sea-thru-method-removes-water-from-underwater-images-Best-viewed-online-for-color.jpg 850w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/The-Sea-thru-method-removes-water-from-underwater-images-Best-viewed-online-for-color-240x320.jpg 240w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/The-Sea-thru-method-removes-water-from-underwater-images-Best-viewed-online-for-color-599x800.jpg 599w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this method is not the same as Photoshopping an image to add in contrast and artificially enhance the colors that are absorbed most quickly by the water. It’s a “physically accurate correction,” and the results truly speak for themselves. And while this technology was developed with an eye towards scientific uses, we can only imagine the results it would produce if shared with incredible &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; photographers like Paul Nicklen…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the algorithm in action and learn more about how Akkaynak was able to achieve this, watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sea-thru-brings-clarity-to-underwater-photos1/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feature up top. And if you want to dive into the nitty gritty of how this algorithm was developed and how it works, you can read the full research paper on Sea-thru &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Akkaynak_Sea-Thru_A_Method_for_Removing_Water_From_Underwater_Images_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
