&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuwpogye001c3h63ss49kpkn@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;50&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics researchers reached this conclusion by comparing regular survey data to diary data from the American Time Use Survey, a Census project that asks Americans to track, diary style, how their weekly time is divided among 163 different activity categories, from sleeping to shopping to pet care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/cjuwpm2ne00s6say63gjmlafe@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-480&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/Intelligencer_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250,300x252,320x100&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-zoLfRVTu&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/cjuwpm2ne00s8say6jq5f5toi@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-480-768&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/Intelligencer_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;468x60,480x60,300x250&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-Sc7b4EPm&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuwpvwbh001j3h63s95oy9rf@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;152&quot;&gt;The ATUS data has a couple of advantages over simpler survey data where you just ask people how many hours a week they typically spend working for pay, or taking care of the house, or attending church. One is that people are bad at estimating: When you give people a long list of activity categories and ask them how many hours a week they spend on each, they tend to give an answer that sums to more than 168 hours. The ATUS diary structure has the advantage of limiting respondents to 24 hours of time when reporting a day’s activity. Another issue is that questions about one specific activity are more subject to social desirability bias: If you ask people to tell you everything they did on Sunday, rather than asking specifically how much time they spent at church, they may be less likely to fib in a way that projects virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/ad/instances/cjuwpm2ne00s7say6i1dcxcdw@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-768-1180&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/Intelligencer&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleTablet&quot; data-site=&quot;Intelligencer&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-ti3ubHuE&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuwpyjap001q3h63vks4swg7@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;95&quot;&gt;The BLS study found respondents in the ATUS tend to give an estimate of typical working time that is 5 to 10 percent higher than what shows up in their diaries. But the divergence was not uniform across the population. The largest overestimates came from the people providing the highest estimates: People who said they typically worked 75 or more hours per week tended to provide diaries reflecting 25 hours’ less work per week than they estimated. People claiming to typically work between 65 and 74 hours weekly tended to be overestimating by 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

People overestimate how often they do all sorts of things they “ought” to be doing, often by even larger margins than with work for pay. One study from the 1980s found swim and tennis club members provided estimates of their frequency of use of recreation facilities that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19831800363&quot;&gt;double what was reflected in their clubs’ logbooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Do the people who give inaccurate survey answers about their time use know they’re not telling the truth? Like Drum, I lean toward the view that the deception here is mostly self-deception, especially in the case of gyms and other recreational facilities. Their business models often rely on members overestimating how often they will attend, so they will be willing to pay monthly fees that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/upshot/how-to-make-yourself-go-to-the-gym.html&quot;&gt;in some cases exceed what it would cost to pay per-visit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MuseNet</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;js-excerpt&quot; readability=&quot;16.524475524476&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've created Musenet, a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments, and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the same general-purpose unsupervised technology as &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;GPT-2&lt;/a&gt;, a large-scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&quot;&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt; model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bg-fg-5 color-fg-80 p-0.5 mt-n0.5 mb-2 rounded small-copy&quot; readability=&quot;9.5205479452055&quot;&gt;Through May 12th, we're inviting everyone to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/musenet/#try&quot;&gt;try out&lt;/a&gt; our prototype MuseNet-powered music generation tool! See the Try MuseNet section of the post.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;samples&quot;&gt;Samples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since MuseNet knows many different styles, we can blend generations in novel ways. Here the model is given the first 6 notes of a Chopin Nocturne, but is asked to generate a piece in a pop style with piano, drums, bass, and guitar. The model manages to blend the two styles convincingly, with the full band joining in at around the 30 second mark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;try&quot;&gt;Try MuseNet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prototype of a MuseNet-powered co-composer is included below, and will be available through May 12th (at which point we'll chart a next step based on feedback). It allows only a subset of MuseNet's options. We’re excited to see how musicians and non-musicians alike will use MuseNet to create new compositions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;simple mode&lt;/em&gt; (shown by default), you'll hear random uncurated samples that we've pre-generated. Choose a composer or style, an optional start of a famous piece, and start generating. This lets you explore the variety of musical styles the model can create. In &lt;em&gt;advanced mode&lt;/em&gt; you can interact with the model directly. The completions will take longer, but you'll be creating an entirely new piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tool is currently a prototype, so please be patient! MuseNet's limitations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The instruments you ask for are strong suggestions, not requirements. MuseNet generates each note by calculating the probabilities across all possible notes and instruments. The model shifts to make your instrument choices more likely, but there's always a chance it will choose something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MuseNet has a more difficult time with odd pairings of styles and instruments (such as Chopin with bass and drums). Generations will be more natural if you pick instruments closest to the composer or band’s usual style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;composerandinstrumentationtokens&quot;&gt;Composer and instrumentation tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created composer and instrumentation tokens to give more control over the kinds of samples MuseNet generates. During training time, these composer and instrumentation tokens were prepended to each sample, so the model would learn to use this information in making note predictions. At generation time, we can then condition the model to create samples in a chosen style by starting with a prompt such as a Rachmaninoff piano start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or prompted with the band Journey, with piano, bass, guitar, and drums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can visualize the embeddings from MuseNet to gain insight into what the model has learned. Here we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/&quot;&gt;t-SNE&lt;/a&gt; to create a 2-D map of the cosine similarity of various musical composer and style embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;full pt-1 pt-md-1.5 pb-1 pb-lg-2 my-2.5 small-copy scrim bg-cover&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hover over a specific composer or style to see how it relates to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;longtermstructure&quot;&gt;Long-term structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MuseNet uses the recompute and optimized kernels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/&quot;&gt;Sparse Transformer&lt;/a&gt; to train a 72-layer network with 24 attention heads—with full attention over a context of 4096 tokens. This long context may be one reason why it is able to remember long term structure in a piece, like in the following sample imitating Chopin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also create musical melodic structures, as in this sample imitating Mozart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;my-0.5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music generation is a useful domain for testing the Sparse Transformer as it sits on a middle ground between text and images. It has the fluid token structure of text (in images you can look back N tokens and find the row above, whereas in music there’s not a fixed number for looking back to the previous measure). Yet we can easily hear whether the model is capturing long term structure on the order of hundreds to thousands of tokens. It’s much more obvious if a music model messes up structure by changing the rhythm, in a way that it’s less clear if a text model goes on a brief tangent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dataset&quot;&gt;Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected training data for MuseNet from many different sources. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.classicalarchives.com/&quot;&gt;ClassicalArchives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitmidi.com/&quot;&gt;BitMidi&lt;/a&gt; donated their large collections of MIDI files for this project, and we also found several collections online, including jazz, pop, African, Indian, and Arabic styles. Additionally, we used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12247&quot;&gt;MAESTRO dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformer is trained on sequential data: given a set of notes, we ask it to predict the upcoming note. We experimented with several different ways to encode the MIDI files into tokens suitable for this task. First, a chordwise approach that considered every combination of notes sounding at one time as an individual &quot;chord&quot;, and assigned a token to each chord. Second, we tried condensing the musical patterns by only focusing on the starts of notes, and tried further compressing that using a byte pair encoding scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also tried two different methods of marking the passage of time: either tokens that were scaled according to the piece’s tempo (so that the tokens represented a musical beat or fraction of a beat), or tokens that marked absolute time in seconds. We landed on an encoding that combines expressivity with conciseness: combining the pitch, volume, and instrument information into a single token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;bach piano_strings start tempo90 piano:v72:G1 piano:v72:G2 piano:v72:B4 piano:v72:D4 violin:v80:G4 piano:v72:G4 piano:v72:B5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:B5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:4 piano:v0:G1 piano:v0:G2 piano:v0:B4 piano:v0:D4 violin:v0:G4 piano:v0:G4 wait:1 piano:v72:G5 wait:12 piano:v0:G5 wait:5 piano:v72:D5 wait:12 piano:v0:D5 wait:5 piano:v72:B5 wait:12&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample encoding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During training, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transpose the notes by raising and lowering the pitches (later in training, we reduce the amount of transposition so that generations stay within the individual instrument ranges).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augment the volumes, turning up or turning down the overall volumes of the various samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augment timing (when using the absolute time in seconds encoding), effectively slightly slowing or speeding up the pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412&quot;&gt;mixup&lt;/a&gt; on the token embedding space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also create an inner critic: the model is asked during training time to predict whether a given sample is truly from the dataset or if it is one of the model's own past generations. This score is used to select samples at generation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;embeddings&quot;&gt;Embeddings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added several different kinds of embeddings to give the model more structural context. In addition to the standard positional embeddings, we added a learned embedding that tracks the passage of time in a given sample. This way, all of the notes that sound at the same time are given the same timing embedding. We then add an embedding for each note in a chord (this mimics relative attention, since it will be easier for the model to learn that note 4 needs to look back at note 3, or else at note 4 of the previous chord). Finally, we add two structural embeddings which tell the model where a given musical sample is within the larger musical piece. One embedding divides the larger piece into 128 parts, while the second encoding is a countdown from 127 to 0 as the model approaches the (end) token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see (or rather, hear) what people create! If you create a piece you like, you can upload it to a free service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://instaud.io/&quot;&gt;Instaudio&lt;/a&gt; and then tweet us the link (the co-composer has a tweet button to help with this).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Flutter desktop shells</title>
<link>https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is ongoing to extend Flutter to support desktop as a target environment, allowing developers to create macOS, Windows, and Linux applications with Flutter. On the long run, this effort will create lead to a fully integrated solution where &lt;code&gt;flutter create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flutter run&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;flutter build&lt;/code&gt; work for desktop platforms as they do for mobile platforms, but currently this effort is still under way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-level overview of the status of each platform is provided below. For details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/engine/tree/master/shell/platform/&quot;&gt;the source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; The Flutter desktop APIs are still in early stages of development, and are &lt;strong&gt;subject to change without warning&lt;/strong&gt;. No backwards compatibility, either API or ABI, will be provided. Expect any code using these libraries to need to be updated and recompiled after any Flutter update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;macOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most mature of the desktop platforms (for various reasons, including that it's quite close to iOS, which we already support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes starting with &lt;code&gt;Flutter&lt;/code&gt; are shared with iOS, and should be essentially stable. Classes starting with &lt;code&gt;FLE&lt;/code&gt; are still in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Windows shell is a GLFW placeholder, to allow early experimentation. It will be replaced in the future with a Win32 or UWP shell that allows view-level embedding of Flutter within an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect the APIs for the final shell to be radically different from the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Linux shell is a GLFW placeholder, to allow early experimentation. We would like to create a library that lets you embed Flutter regardless of whether you're using GTK+, Qt, wxWidgets, Motif, or another arbitrary toolkit for other parts of your application, but have not yet determined a good way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect the APIs for the final shell to be radically different from the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing plugins is supported on all platforms, however, there are currently very few plugins that actually have desktop support (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/master/plugins&quot;&gt;such as these plugins from the flutter-desktop-embedding project&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Windows and Linux, only the JSON codec is supported at the moment (which means the Dart side of most existing plugins would need to be changed to implement desktop support). The standard codec should be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tooling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for desktop in the &lt;code&gt;flutter&lt;/code&gt; tool is a work in progress. To use any of the support (such the host machine being listed by &lt;code&gt;flutter devices&lt;/code&gt;), two things must currently be true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must not be on the &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels&quot;&gt;Flutter channel&lt;/a&gt;. This is to make it clear that desktop support is not yet considered stable and production-ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must set the &lt;code&gt;ENABLE_FLUTTER_DESKTOP&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. This is to avoid interfering with existing mobile development workflows while the long-term solution is being worked out (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30724&quot;&gt;#30724&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prebuilt Shell Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop libraries are not currently downloaded by default, but can be downloaded to Flutter's engine artifact cache by running &lt;code&gt;flutter precache&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;--linux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--macos&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;--windows&lt;/code&gt; flag, depending on your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;C++ Wrapper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows and Linux libraries provide a C API. To make it easier to use them, there is a C++ wrapper available which you can build into your application to provide a higher-level API surface. The &lt;code&gt;precache&lt;/code&gt; command above will download the source for this wrapper into a &lt;code&gt;cpp_client_wrapper&lt;/code&gt; folder next to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Shells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is currently no tooling support for desktop shells, you will need to write a runner application yourself, and link in the library, as well as any plugins you are using. This will require some familiarity with doing native development on your platform(s); if you don't already have experience with that, you'll probably want to check back later, when &lt;code&gt;flutter&lt;/code&gt; tool support for desktop is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the headers that come with the library for your platform for information on using them. More documentation will be available in the future; for now it may be helpful to look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/master/example&quot;&gt;the flutter-desktop-embedding example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Flutter library, your application will need to bundle your Flutter assets (as created by &lt;code&gt;flutter build bundle&lt;/code&gt;). On Windows and Linux you will also nee the ICU data from the Flutter engine (look for &lt;code&gt;icudtl.dat&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;bin/cache/artifacts/engine&lt;/code&gt; directory in your Flutter tree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;macOS Note&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently you must set up your FLEView in a XIB, rather than in code (this will change in the future). To do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drag in an OpenGL View.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the class to FLEView.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the Double Buffer option. If your view doesn't draw, you have likely forgotten this step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the Supports Hi-Res Backing option. If you only see a portion of your application when running on a high-DPI monitor, you have likely forgotten this step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;macOS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set up your FLEViewController, before calling &lt;code&gt;launchEngine...&lt;/code&gt;, call &lt;code&gt;-registerWithRegistrar:&lt;/code&gt; on each plugin you want to use. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-objc&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  [XYZMyAwesomePlugin &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;registerWithRegistrar:&lt;/span&gt;
      [myFlutterViewController &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;registrarForPlugin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;XYZMyAwesomePlugin&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]];
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Windows/Linux&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating your Flutter window controller, call your plugin's registrar function. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c++&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;MyAwesomePluginRegisterWithRegistrar&lt;/span&gt;(
      flutter_controller.GetRegistrarForPlugin(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;MyAwesomePlugin&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;));
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flutter Application Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because desktop platforms are not yet fully supported by the Flutter framework, existing Flutter applications are likely to require slight modifications to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Target Platform Override&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications will need to override the target platform for the application to one of the supported values in order to avoid 'Unknown platform' exceptions. This should be done as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the simplest case, where the code will only run on desktop and the behavior should be consistent on all platforms, you can hard-code a single target:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-dart&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;'package:flutter/foundation.dart'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt; debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride;
[...]

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;() {
  debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;TargetPlatform&lt;/span&gt;.fuchsia;
  [...]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the code needs to run on both mobile and desktop, or you want different behavior on different desktop platforms, you can conditionalize on &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the line in &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; above could be replaced with a call to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-dart&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt; If the current platform is desktop, override the default platform to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt; a supported platform (iOS for macOS, Android for Linux and Windows).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt; Otherwise, do nothing.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;_setTargetPlatformForDesktop&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;TargetPlatform&lt;/span&gt; targetPlatform;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;.isMacOS) {
    targetPlatform &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;TargetPlatform&lt;/span&gt;.iOS;
  } &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;.isLinux &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;.isWindows) {
    targetPlatform &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;TargetPlatform&lt;/span&gt;.android;
  }
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (targetPlatform &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {
    debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; targetPlatform;
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the target platform you use will affect not only the behavior and appearance of the widgets, but also the expectations Flutter will have for what is available on the platform, such as fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter applications may default to fonts that are standard for the target platform, but unavailable on desktop. For instance, if the target platform is &lt;code&gt;TargetPlatform.iOS&lt;/code&gt; the Material library will default to San Francisco, which is available on macOS but not Linux or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications will need to set the font (e.g., via &lt;code&gt;ThemeData&lt;/code&gt;) based on the host platform, or set a specific font that is bundled with the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of missing fonts include text failing to display and console logging about failure to load fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your project uses any plugins (unless they have desktop support), they won't work, as the native side will be missing. Depending on how the Dart side of the plugin is written, they may fail gracefully, or may throw errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How to hide from the AI surveillance state with a color printout</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613409/how-to-hide-from-the-ai-surveillance-state-with-a-color-printout/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;AI-powered video technology is becoming ubiquitous, tracking our faces and bodies through stores, offices, and public spaces. In some countries the technology constitutes a powerful new layer of policing and government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;Fortunately, as some researchers from the Belgian university KU Leuven  &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08653&quot;&gt;have just shown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, you can often hide from an AI video system with the aid of a simple color printout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who said that?&lt;/strong&gt; The researchers showed that the image they designed can hide a whole person from an AI-powered computer-vision system. They demonstrated it on a popular open-source object recognition system called &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/&quot;&gt;YoLo(v2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hide and seek:&lt;/strong&gt; The trick could conceivably let crooks hide from security cameras, or offer dissidents a way to dodge government scrutiny. “What our work proves is that it is possible to bypass camera surveillance systems using adversarial patches,” says &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00093819&quot;&gt;Wiebe Van Ranst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, one of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get lost:&lt;/strong&gt; Van Ranst says it shouldn’t be too hard to adapt the approach to off-the-shelf video surveillance systems. “At the moment we also need to know which detector is in use. What we’d like to do in the future is generate a patch that works on multiple detectors at the same time,” he told MIT Technology Review. “If this works, chances are high that the patch will also work on the detector that is in use in the surveillance system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fool’s errand:&lt;/strong&gt; The deception demonstrated by the Belgian team exploits what’s known as adversarial machine learning. Most computer vision relies on training a (convolutional) neural network to recognize different things by feeding it examples and tweaking its parameters until it classifies objects correctly. By feeding examples into a trained deep neural net and monitoring the output, it is possible to infer what types of images confuse or fool the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-1279085685&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes everywhere:&lt;/strong&gt; The work is significant because AI is increasingly found in everyday surveillance cameras and software. It’s even being used to obviate the need for a checkout line in some experimental stores, including &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610006/amazons-checkout-free-grocery-store-is-opening-to-the-public/&quot;&gt;ones operated by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And in China the technology is emerging as a powerful new means of catching criminals as well as, more troublingly, &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html&quot;&gt;tracking certain ethnic groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/b2218d34-fbee-4f1f-ac95-050eb29dd42f&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it lost $702 million in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the profits it made in the second half of last year. The loss, equivalent to $4.10 per share, was far greater than the $1.81 per share that Wall Street analysts, surveyed by FactSet, had forecast. The quarter’s revenue of $4.54 billion fell well short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla had $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter, a 40 percent decline from the figure at the end of last year. The company spent $920 million paying off a bond in March. Tesla’s operations consumed $640 million of cash in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investors had been bracing for the red ink after Tesla said it sold 31 percent fewer vehicles in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company said logistical challenges had hindered deliveries of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China. A reduction in a federal tax benefit for Tesla’s buyers may have weighed on Model 3 sales in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Another weak spot for the company was its solar business, where sales dropped by more than 35 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We expected weak results, but Tesla’s revenue and profit misses were stunning,” Vicki Bryan, chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in an email. “Revenue was soft, but spiking costs for obvious strategy missteps really drew blood at the bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The big question for Tesla is whether the drop in car sales in the first quarter was a temporary phenomenon or something more serious. Sales of Model 3 sedans could recover as the company delivers cars overseas. But demand for the higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles plunged 56 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, even though the company cut the price of the cars at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla said on Wednesday that the reduction in the tax credit might have weakened demand for the Model X and the Model S. The company added that after the price cut, the increase in orders for high-end versions of those models exceeded the available supply. Tesla is also hoping that buyers flock to new versions of the S and X that can travel farther on a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an investor call after the results were announced, a stock analyst asked why Tesla was cutting prices if demand was strong for its products. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, responded that the goal was to make its cars “as affordable as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Analysts had slashed their earnings estimates in recent weeks, and after the anemic delivery numbers, Tesla again faces doubts that it can achieve its goals and meet Wall Street’s financial targets. Its stock was little changed in extended trading after the earnings announcement, but it is down over 30 percent from its most recent high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla said Wednesday that it expected to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 cars in the second quarter, up from 63,000 in the first three months of the year. It said it would lose money again in the second quarter, though less than in the first quarter, and would turn a profit in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla’s supporters are hoping that Model 3 sales will surge and enable the company to meet its target of delivering 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. Tesla affirmed that goal on Wednesday, but said its vehicle production would be “significantly higher than deliveries,” because of the time it takes to transport cars from California to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company is now offering a $35,000 version of Model 3. The lower price may stir up demand for the car, but charging less could make it harder for Tesla to make a profit on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla’s cash position is crucial to the company’s future. Mr. Musk intends to produce new vehicles in volume, including a large truck called the Semi, but setting up the new production facilities would consume large amounts of cash. Many analysts expect that Tesla will have to issue new shares to raise money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Musk, who had previously said the company did not need more capital, indicated that he had changed his mind because Tesla was now in a position to use capital more efficiently. “There is merit to the idea of raising capital at this point,” he told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Gold worth billions smuggled out of Africa</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gold-africa-smuggling-exclusive/exclusive-gold-worth-billions-smuggled-out-of-africa-idUSKCN1S00IT</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gold-africa-smuggling-exclusive/exclusive-gold-worth-billions-smuggled-out-of-africa-idUSKCN1S00IT</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NAIROBI, (Reuters) - Billions of dollars’ worth of gold is being smuggled out of Africa every year through the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East – a gateway to markets in Europe, the United States and beyond – a Reuters analysis has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs data shows that the UAE imported $15.1 billion worth of gold from Africa in 2016, more than any other country and up from $1.3 billion in 2006. The total weight was 446 tonnes, in varying degrees of purity – up from 67 tonnes in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the gold was not recorded in the exports of African states. Five trade economists interviewed by Reuters said this indicates large amounts of gold are leaving Africa with no taxes being paid to the states that produce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous reports and studies have highlighted the black-market trade in gold mined by people, including children, who have no ties to big business, and dig or pan for it with little official oversight. No-one can put an exact figure on the total value that is leaving Africa. But the Reuters analysis gives an estimate of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters assessed the volume of the illicit trade by comparing total imports into the UAE with the exports declared by African states. Industrial mining firms in Africa told Reuters they did not send their gold to the UAE – indicating that its gold imports from Africa come from other, informal sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informal methods of gold production, known in the industry as “artisanal” or small-scale mining, are growing globally. They have provided a livelihood to millions of Africans and help some make more money than they could dream of from traditional trades. But the methods leak chemicals into rocks, soil and rivers. And African governments such as Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia complain that gold is now being illegally produced and smuggled out of their countries on a vast scale, sometimes by criminal operations, and often at a high human and environmental cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artisanal mining began as small-time ventures. But the “romantic” era of individual mining has given way to “large-scale and dangerous” operations run by foreign-controlled criminal syndicates, Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo told a mining conference in February. Ghana is Africa’s second-largest gold producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone in the chain is breaking the law. Miners, some of them working legally, typically sell the gold to middlemen. The middlemen either fly the gold out directly or trade it across Africa’s porous borders, obscuring its origins before couriers carry it out of the continent, often in hand luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a major gold producer but one whose official exports amount to a fraction of its estimated production: Most is smuggled into neighboring Uganda and Rwanda. “It is of course worrisome for us but we have very little leverage to stop it,” said Thierry Boliki, director of the CEEC, the Congolese government body that is meant to register, value and tax high-value minerals like gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customs data provided by governments to Comtrade, a United Nations database, shows the UAE has been a prime destination for gold from many African states for some years. In 2015, China – the world’s biggest gold consumer – imported more gold from Africa than the UAE. But during 2016, the latest year for which data is available, the UAE imported almost double the value taken by China. With African gold imports worth $8.5 billion that year, China came a distant second. Switzerland, the world’s gold refining hub, came third with $7.5 billion worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(GRAPHIC: UAE and Africa's gold - &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmsnrt.rs/2IpuIRY&quot;&gt;tmsnrt.rs/2IpuIRY&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the gold is traded in Dubai, home to the UAE’s gold industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE reported gold imports from 46 African countries for 2016. Of those countries, 25 did not provide Comtrade with data on their gold exports to the UAE. But the UAE said it had imported a total of $7.4 billion worth of gold from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UAE imported much more gold from most of the other 21 countries than those countries said they had exported. In all, it said it imported gold worth $3.9 billion – about 67 tonnes – more than those countries said they sent out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of gold leaving Africa without being captured in our records,” said Frank Mugyenyi, a senior adviser on industrial development at the African Union who set up the organization’s minerals unit. “UAE is cashing in on the unregulated environment in Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dubai Customs Authority referred Reuters’ queries to the UAE foreign ministry, which did not respond. The UAE government media office referred Reuters to the UAE federal customs authority, which also did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the discrepancies in the data analyzed by Reuters necessarily point to African-mined gold being smuggled out through the UAE. Small differences could result from shipping costs and taxes being declared differently, a time-lag between a cargo leaving and arriving, or simply mistakes. And gold analysts say some of the trade, especially from Egypt and Libya, could include gold that has been recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 11 cases, the per-kilo value that the UAE declared importing is significantly higher than that recorded by the exporting country. This, said Leonce Ndikumana, an economist who has studied capital flows in Africa, is a “classic case of export under-invoicing” to reduce taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Salomon, an American economist who has researched the use of trade statistics to identify illicit financial flows, said the issue deserves scrutiny. “Persistent discrepancies in the trade of particular goods and between particular countries ... can identify significant risks of illicit activity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POLLUTION, CONFLICT AND BANDITS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, high demand for gold has made it attractive for informal miners to use digging equipment and toxic chemicals to boost the yield. Contaminated water is returned to rivers, slowly poisoning the people who need the water to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-scale miners have long used mercury – easy to buy at around $10 for a thumb-sized vial – to extract flecks of gold from ore, before sluicing it away. Mercury’s toxic effects include damage to kidneys, heart, liver, spleen and lungs, and neurological disorders, such as tremors and muscle weakness. Cyanide and nitric acid are also being used in the process, according to researchers and miners in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial mining companies have also been responsible for pollution, ranging from cyanide spills to respiratory problems linked to dust produced by mining operations. But almost a dozen states including DRC, Uganda, Chad, Niger, Ghana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Mali and Sudan have complained in the past year about the harms of unauthorized mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkina Faso has banned small-scale mining in some areas where al Qaeda-linked Islamists are active, and earlier this month Nigeria’s government suspended mining in the restive northwestern state of Zamfara, saying intelligence reports established what it called “a strong and glaring nexus” between the activities of armed bandits and illicit miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong prices have fueled the boom. Today, gold trades at over $40,000 per kilo, which is below a peak from 2012 but still four times the level of two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western investors want gold so they can diversify their portfolios; India and China want it for jewelry. But most Western companies – and the banks that finance them – avoid handling non-industrial African gold directly. They are unwilling to risk using metal that may have been mined to fund conflict or that may have involved human rights abuses in, for instance, DRC or Sudan. Various Uganda-based traders have been sanctioned for handling gold smuggled out of DRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DESTINATION DUBAI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other states, including the UAE, these concerns have been less of a problem. Over the last decade, gold from Africa has become increasingly important for Dubai. From 2006 to 2016, the share of African gold in UAE’s reported gold imports increased from 18 percent to nearly 50 percent, Comtrade data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE’s main commodity marketplace, the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre (DMCC), calls itself on its website “your gateway to global trade.” Trading in gold accounts for nearly one-fifth of UAE’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no big industrial companies reached by Reuters – including AngloGold Ashanti, Sibanye-Stillwater and Gold Fields – say they send gold there. Reuters contacted 23 mining companies with African operations, the smallest of which produced around 2.5 tonnes in 2018: 21 of them said they did not send metal to Dubai for refining, the other two did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the big South African miners have local refining capacity, the main reason others gave is that no UAE refineries are accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), the standard-setter for the industry in Western markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LBMA is “not comfortable dealing with the region” because of concerns about weaknesses in customs, cash transactions and hand-carried gold, its chief technical officer Neil Harby told Reuters. Investigators and people in the gold industry say the ease with which smugglers can carry gold in their hand-luggage on planes leaving Africa helps gold flow out unrecorded. And limited regulation in UAE means informally mined gold can be legally imported, tax-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold can be imported to Dubai with little documentation, African traders told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DMCC spokesman said it has a robust regulatory framework that includes strict responsible sourcing rules. These are aligned with the international benchmark for responsible sourcing laid out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanjeev Dutta, head of commodities at DMCC, said in January that the center is building strategic relationships with most gold-producing countries on the African continent, “and we are very confident of how that production is done and how responsible” it is. Over the past 12 months, he said, DMCC has firmed up a standard for refineries, called Dubai Good Delivery, which he said is very strict on responsible sourcing and sustainability. “We track right from responsible sourcing to sustainable development, things like human rights etc.,” he said. “We demand export certificates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “very limited” number of refineries accept gold that has been imported as hand luggage, Dutta said, but gave no figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GOLD TO GO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some African miners are swapping their pickaxes and shovels for diggers and crushers – increasing production volumes exponentially. Regulation remains scant, and accidents are frequent. In one week this February, three accidents at illegal mining operations in Zimbabwe, Guinea and Liberia claimed the lives of more than 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, miners must surrender a cut of their output, as commission, to the people who control a pit, let out the equipment, or buy and sell the gold. NGOs such as Global Witness and Human Rights Watch have documented child labor, corruption and links to conflict at some of these mines. At one mine in Zimbabwe visited by Reuters, people said they had to hand over some of their find before they would even be allowed out of the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters presented its analysis to 14 African governments. Of them, five said it reflected an existing concern about gold being smuggled out of their countries that they are trying to address. One said they did not think gold smuggling was a problem for them. The rest declined to comment or did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments across Africa are trying to work out how to manage a sector that, whatever its risks, provides a livelihood for many of their citizens, and which could be harnessed as a source of revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, including Ivory Coast, are taking gradual steps to regulate their informal mining operations. Ghana and Zambia have sent security forces into mining areas to halt operations so miners can be registered and regulations put in place. Ghana, concerned that a rush of mainly Chinese-led ventures is harming the environment, has arrested hundreds of Chinese miners and expelled thousands in the past six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last month, Ghana temporarily banned the import of excavator equipment to try to stem a surge in illegal mining using heavy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sudan, one of the continent’s biggest producers, the government has unveiled a $3 billion plan for private banks to work with the central bank to buy gold from small-scale miners, offering prices that would make it less attractive to sell on the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tanzanian parliamentary report estimated that 90 percent of annual production of informally mined gold is smuggled out of the country: The government wants the central bank to buy this up. In March, President John Magufuli launched a plan to establish hubs where the trade would be formalized by offering access to financing and regulated markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Burkina Faso, Oumarou Idani, minister of mines, believes his country is leaking gold to UAE on a massive scale. Of the 9.5 tonnes of gold the government estimates informal miners dig up each year, just 200 to 400 kg are declared to the authorities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the gold is smuggled from landlocked Burkina Faso to its Atlantic coast neighbor Togo, according to the minister. In Togo, virtually no taxes are imposed on gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Togo’s director of mining development and controls, Nestor Kossi Adjehoun, said informal mining is “an area that we have not properly figured out.” For now, he said, Togo saw no reason to suspect gold was being smuggled through the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I understand that Dubai is the destination for this gold,” his Burkina Faso neighbor, Minister Idani, told Reuters in an interview last year. “But since (the trade) is fraudulent, I have no details.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Massachusetts Court Blocks Warrantless Access to Real-Time Location Data</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/massachusetts-court-blocks-warrantless-access-real-time-cell-phone-location-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/massachusetts-court-blocks-warrantless-access-real-time-cell-phone-location-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's heartening news for our location privacy out of Massachusetts this week. The Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest court, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/commonwealth-v-almonor-massachusetts-supreme-judicial-court-opinion&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that police access to real-time cell phone location data—whether it comes from a phone company or from technology like a cell site simulator—intrudes on a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy. Absent exigent circumstances, the court held, the police must get a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/commonwealth-v-almonor-massachusetts-supreme-judicial-court-opinion&quot;&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Almonor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, police had a phone carrier “ping” the cell phone of a suspect in a murder case—surreptitiously accessing GPS functions and causing the phone to send its coordinates back to the phone carrier and the police. This real-time location data pinpointed Mr. Almonor’s phone to a location inside a private home. The state argued it could warrantlessly get cell phone location data to find anyone, anytime, at any place as long as it was less than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/massachusetts-court-rules-cell-tracking-requires-warrant&quot;&gt;six hours&lt;/a&gt; old. A trial court disagreed and the state appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/almonor-amicus-brief-eff-aclu&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in this case in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclum.org/&quot;&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://macdl.com/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers&lt;/a&gt;. We asked the court to recognize, as the Supreme Court did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/victory-supreme-court-says-fourth-amendment-applies-cell-phone-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. v Carpenter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that people have a constitutional right to privacy in their physical movements. We argued that, because people have their phones with them all the time, and because the location information produced by the phone can reveal our every move—where and with whom we live, socialize, visit, vacation, worship, and much more—the police must get a warrant to access this sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts court held that “[m]anipulating our phones for the purpose of identifying and tracking our personal location presents an even greater intrusion” than accessing the historical location data at issue in &lt;em&gt;Carpenter.&lt;/em&gt; It concluded that “by causing the defendant's cell phone to reveal its real-time location, the Commonwealth intruded on the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy in the real-time location of his cell phone.” The court recognized both that cell phone use is ubiquitous in our society, and that a phone’s location is a “proxy” for its owner’s location. The court noted that “society's expectation has been that law enforcement could not secretly and instantly identify a person's real-time physical location at will,” and “[a]llowing law enforcement to immediately locate an individual whose whereabouts were previously unknown by compelling that individual's cell phone to reveal its location contravenes that expectation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the majority’s opinion focuses on the fact that, in this case, law enforcement directed the phone company to “manipulate” the defendant’s phone, causing it to send its location to the phone company. In other words, the phone company wouldn’t have collected the data on its own as part of its normal business practices. But two judges, in a concurring opinion, expressed concern that this focus on law enforcement action—rather than on the collection of location data alone—would result in an exception for searches of real-time location data that providers collect automatically. The concurring justices would hold that the Massachusetts constitution “protects us from pings not because of the right to keep the government from interfering with our cellular telephones, but because of the right to keep the government from finding us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very concerning because, as the concurring justices note, the majority’s focus on government action here could allow the police to “side-step the constitutional protection” by just asking for the data the cell service provider collects on its own. Although the majority denied that would happen, it remains to be seen, both how officers will implement searches after this opinion and how lower courts will apply constitutional law to those searches. We’ve seen the Commonwealth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/massachusetts-court-rules-cell-tracking-requires-warrant&quot;&gt;interpret this court’s prior decisions on location tracking&lt;/a&gt; very narrowly in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the defendant raised both federal and state constitutional claims in &lt;em&gt;Almonor&lt;/em&gt;, the court based its decision solely on Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which was drafted before—and served as one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mass.gov/guides/john-adams-the-massachusetts-constitution&quot;&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; for—our federal Bill of Rights. Article 14, one of the cornerstones of the Massachusetts Constitution, is the state’s equivalent to the Fourth Amendment. As the court notes, it “does, or may, afford more substantive protection to individuals than that which prevails under the Constitution of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts around the country are now being asked to address the scope of the &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; ruling. &lt;em&gt;Almonor&lt;/em&gt; in Massachusetts and a case called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/odonnell-amicus-brief-eff-aclu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Maine v. O’Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in Maine are among the first to deal directly with how &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; should be applied when police track and locate people in real-time. We’re heartened that the Massachusetts court took these issues seriously and made clear that the police must get a warrant, whether they access &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/massachusetts-requires-warrants-cell-tracking&quot;&gt;historical cell phone location data&lt;/a&gt; or whether they cause a phone to send its real-time location. We’re still waiting for the Maine court’s opinion in &lt;em&gt;O’Donnell,&lt;/em&gt; and we’re actively tracking other cases addressing these issues across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>There's heartening news for our location privacy out of Massachusetts this week. The Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest court, ruled that police access to real-time cell phone location data—whether it comes from a phone company or from technology like a cell site simulator—intrudes on a...</og:description>
