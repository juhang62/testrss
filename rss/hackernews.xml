<title>Tesla hacker reveals what driver-facing camera is looking for</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://electrek.co/2020/10/04/tesla-hacker-driver-facing-camera-looking-for/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Tesla hacker has revealed what Tesla’s driver-facing camera in Model 3 and Model Y is looking for — hinting at driver monitoring feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-149582&quot;/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle author_ad&quot; data-ad-host=&quot;ca-host-pub-5506057612223327&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4655152367470280&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tesla launched the Model 3, it equipped the vehicle with &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2017/08/01/tesla-model-3-driver-facing-camera-autopilot-tesla-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;a standard cabin-facing camera located in the rearview mirror.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the automaker said that the camera wasn’t active and it would be used in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Elon Musk said that it would be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2020/04/12/elon-musk-tesla-cabin-facing-camera-reason/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;prevent people from vandalizing cars&lt;/a&gt; when they are being driven automatically on Tesla’s upcoming self-driving robotaxi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost 3 years, the camera was not used in the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles until earlier this year when &lt;a aria-label=&quot;undefined (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2020/06/18/tesl-software-update-2020-24-new-features-camera/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Tesla activated the camera for the first time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company started collecting images and clips for research purposes with consent from the drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Help Tesla continue to develop safer vehicles by sharing camera data from your vehicle. This update will allow you to enable the built-in cabin camera above the rearview mirror. If enabled, Tesla will automatically capture images and a short video clip just prior to a collision or safety event to help engineers develop safety features and enhancements in the future. As usual, you can adjust your data sharing preferences by tapping Controls &amp;gt; Safety &amp;amp;Security &amp;gt; DATA Sharing &amp;gt; Camera Analytics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is not actively using the camera to monitor drivers’ attention and instead, the automaker says that it only uses the data without being attached to specific drivers to improve existing features and future ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It led some to believe that Tesla could be working on eventually releasing active driver monitoring features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tesla hacker ‘&lt;a aria-label=&quot;undefined (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1312607693249667073&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;‘, known for revealing many features in Tesla’s software, has discovered what events the automaker is trying to detect with the driver-facing camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BLINDED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DARK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EYES_CLOSED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EYES_DOWN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EYES_NOMINAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EYES_UP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HEAD_DOWN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HEAD_TRUNC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOOKING_LEFT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOOKING_RIGHT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHONE_USE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SUNGLASSES_EYES_LIKELY_NOMINAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SUNGLASSES_LIKELY_EYES_DOWN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s only active driver monitoring feature when Autopilot is engaged is detecting if torque is being applied to the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other driver-assist systems, like GM’s Supercruise, are using cabin-facing cameras to make sure drivers are looking at the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Elon has talked down on driver-monitoring based on gaze tracking, but it looks like that’s what Tesla is working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Tesla will release such a driver monitoring feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might just be researching to see if it’s possible to make a useful one with the existing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I am happy that they are actively working toward better driver monitoring because it’s currently one of the biggest weaknesses of Tesla’s Autopilot in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll follow-up here with a summary once we have more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're truly sorry for the interruption today. We appreciate your patience and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, users should be able to access Slack and send messages, but may encounter trouble with some features not working as expected, such as files not uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601930498&quot;&gt;1:41 PM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've updated our services affected here to include all services, as all services could be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some users may be unable to access Slack or certain features, such as seeing a &quot;Something's gone awry&quot; error message when using Slack calls. We'll report back soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601927011&quot;&gt;12:43 PM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601923182&quot;&gt;11:39 AM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigation is still ongoing, but the scope has stayed the same. We’ll update you again in a half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601917592&quot;&gt;10:06 AM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No new updates for the moment as we're continuing to investigate. Customers may notice that other functionality, such as Search, is also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601916025&quot;&gt;9:40 AM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no changes to report as of yet, but we're continuing to dig in on our side and will update you again in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601914088&quot;&gt;9:08 AM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users may be unable to connect to Slack, while others are still experiencing general performance issues. Our team is working to get to the bottom of this and we will share more news soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;off_gray margin_top_6px date&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot; data-timestamp=&quot;1601912413&quot;&gt;8:40 AM PST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

<title>Police are requesting data from smart speakers</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/star-witness-your-smart-speaker/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/star-witness-your-smart-speaker/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon doesn’t provide granular data on what police are seeking, but Douglas Orr, head of the criminal justice department at the University of North Georgia, says police now look for smart home data as routinely as data from smartphones. Data on a smartphone often points officers towards other devices, which they then probe as the investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By amending a search warrant, police can “keep going to keep collecting data,” Orr says. “That usually leads to an Echo or at least some other device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Orr explains, officers are getting more savvy about smart home devices, creating templates that simplify requesting data. Police departments often share these templates, he says, tailoring requests for the specifics of the case they’re investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s Nest unit reported &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://nest.com/legal/transparency-report/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://nest.com/legal/transparency-report/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing police demands&lt;/a&gt; for data from its smart speakers through 2018. Google then stopped reporting Nest data separately, including such requests in its broader corporate &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;amp;user_requests_report_period=series:requests,accounts;authority:US;time:&amp;amp;lu=user_requests_report_period&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;amp;user_requests_report_period=series:requests,accounts;authority:US;time:&amp;amp;lu=user_requests_report_period&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows increased requests for Google user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;pullquote-embed pullquote-embed--text-align-left&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-embed__content&quot;&gt;“This could be the first time an Amazon Alexa recording is used to exonerate somebody.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-embed__content&quot;&gt;Christopher O’Toole, lawyer for Adam Crespo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their terms of service, most major apps and websites include a clause warning users that companies may hand over their data if requested by the government. Law enforcement agencies file subpoenas or search warrants for data, detailing to judges what evidence they expect to find on the devices and how it may serve the investigation. Amazon and Google both notify users of a request for data unless the order itself forbids it. Any number of entities can request user data, but the companies say they &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prioritize requests&lt;/a&gt; based on urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things like Homeland Security, they're going to take high priority,” explains Lee Whitfield, a forensic analyst. “Other law enforcement requests will come in under that. And then things like divorce cases or civil cases, they have a lower ranking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company “objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands” from law enforcement and referred WIRED to its policy on &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYSDRGWQ2C2CRYEF&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYSDRGWQ2C2CRYEF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government requests&lt;/a&gt;. A Google spokesperson also referred WIRED to its &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;updated policy&lt;/a&gt; on requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forensic experts tell WIRED that information from the devices is valued because it can offer a timeline of a person’s activities, their location, if they’re alone, and can verify statements made during questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usually the alibi you get is, ‘I was at home.’ Nobody can confirm that,” says Orr, the criminal justice professor. “So you ask, ‘Do you have a speaker?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orr has studied &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322881021_Alexa_did_you_get_that_Determining_the_evidentiary_value_of_data_stored_by_the_AmazonR_Echo&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322881021_Alexa_did_you_get_that_Determining_the_evidentiary_value_of_data_stored_by_the_AmazonR_Echo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the types of data&lt;/a&gt; police can pull from smart speakers like the Amazon Echo. Voice clips are only the beginning, he says. Speakers keep time-stamped logs of user activity. Police can examine these logs to get a sense of what someone was doing around the time of an alleged crime.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I built a lay-down desk</title>
<link>https://blog.luap.info/drafts/i-built-a-lay-down-desk.html?hnn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.luap.info/drafts/i-built-a-lay-down-desk.html?hnn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After spending part of the last 12 months &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/travelling-with-24-monitors.html&quot;&gt;travelling in Europe&lt;/a&gt; I'm now settling down around Paris and I need to adapt my multi-screens setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably have seen an ads for &lt;a href=&quot;https://altwork.com/&quot;&gt;the altwork desk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a $7000 desk that let you work laying down&lt;/em&gt;. Spending a big part of my day in front of a computer I want to have the most comfortable position as possible, but well $7000 + $1000 for the delivery seems so expensive. There is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ergoquest.com/&quot;&gt;this company&lt;/a&gt; but this is still about $4000 all included. Let's be creative and build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;complete desk&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/complete.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I have to take into account are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three monitors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no diy tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a laying down position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be easy to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be light and not take too much space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only a bike to move the parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't found anyone who has done something similar and so don't really have examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead of doing the waterfall way I decided to go the agile way and to not do any plans, I didn't know what to expect, so let's do it step by step and see how it goes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take care of the chair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built a chair from scratch including the 'mattress' part&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a reclined chair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adapt a chair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue with the first option is that I will not be sure of the result, is it going to be comfortable ? How I'm going to wash the seat covers ? I have no idea of the things to take into account for building a comfortable chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reclined chairs are great but they are very heavy (except the garden ones but not very comfortable) and expensive. So again let's be creative, I got inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikeahackers.net/2017/04/poang-gravity-recliner.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikeahackers.net/2020/04/remove-poang-arms.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; ikea hacks which use a IKEA POANG chair and transform it into a reclined chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the result :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ikea poang adaptation&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/chair.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chair is 69 euro, I had to buy three cushions to extend it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most complex part was to do 7km with the chair on a bike. I do not recommend doing the same, particularly because I have done it on a rainy day but well a bit of challenge in my life is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;ikea bike&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/ikea_bike.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, the chair is comfortable, let's do something for the desk part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What structure for the desk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue you are going to have with the lay down position, is that the desk is going to be on your legs and you cant 'enter' or 'leave' the desk if you can't move the desk. So you need the 'desk' part to be dynamic from the 'chair' part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two ideas for that, either the Altwork way, the structure goes above your head and can incline, or the the base is on the side and the desk can move somewhere (writing that, having the desk in front of me, I wonder if having the base where the foot are is not an even better solution ? Damn, too late). Having the base on the side seems better because it would be smaller and lighter and also you can balance the weight much better. But the structure also needs to be more rigid and I need to find a way to incline the desk, anyway I haven't found a way to do it :(, after a night of thinking I went the altwork way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base + the incline system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desk + the screen supports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Base + incline system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base is pretty standard, you need something strong enough so that it can suppot the whole thing. At that point I still didn't know the weight of the complete platform so I didn't know how strong it should be. After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the complex part, how to design the rotation part ? How heavy is going to be the rest of desk ? How much does the desk need to move so that I can 'enter' the desk ? So many questions I didnt have an answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's try something and see how it goes, I bought an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00H8SZ87W&quot;&gt;gaz actuator on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; which can support 70kg with a range of 31cm, it is built for cars and pretty cheap, 19euro. Actually 70kg is a lot. So at least I have a some freedom on the weight of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two issues with the actuator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;70kg IS A LOT, it is so much that when I was fixing it on the wood of the base, it was breaking the wood. The best would be to have an iron piece that I can fix to the wood but I didnt have the tools for that so I used stronger woods but this is still fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;fixation verrin&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/fixation_verrin.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The desk follows a circular trajectory when you move it up and down. As a result the barycenter of the structure changes depending on the Y position of the 'desk part' and so there is more strength applied on the actuator when it is up than when it is down. So basically the desk will not stay by itself when in the up position. I need to find a way to get the desk in the up position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not really proud of the way I've done it, but it somewhat works. I've built a piece of wood that inserts itself in the area between the two poles where the actuator is. There is a counterweight which drags the piece into the zone when in up position, and when I want to release it, I just need to pull on the rope. (I think I will replace the actuator with a real electric actuator when the current system breaks so that I can control the movement, it is about 120euro)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;system block&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/blocking_system.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Desk + screens support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a chipboard plate of 80cm x 120cm, and cut some space for my body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;plaque bois&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/agglo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty solid, so I can directly screw this plate to the pole and we have a desk surface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;plaque bureau&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/bureau_with_plaque.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For holding the monitors I did something pretty basic, I created a box for each screen. Then comes the position of the screen, how to know the position of each screen ? I didnt know how to know it beforehand, so I just created dynamic arms and adjusted them while in front of the screens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;support monitor&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/support_monitor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only a few days old so I can't really make a feedback but there are already a few things that I need to fix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't use a mouse anymore, as the mouse would fall down, I'm probably going to replace it by a trackball&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to invest in an ergonomic keyboard to get really comfortable, probably going to buy the kenesis advantage 2, but this is expensive !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of the complete desk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to build this kind of structure, I'm not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn't expect, like when you code: if you want to modify the actuator when the 60kg setup is mounted how do you do ? (I have done it 6 times) When your base can't support the weight because it lacks one screw and you need to unmount everything what do you do ? ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really annoyed by the actuator part, I hope I will find something more reliable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it cost me :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 euro for tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;130 euro for wood pieces, screws, joins, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;110 euro for the IKEA chair + cushions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and I spent 26 hours working, excluding the transport and the time shopping for pieces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget when you do woodworking to clean afterwards :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;dirty&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.luap.info/drafts/static/desk/dirty_floor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done something similar and know a few advice, please send me an email&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If you wonder whether you can do that or not, everyone can do it, basic woodworking is not complex, you need to know how to cut wood, how to join wood, how to screw and a little bit of imagination, you dont even need a car to transport parts, I transported everything: pole of 2m40, big plate ... on a bike&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fortunately, I don&amp;#039;t squash my commits</title>
<link>https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story of a bug, and how I addressed it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I admit it: I could have given this article all sorts of alternative titles, each of which would have made as much sense as the one I chose. I didn't want to go with some of the other titles I had in mind, because they would give it all away up front. I didn't want to spoil the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently ran into this bug, it took me hours to troubleshoot it, and I was appalled when I realised what the problem was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of that bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several insights from this story, and I admit that I picked the most click-baity one for the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7&quot;&gt;Yak shaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#94bc204499df483897121bb0343f73f7&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on the umpteenth variation of an online restaurant reservations system, and one of the features I'd added was a schedule only visible to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27h%C3%B4tel&quot;&gt;maître d'&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule includes a list of all reservations for a day, including guests' email addresses and so on. For that reason, I'd protected that resource by requiring a valid &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token&quot;&gt;JSON Web Token&lt;/a&gt; (JWT) with an appropriate role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd deployed a new version of the API and went for an ad-hoc test. To my surprise, that particular resource didn't work. When I tried to request it, I got a &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's odd,&quot; I though, &quot;it worked the last time I tried this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is set up with continuous deployment. I push &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; to a remote repository, and a build pipeline takes over from there. It only deploys the new version if all tests pass, so my first reaction was that I might have made a mistake with the JTWT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasted significant time decoding the JWT and comparing its contents to what it was supposed to be. I couldn't find any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also meticulously compared the encryption key I'd used to sign the JWT with the key on the server. They were identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredulous, and running out of ideas, I tried running all tests on my development machine. Indeed, all 170 tests passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I gave up and ran the API on my development machine. It takes all of a 30 seconds to configure the code to run in that environment, so you're excused if you wonder why I didn't already do that. What can I say? I've almost two decades of experience with automated test suites. Usually, if all tests pass, the problem is environmental: a network topology issue, a bad or missing connection string, a misconfigured encryption key, an invalid JWT, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, the problem also manifested on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913&quot;&gt;Not my code &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#b726532ae06844eb8aeaa2c27ca0d913&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, even with hundreds of tests, perhaps some edge case went unnoticed. The only problem with that hypothesis was that this was hardly an edge case. I was only making a &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request with a &lt;code&gt;Bearer&lt;/code&gt; token. I wasn't going through some convoluted sequence of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
GET /restaurants/1/schedule/2020/9/30 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected a successful response containing some JSON, but the result was &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt;. That was the same behaviour I saw in the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, this is indeed a protected resource. If you present an invalid JWT, &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt; is the expected response. That's why I wasted a few hours looking for problems with the the JWT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally, hesitatingly, concluded that the problem might be somewhere else. The JWT looked okay. So, hours into my troubleshooting I reluctantly set a breakpoint in my code and started the debugger. It isn't rational, but I tend to see it as a small personal defeat if I have to use the debugger. Even so, if used judiciously, it can be an effective way to identify problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debugger never hit my breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the beginning of my Controller method looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[&lt;span&gt;Authorize&lt;/span&gt;(Roles = &lt;span&gt;&quot;MaitreD&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]
[&lt;span&gt;HttpGet&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;&quot;restaurants/{restaurantId}/schedule/{year}/{month}/{day}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)]
&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span&gt;ActionResult&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; Get(
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; restaurantId,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; year,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; month,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; day)
{
    &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!AccessControlList.Authorize(restaurantId))
        &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ForbidResult&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My breakpoint was on the first line (the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; conditional), but the debugger didn't break into it. When I issued my &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request, I immediately got the &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt; response. The breakpoint just sat there in the debugger, mocking me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens, it's natural to conclude that the problem occurs somewhere in the framework; in this case, ASP.NET. To test that hypothesis, I commented out the &lt;code&gt;[Authorize]&lt;/code&gt; attribute and reissued the &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request. My hypothesis was that I'd get a &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; response, since the attribute is what tells ASP.NET to check authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis held. The response was &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f&quot;&gt;Test interdependency &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#fdff404f12644a898b6a3e695fb6533f&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate when that happens. It's up there with fixing other people's printers. The problem is in the framework, not in my code. I didn't have any authorisation callbacks registered, so I was fairly certain that the problem wasn't in my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely jump to the conclusion that there's a bug in the framework. In my experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault&quot;&gt;select is rarely broken&lt;/a&gt;. My new hypothesis had to be that I'd somehow managed to misconfigure the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where? There were automated tests that verified that a client could request that resource with a valid JWT. There were other automated tests that verified what happened if you presented an invalid JWT, or none at all. And all tests were passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was fiddling with the tests, I eventually ran a parametrised test by itself, instead of the entire test suite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[&lt;span&gt;Theory&lt;/span&gt;]
[&lt;span&gt;InlineData&lt;/span&gt;(         &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hipgnosta&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, 2024, 11,  2)]
[&lt;span&gt;InlineData&lt;/span&gt;(              &lt;span&gt;&quot;Nono&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, 2018,  9,  9)]
[&lt;span&gt;InlineData&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;&quot;The Vatican Cellar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, 2021, 10, 10)]
&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; GetRestaurantScheduleWhileAuthorized(
    &lt;span&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; name,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; year,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; month,
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; day)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parametrised test has three test cases. When I ran just that test method, two of the test cases passed, but one failed: the &lt;em&gt;Nono&lt;/em&gt; case, for some reason I haven't yet figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand why that test case ought to fail while the others succeeded, but I had an inkling. I commented out the &lt;em&gt;Nono&lt;/em&gt; test case and ran the test method again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One passed and one failing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;The Vatican Cellar&lt;/em&gt; test case was failing. I commented that out and ran the test method again. The remaining test case failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reeks of some sort of test interdependency. Apparently, &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; happens during the first test run that makes succeeding tests pass, but it happens too late for the first one. But what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c&quot;&gt;Bisect &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#c95c3e707f46467abbf8ff02a9594c4c&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then something occurred to me that I should have thought of sooner. This feature used to work. Not only had the tests been passing, but I'd actually interacted with the deployed service, presenting a valid JWT and received a &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once than dawned on me, I realised that it was just a manner of performing a binary search. Since, of course, I use version control, I had a version I knew worked, and a version that didn't work. The task, then, was to find the commit that introduced the defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I've already implied, the system in question is an example code base. While I have a cloud-based production environment, none but I use it. It had been four or five days since I'd actually interacted with the real service, and I'd been busy making changes, trusting exclusively in my test suite. I tend to make frequent, small commits instead of big, infrequent commits, so I had accumulated about a hundred and fifty commits since the 'last known good' deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching through hundreds of commits sounds overwhelming, but using binary search, it's actually not that bad. Pick the commit halfway between the 'last known good' commit and the most recent commit, and check it out. See if the defect is present there. If it is, you know that it was introduced somewhere between the commit you're looking at, and the 'last known good' commit. If it isn't present, it was introduced later. Regardless of the outcome, you know in which half to look. You now pick a new commit in the middle of that set and repeat the exercise. Even with, say, a hundred commits, the first bisection reduces the candidate set to 50, the next bisection to 25, then 13, then 7, 4, 2, and then you have it. If you do this systematically, you should find the exact commit in less than eight iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, as far as I understand it, the algorithm used by &lt;em&gt;Git bisect&lt;/em&gt;. You don't have to use the &lt;code&gt;bisect&lt;/code&gt; command - the algorithm is easy enough to do by hand - but let's see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start a &lt;code&gt;bisect&lt;/code&gt; session with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;mark@Vindemiatrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;MINGW64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;((93c6c35...))&lt;/span&gt;
$ git bisect start

&lt;span&gt;mark@Vindemiatrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;MINGW64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts an interactive session, which you can tell from the Git integration in Git Bash (it says &lt;code&gt;BISECTING&lt;/code&gt;). You now mark a commit as being bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git bisect bad

&lt;span&gt;mark@Vindemiatrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;MINGW64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;~/Documents/Redacted/Restaurant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;((93c6c35...)|BISECTING)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't provide a commit ID at that point, Git is going to assume that you meant that the current commit (in this case &lt;code&gt;93c6c35&lt;/code&gt;) is bad. That's what I had in mind, so that's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now tell it about a commit ID that you know is good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Git is already telling us how many iterations we should expect. You can also see that it checked out a new commit (&lt;code&gt;1f78c9a&lt;/code&gt;) for you. That's the half-way commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I manually ran the test method with the three test cases. All three passed, so I marked that commit as good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Git estimates how many more steps are left and checks out a new commit (&lt;code&gt;5abf65a&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeated the process for each step, marking the commit as either good or bad, depending on whether or not the test passed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you spot the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I saw that diff, the problem almost jumped out at me. I'm so happy that I make small commits. What you see here is, I promise, the entire diff of that commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, you're not familiar with this code base, but even so, you might be able to intuit the problem from the above diff. You don't need domain-specific knowledge for it, or knowledge of the rest of the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give you a hint: I moved a line of code into a lambda expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1cfcd1adb0b24b6098aa250c73f5cba2&quot;&gt;Deferred execution &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#1cfcd1adb0b24b6098aa250c73f5cba2&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above commit, I extracted a helper method that I called &lt;code&gt;CreateTokenValidationParameters&lt;/code&gt;. As the name communicates, it creates JWT validation parameters. In other words, it supplies the configuration values that determine how ASP.NET figures out how to authorise an HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, it sets the &lt;code&gt;RoleClaimType&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code&gt;&quot;role&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. By default, the &lt;code&gt;[Authorize]&lt;/code&gt; attribute is looking for a role claim with a rather complicated identifier. Setting the &lt;code&gt;RoleClaimType&lt;/code&gt; enables you to change the identifier. By setting it to &lt;code&gt;&quot;role&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, I'm telling the ASP.NET framework that it should look for claims named &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; in the JWT, and these should be translated to role claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly, this is for backwards compatibility reasons. You have to set &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytokenhandler.defaultmapinboundclaims&quot;&gt;JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that this is a global variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the line of code that does that conceptually belongs together with the other code that configures the JWT validation parameters, so I moved it in there. I didn't think much about it, and all my tests were still passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened, though, was that I moved mutation of a global variable into a helper method that was called from a lambda expression. Keep in mind that lambda expressions represent code that may run later; that execution is deferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By moving that mutation statement into the helper method, I inadvertently deferred its execution. When the application's &lt;code&gt;Startup&lt;/code&gt; code runs, it configures the service. All the code that runs inside of &lt;code&gt;AddJwtBearer&lt;/code&gt;, however, doesn't run immediately; it runs when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why all tests were passing. My test suite has plenty of self-hosted integration tests in the style of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/outside-in-tdd&quot;&gt;outside-in test-driven development&lt;/a&gt;. When I ran all the tests, the deferred code block would run in some other test context, flipping that global bit as a side effect. When the test suite reaches the test that fails when run in isolation, the bit is already flipped, and then it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me hours to figure out what the problem was, and it turned out that the root cause was a global variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global variables are evil. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cbf70c019a264e8fa861e13536db688f&quot;&gt;Can't reproduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#cbf70c019a264e8fa861e13536db688f&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you figure out what the problem is, you should reproduce it with an automated test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and how do I do that here? I already had tests that verify that you can &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; the desired resource if you present a valid JWT. And &lt;em&gt;that test passes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way I can think of to reproduce the issue with an automated test is to create a completely new, independent test library with only one test. I considered doing that, weighed the advantages against the disadvantages and decided, given the context, that it wasn't worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, though, that I had to accept that within the confines of my existing testing strategy, I can't reproduce the defect. This doesn't happen to me often. In fact, I can't recall that it's ever happened to me before, like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2ae70aa4524e48bf9b0190aeaa158192&quot;&gt;Resolution &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/10/05/fortunately-i-dont-squash-my-commits/#2ae70aa4524e48bf9b0190aeaa158192&quot; title=&quot;permalink&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me hours to find the bug, and ten seconds to fix it. I just moved the mutation of &lt;code&gt;JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims&lt;/code&gt; back to the &lt;code&gt;ConfigureAuthorization&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple insights to be had from this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global variables are evil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary search, or bisection, is useful when troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all bugs can be reproduced by an automated test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small commits make it easy to detect problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I've always disliked Git's &lt;em&gt;squash&lt;/em&gt; feature, and here's one of the many reasons to dislike it. Had this happened in a code base with a 'nice history' (as the &lt;em&gt;squash&lt;/em&gt; proponents like to present it), that small commit would have been bundled with various other commits. The problem wouldn't have jumped at me if buried in dozens of other changes.</description>

<title>Amazon turned off customer’s Kindle account, blocking her from her books (2012)</title>
<link>https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;On a dark and stormy night, an employee of your local bookstore strolls into your home, starts tossing books you'd purchased over the last few years into a box, and — despite your protest — takes them all away without saying a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Thankfully that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what happened to Linn Jordet Nygaard. Well, not exactly. The Norwegian woman found herself on the wrong side of bureaucracy, but the outcome was much the same (without as much mud on the carpet): Amazon turned off her Kindle account, blocking her from her own books. And they wouldn't tell her why.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;&quot;Two weeks ago my Kindle started showing stripes on the screen and I contacted Amazon support,&quot; Nygaard told NBC News. &quot;Someone immediately found the Kindle in the system and told me they would replace it free of charge. They could only ship the replacement to UK because it was originally purchased there, and I told them I would find an address the next day. (I live in Norway, but have a friend who lives in London.)&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Nygaard was pleased with Amazon's prompt service, she told us, even though this was her second Kindle to fall victim to &quot;stripes&quot; on the ePaper screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;But when Nygaard attempted to log into her Amazon account the next day, her account was suspended — and with it access to her library of 43 books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Those friendly phone-based customer support folks couldn't access Nygaard's account either, and she was passed on to &quot;account specialists&quot; who only communicated via email. That's when things took a Kafkaesque turn (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as documented by her friend, Martin Bekkelund, on his blog&lt;/a&gt;). A man named Michael Murphy with Amazon UK's &quot;Executive Customer Relations&quot; told Nygaard her account had been determined to be &quot;directly related to another which has been previously closed for abuse of our policies.&quot; Which policies? He wouldn't say. What other account? Murphy wouldn't share that, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Instead, Murphy would only pass on this shrilly authoritarian boilerplate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;blockquoteContainer___326mG relative w-auto mv8 gray-60 blockQuoteContainer&quot; readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq___RvTtE fs-italic ma0&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per our Conditions of Use which state in part: Amazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.Please know that any attempt to open a new account will meet with the same action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Now just to spoil the story, I'll skip to the happy ending for Nygaard: After taking her story public, Amazon saw the error of their ways and restored her Kindle library. She's still waiting on her replacement Kindle, but in the meantime has access to her library through the Kindle iOS app on her iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;But Amazon doesn't get off the hook so easily. When we reached out to the company Monday, their PR representative would only send us a canned response they'd dropped into their customer forum: &quot;We would like to clarify our policy on this topic. Account status should not affect any customer's ability to access their library.&quot; (Amazon loves copying-and-pasting, it seems.) Our follow up question — &quot;Why wasn't [Nygaard] told why her account was cancelled?&quot; — hasn't been answered yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;And it probably won't be. Nygaard's little dust-up with Amazon isn't, in and of itself, a big deal. But it serves as a bitter reminder that we don't ever truly own the digital goods and software we buy online. Instead, we rent them, or hold them in a sort of long-term lease, the terms of which are brokered and policed exclusively by the leaseholder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;As Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow put it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blog post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;blockquoteContainer___326mG relative w-auto mv8 gray-60 blockQuoteContainer&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq___RvTtE fs-italic ma0&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fine print will always have a clause that says you are a mere tenant farmer of your books, and not their owner, and your right to carry around your &quot;purchases&quot; (which are really conditional licenses, despite misleading buttons labeled with words like &quot;Buy this with one click&quot; — I suppose &quot;Conditionally license this with one click&quot; is deemed too cumbersome for a button) can be revoked without notice or explanation (or, notably, refund) at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;The core issue might actually be a simple matter of semantics: when we click a digital button that is labelled &quot;Buy,&quot; we expect that we're actually buying something. But we're not buying anything, we're licensing it. Just last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/abridy/digital-death-copyrights-first-sale-doctrine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first-sale doctrine does not apply to software &lt;/a&gt;— or e-books. Or apps. Nor pretty much everything you &quot;Buy&quot; online that doesn't get shipped to your home in a cardboard box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Those long End User License Agreements you have to read before you use a new piece of software? Those are are legally binding, because you've clicked a button labeled &quot;Agree.&quot; But for some reason, online retailers can label their buttons &quot;Buy&quot; when they actually mean &quot;Rent,&quot; and there's nothing we can do about it save filing a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;You could call Nygaard's experience a tempest in a teapot, a matter of a few hundred dollars worth of goods that, after a little public outcry, were fixed without issue. But you'd still be pretty angry if and when it happens to you. (It is worth noting that despite Amazon's stated policy that customers can still access their previously purchased Kindle library even if their account is suspended, Nygaard couldn't download her books to a new device &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; her account was suspended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;As she explained to us, &quot;Before I started emailing Mr. Murphy, I could not log in to my account from Web or iPhone. And my Kindle screen was broken so the fact that the books were still there didn't help me much.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;I was curious if there was any merit to my idea of attempting to hold retailers to these &quot;Truth in Buttons&quot; terms, so I asked Intellectual Property attorney &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constantinecannon.com/attorneys/sgreenstein.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Seth Greenstein&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/23/what-do-you-really-own-when-you-buy-an-e-book/?section=magazines_fortune&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote about about case law for reselling e-books a couple years back&lt;/a&gt;, if the notion held water. As Greenstein explained in an email to NBC News, it's not all completely settled:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;blockquoteContainer___326mG relative w-auto mv8 gray-60 blockQuoteContainer&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq___RvTtE fs-italic ma0&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sales through Apple and other online retailers are subject to terms of use that set forth the conditions of sale. You may buy a track from the iTunes Store that can be used on a certain number of devices, or a copy of an e-book that comes with restrictions as to the ability to lend or the devices on which it is viewable — a “sale” with “conditions.” The “conditions” apply only to the person who entered into the agreement; they do not necessarily bind a third party.In the patent context, the Supreme Court this term has granted review of a case to determine whether first sale privileges are defeated by a purchase “with conditions.” Typically this arises where the seller marks products “single use only.” The question is whether that is enforceable only under contract law, in which case it applies only to the purchaser; or, as a matter of patent law, against anybody. Why does this make a difference? Take a case I litigated in which Lexmark placed a “single use” type of restriction on its cartridge boxes attempting to prevent its aftermarket competitors from refurbishing and refilling cartridges and selling them for far less than the price of a new cartridge. If the restriction is upheld under patent law, Lexmark could claim these aftermarket companies infringe its patents. If not, the aftermarket competitors may be lawful. The courts found that the first sale doctrine (called “patent exhaustion”) trumpted the single use restriction. Now the Supreme Court will have the last word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;If the world's governments determine that customers don't have the same right of ownership over digital goods as we do over our material goods, the least they could do is force companies Amazon to be truthful about what is sold, and what is actually just rented. And it will probably take a lawsuit or legislative action to force Amazon to speak truthfully about the transactions, if only because it changes the perceived value in a customer's mind: $15 to rent a file that contains a book that can be taken away from you at any time, without explanation or recourse, starts to sound a little expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joel Johnson is a tech &amp;amp; science reporter who lives in Brooklyn. He is undecided about artisanal mayonnaise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On the destruction of America’s best high school</title>

<description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;12.403193612774&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged. They are a national treasure. Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.” Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism? After all, only the most gifted athletes participate. There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;—Carl Sagan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Demon-Haunted World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1996)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like you to feel about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/&quot;&gt;impending destruction&lt;/a&gt; of Virginia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology&quot;&gt;Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan&quot;&gt;Bamyan Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;, and then days later actually did blow them up. Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape. For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected. I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the &lt;em&gt;avoidability&lt;/em&gt;, and yet the finality, of the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline. Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but &lt;em&gt;totally within your control&lt;/em&gt;—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system. Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the teenagerhood—the ironically &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else. I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country. I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html&quot;&gt;Stuyvesant and Bronx Science&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now. The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening. As the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;‘s Jay Matthews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does? It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/&quot;&gt;they did in the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged. But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it. Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS. More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity. And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, the district is &lt;strong&gt;embarrassed&lt;/strong&gt;—note that the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni. To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to &lt;strong&gt;drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; (!!!) the number of White students&lt;/strong&gt;. The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small. Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be &lt;strong&gt;overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant&lt;/strong&gt;; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/&quot;&gt;protesting in front of TJHS&lt;/a&gt; to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction. But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed. The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff &lt;em&gt;weigh&lt;/em&gt; on you so heavily? This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared. On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me. With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them. You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of &lt;em&gt;resentment&lt;/em&gt; toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity, “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong. And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still? Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow? And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: &lt;strong&gt;I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison&lt;/strong&gt;. (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://reyammer.io/rss.png&quot; width=&quot;23px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;news is out&lt;/a&gt;: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the &quot;prof job&quot; for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as &quot;feeling something is not right&quot;, without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that &quot;something is wrong&quot;. I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the &quot;very known things&quot; (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally &quot;more limited&quot; immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is organized in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandatory disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm talking about, and these are personal takes/opinions anyways. Unless you are a bad person, please don't take anything personal. Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on! I love to argue, especially with people with strong and different opinions :-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job&quot;&gt;Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some of my &quot;reasons to stay&quot; are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-a-very-good-job&quot;&gt;It's a very good job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pros is... 🥁: &quot;it's a very good job&quot;. At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a &quot;job&quot; (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean &quot;they kick out&quot;, but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that we got this &quot;it's an actual job&quot; out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to &quot;publish more journal papers...&quot; 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobisec.reyammer.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MOBISEC&lt;/a&gt;, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt; to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctftime.org/event/647&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HXP CTF 2018&lt;/a&gt; and after being referred to as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;probably a top team&lt;/a&gt;&quot; we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-are-surrounded-by-students&quot;&gt;You are surrounded by students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one&quot;&gt;I have deep respect for the role of &quot;profs&quot; in society, and it felt great to be one&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;!!1!]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab until 10PM, work during the weekends, and have no paid vacation? ✔️ Do you treat your students like cheap labor whose only task is to implement your visionary research plan (LOL)? ✔️ Do you come up with ridiculous excuses to put yourself as first author even when the student did all the work? ✔️ Do you engage in sexist/homophobic/racist behavior of any form? ✔️ Huge congrats, you are a terrible person and a disgrace for the academic community. No matter how many papers you have or whether you have a wikipedia page or a statue that looks like you, the only place I have for you is on my shit list 💩📝. You think you are one of them? Shoot me an email with your achievements and let's find out! 😈)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;many-of-my-friends-are-academics-i-will-miss-them--&quot;&gt;Many of my friends are academics, I will miss them :-(&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[OK, this is likely less rational than it should be.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been part of the academic circus for about 10 years, which is a significant portion of my adult life. I do have very good friends in industry, but in terms of numbers, I of course have many more friends in academia. And one non-obvious aspect that made my decision difficult was the fear of losing contact with these friends if I had to make the move. Most of my friends do not live where I live, but I thought I at least would have a chance to catch up at various conferences or when serving in PCs. Leaving academia, these occasions will likely be less frequent. Sadness ensues :-( Being more rational, I don't think this will be a huge problem, and moving to industry I'll be significantly richer anyways and I can even pay for conferences without having to write grant proposals ;-) But still, you get the point: I fear I'll miss my buddies even more than I do now. We'll see how it goes. :/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-social-pressure-a-very-bad-reason-to-stay&quot;&gt;The social pressure (a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad reason to stay!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a lot of time to admit this to myself, but here it is: the social pressure &quot;you are crazy if you leave a tenured prof job&quot; is real, and I think it affected me as well. I perceive the prof job as very prestigious, and for a while it was insane to even consider leaving it. When people, from students who foolishly challenge you at ping pong to uber drivers, ask you &quot;So, what do you do?&quot; and you can answer &quot;I'm a professor&quot; without lying, well, that feels very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here there are other variants of &quot;the pressure&quot;: &quot;after a PhD, the smart kids become profs&quot; or &quot;you want to make your advisor proud? then become a prof&quot;. Nobody said these things to me explicitly, but I need to admit I felt them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, &lt;em&gt;these are absolutely bad reasons to stick with the job&lt;/em&gt;. But even if I've always recognized these reasons as bad ones, actually &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; getting rid of them and avoiding that they clutter your mind when taking decisions, well, that has been a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to be a real &quot;smart kid&quot;? You want to make your advisor proud? Great: then find something you truly like and stick to it! If &quot;making your advisor proud&quot; == &quot;become a prof no matter what&quot;, then your advisor is likely a dumbass (please let me know so that I can update my list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an advisor myself, I just wish for my students to find something they truly like and be the best possible version of themselves. I would personally be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; prouder of a student who has the chance of being a prof but says &quot;fuck it&quot; and starts cultivating tomatoes vs. a student that sticks to the prof job just because it's cool or prestigious (I'm not kidding, and I would envy him/her a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let me tell you: The prof job is a job like any other. Yes, it's competitive to get a position, but the vast majority of the smartest people are very far from being academics, and I can assure you that some profs are very, very dumb. So, this prof thingy is not a very good filter for smartness anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't get fooled by the &quot;I'm good at this, so I must do this&quot; or &quot;I was born to be a professor&quot;. Really, chances are that you are not &quot;too good&quot; to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be a professor. The key question is: do you like it or not? Don't get trapped by some weird stories that many academics push forward. There are many more good candidates than open positions. Nobody is irreplaceable. And if you think you are, stop being delusional. You are not. Which is good news! You do not owe anything to anyone, and you have the freedom to start enjoying your life the way you want!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have friends who I believe are stuck with the prof job and torturing themselves with this pre-tenure madness just because it's cool. I'm convinced this &quot;the job is prestigious&quot; is making many smart humans losing many years of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of these thoughts sounds somehow familiar, maybe it's time for you to sound the alarm bell. If you need some wise words as a wake-up call, here is the best I could come up (don't worry, I wrote them before leaving the job, so they come out of infallible prof wisdom):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our days on this planet are counted. And the days of whoever you are trying to impress are counted as well. So what's the point? Really, it's not worth it, life is too short, and you get only one. Find something you like, regardless of how prestigious it is, strive to be the best version of yourself, and enjoy the ride! 💥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job&quot;&gt;Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LET THE MEGA RANT BEGIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things I don't like about academia, and they are definitively too many to fit even in a mega blog post like this. But since I do not think it would be particularly useful to aim for a comprehensive list of the problems, and since a lot of people already rant about academic issues, this post is more about some aspects for which I did not find much discussion online (at least not in this depth), and a bit on the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, in my very personal opinion, some things are as bad and as frustrating as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discuss a bit how, even with a tenured position, I was not really able to ignore (some of) these problems. This may very well be a personal failure rather than a &quot;it's not possible to ignore them&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, please keep in mind that this is a personal blog post, and it does not have any pretense other than being a &quot;clean&quot; snapshot of my thoughts — especially for the last two aspects I discuss, some people may consider them a &quot;pro&quot; rather than a &quot;con&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;publish-or-perish-the-incentives-are-fucked-not-good&quot;&gt;Publish or perish: the incentives are &lt;del&gt;&lt;del&gt;fucked&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &quot;not good&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academic community has profoundly perverse incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in using incentives as a proxy to determine the health of a community: incentives are what motivate people to do what they do, and they are the basis to select who should move to the next step of their career, whether they are PhD students on the academic job market or whether they are profs trying to get to a higher level of the academic food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest incentive that personally affected me the most is the &lt;em&gt;absolutely insane and unhealthy obsession for publishing&lt;/em&gt;. You heard about the &quot;publish or perish&quot;? Yeah, it's real. I initially thought &quot;tenure can save me from this&quot;, but I don't think it does (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publications are not the only aspect that count, but I believe they have a disproportionate amount of importance for an academic career (at all stages), especially when compared to the net value that some &quot;papers&quot; actually contribute to society and the overall research field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this papers' insanity is the root cause of many problems we have, and it ultimately distracts from what should really matter — expanding our knowledge and sharing our successes and failures with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these incentives are the root cause of a number of problems, which I discuss next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Weirdly enough, while I really don't like this system, I do have profound respect for most of its members. Please don't take anything of this personally — it's a systemic issue. I'm guilty as anyone else and I'm definitively part of the problem.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-1-we-write-papers-that-do-not-deserve-to-be-written&quot;&gt;Problem 1: We write papers that do not deserve to be written&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsession of having to write a full academic paper about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; causes us to spend &lt;em&gt;so much time&lt;/em&gt; writing papers that sometimes barely qualify even for the &quot;quick blog post&quot; bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this has a net &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; overall contribution for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask: How can an additional paper hurt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each peer-reviewed paper, there is an insane amount of overhead to actually write it, going through (often multiple rounds of) reviews, preparing the presentation, attending the conference, etc. The community also spends significant time, by reviewing the paper, discussing it, etc. That's &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you could tell me &quot;but there is value in writing a well-structured academic paper&quot;. Yes, there may be value. But &quot;there is value in X&quot; != &quot;it makes sense to do X&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this &quot;value&quot; really balancing the insane amount of time we lose to make that happen? Is there really a net positive overall contribution for the community? &lt;em&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we seldom ask ourselves this question, and I think in many cases the answer is &quot;no&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, more precisely, I think the incentives are set to actually make it &quot;worth it&quot;, but for the wrong reasons. I'm criticizing that often &quot;it's worth it&quot; to write papers for the mere sake of publishing papers and padding our CVs, and not because we &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; believe it's worth doing so to share our knowledge with the community in the most effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are unreasonable people that exploit these tricks, and there are entire conferences and journals whose mere existence is justified and sustained by this publishing obsession. And as long as the incentives remain the same, and as long as we have &quot;pokemon venues&quot; (&quot;going to catch/accept them all&quot;, got it?), people will still lose time writing these papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Combine this obsession with crazy schemes of &quot;collaborations&quot;... and you can see CVs with 60+ papers published &lt;em&gt;in a year&lt;/em&gt; (More than one per week... let that sink.)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is definitively possible to avoid the super shitty venues and it is possible to focus on the bigger ones where the quality is definitively higher... but with me getting old(er), however, my (&lt;em&gt;very subjective!&lt;/em&gt;) bar for &quot;it is worth writing a full academic paper for X and fight to death to get it accepted somewhere&quot; is getting higher and higher :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: I of course do not let these personal thoughts interfere with my judgment when I serve on PCs. If I feel a paper is above the bar (which is very relative depending on the venue), then I surely fight for acceptance, even if I may not agree that it was worth it to do the effort to write the paper in the first place. Actually, when the paper has been already written and submitted, sometimes by being positive and accepting &quot;marginal&quot; papers we are saving the authors and the community a lot of time.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, there are a couple of categories of papers that, in my opinion, we should not lose (much) time writing and submitting, but for which the incentives push us to write and submit anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Category A: good projects that did not work out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you had a great project idea, but it did not work out. Now, in general, negative results may have value, and it may be worth sharing them. You could write a negative result paper (I think they are valuable). But wait, most conferences don't like those! Shit. So what do you do? You could write a blog post — as detailed as you want, no page limits, etc. you are the boss! — and move on with life with something better? But wait, blog posts &quot;don't count&quot; (more on this later). And in many environments, &quot;no paper&quot; == &quot;I completely lost my time from the eyes of the public&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and that's what pushes us to write full academic papers even for projects that were objectively a failure: we go on a quest to twist reality to sell something as &quot;this is great/novel&quot;, to respin the negative results as &quot;some positive results&quot;, and to build a convincing story around them. And what does it this usually lead to? Oversellings and overclaims, which the academic community is often accused of (and rightfully so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lose &lt;em&gt;so much time&lt;/em&gt; fine-tuning every single sentence of our papers to make sure to have a chance to win the peer-review lottery (and these papers are usually submitted many times before getting accepted, losing even more time of the overall community). But since &quot;publishing papers&quot; is so important, these aspects are now a normal and accepted part of the deal. Argh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Category B: bad projects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are then some projects that should not even be started... But that are rewarded anyways by the current incentives, as long as they are publishable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two variants that seem to be recurring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variant 1: &quot;there is no paper on this topic&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario: We could work on XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi: Mmm... but what would be the point? Isn't XYZ obvious? Doesn't everyone know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario: Yeah... but I didn't see any &lt;em&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/em&gt; paper on this, it could be publishable! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi: 👀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there definitively are well-explored areas of works that would benefit a lot from a systematic overview that an academic paper can provide (I'm a big fan of Oakland's SoKs). I just get mad when I hear people pushing forward a &quot;paper idea&quot; with the &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; argument of &quot;there is no peer-reviewed paper on this&quot;. The real question should be: &quot;would a paper on topic XYZ be a big-enough contribution to the community that makes my time well spent, regardless of its &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; status?&quot; Asking this question? HERESY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variant 2: &quot;it's a step forward&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario: We could work on a new defense mechanism XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi: Mmm... but that looks easily bypassable in all realistic threat models... and it feels very brittle anyways...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario: Don't be so negative. Remember that scientific progress is incremental by nature. XYZ is a step forward, so it could be publishable (and &lt;em&gt;thus&lt;/em&gt; it's worth working on it) 🕶️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi: 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note: &quot;new defense mechanism&quot; is just an example, I've seen this variant even with ridiculous attack papers.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, don't get me wrong: I'm all in favor of supporting people who &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; believe they got an idea that, against all odds, may eventually be successful in the long-term future — this definitively fits in my &quot;great research&quot; bucket! But I often see papers for which I'm ready to bet that even the authors themselves don't believe their proposal would actually work in practice or be relevant/valuable in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm upset that we often hide ourselves behind the &quot;we do a step forward&quot; or the &quot;it could be useful in 100 years&quot; arguments just to find an excuse to work on ideas that even ourselves don't believe in, other than believing in the vastly more important &quot;it could be publishable&quot; aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please, I beg you: the next time you start a project or start writing a full-fledge academic paper on something that did not work out as expected, ask yourself: is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; worth it to spend so much time on that? And is it worth it asking the community to lose time on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I'm quite confident that in most cases, the answer would be: worth it 'for the science'&quot;? No. Worth it for my career (or for the career of my students)? Yeah, sorry :/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a direct consequence of this point, conferences — even so-called &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; conferences — are overwhelmed with submissions, most of which have really marginal contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marginal contributions are great and valuable, but is it really worth it to write 12+ pages for a result that could be summarized in a couple of paragraphs? And is it really worth it to ask 3/4 reviewers (for each conference the paper is submitted to!) to write a full-fledge review on that? And is it really worth it to have PC discussions, rebuttals, re-submissions? And once these papers get accepted (at maybe a minor conference), is it really worth it to organize conferences and have 20-minute presentations on these contributions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we sometimes hide ourselves behind the &quot;there is value&quot; and we forget that this value should be balanced vs. the efforts it requires and time we lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-2-we-optimize-papers-for-the-referee-not-for-the-intended-audience&quot;&gt;Problem 2: We optimize papers for the referee, not for the (intended) audience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &quot;too many submissions&quot; comes the problem of not enough experts to properly cover all submissions in all research areas. Chances are that your paper will be reviewed by someone less expert than you are in your particular area, or someone who is completely clueless. If you consider that this someone may also be very tired by the insane PC load (and that's understandable), and that it's much easier to reject a paper than to accept it, and that systems security folks seem particularly nasty... well, this game sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do we do when the game sucks but we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; play it anyways? We adapt to the rules of the game and we optimize for the only thing that matters: paper acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just writing papers for our &quot;real&quot; target audience (the community), we go all-in with &quot;defensive writing&quot; and we start iper-optimizing every single sentence to make sure it can't possibly be misunderstood even by the dumbest reader. Papers can't just be &quot;clear&quot; for a benign reader: they need to be bulletproof against capricious people who are ready to reject things for random reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just me, but I personally spend an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; part of my writing time for these optimizations. Same goes for the time spent in teaching and providing feedback over these aspects. Now, is defensive writing a good skill to acquire? Yes, I think so. But does it make sense that we are forced to use it for every single paper. No, I think it's madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a mismatch between the &quot;whoever needs to say 'accept'&quot; and the real target audience. We lose so much time optimizing for the &quot;wrong&quot; readers. And I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what I'm most upset about? That I actually &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing. For example, I truly enjoyed writing this blog post, and I really missed writing just for the sake of organizing some thoughts and speaking my mind. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for most research papers I wrote so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish we could write academic papers with the candor of, say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://phrack.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phrack&lt;/a&gt; articles. After 10 years of academic writing, I find myself enjoying that &quot;direct&quot; style so much, regardless of the topic I'm reading about: &quot;here is what I got, here is what I had in mind but didn't have time to try / didn't work, and here is all my code / etc. so that you can start playing on this as well&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishful thinking, I know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-3-we-move-away-from-potentially-very-cool-stuff&quot;&gt;Problem 3: We move away from (potentially) very cool stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my naive mind, academia would provide a &quot;low-risk&quot; environment and safety nets for academics to work on &quot;high risk&quot; projects, or on projects that may be very valuable but may not necessarily lead to a short-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current incentives are not aligned with this spirit, and we find ourselves, once again, needing to optimize for the wrong things: papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen many making the argument that, yes, pre-tenure, that's exactly the case: the only focus should be to publish and get tenure. And thus many make the argument: &quot;tenure is there exactly to allow academics to work on high risk projects&quot;. I understand this argument, but I don't buy it. In most cases, profs are too busy to do the actual research, and that's why they get PhD students and postdocs to do the research for them. PhD students and postdocs have much more time than profs, but guess what they don't have? Tenure. And the cycle begins: it's again very risky to work on risky projects, maybe not for the prof, but for the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it becomes difficult (and maybe immoral?) to try to convince students to work on project X when we know it may not lead to a publication, or when we know it may take a very long time to see the light. Considering that PhDs are 3-year long in many European countries... well, that sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another variant of the same problem: Given a project X, the rule of thumb is to do enough work to get to a good paper, but not (significantly) more. Once the paper is accepted, &quot;that's it&quot;. There is no incentive to keep working on it or to maintain a tool. Unless you have enough material for another paper, it's better to move on. And having &quot;enough&quot; material for a follow up is usually tricky, because the &quot;novelty&quot; factor is gone. (BTW, this triggers another unhealthy optimization: &quot;maybe it's better to leave some results out of paper #1 so that I have more material for a potential paper #2?&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential trick to escape from this madness would be to get tenure and then have only very few students so that you have time to do the &quot;big shot&quot; research yourself. But not many students usually lead to not many papers, which leads to not many grants, which, in some schools, leads to higher teaching load / committee work (AFAIK, that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case at EURECOM), which leads to less free time. Argh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this does not categorically prevent academics to do great work — some groups definitively do amazing stuff! But these groups do that &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; the current incentives, not thanks to them. And when the incentives don't align with what should be the overall goal, well, that makes me sad, doubly so when thinking that these incentives are some self-imposed &quot;counting papers&quot; madness... and for what? Padding our CVs? Seriously, what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-4-non-peer-reviewed-resources-are-often-unjustly-dismissed&quot;&gt;Problem 4: Non-peer-reviewed resources are often unjustly dismissed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's so competitive to publish in peer-reviewed venues and it takes so much time that we somehow feel entitled to unjustly dismiss non-peer-reviewed resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic example when dealing with related work? &quot;Oh, but that's just a blog post.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mentality gets me mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true, many blog post &quot;just&quot; propose an idea and &quot;just&quot; scratch the surface of a given topic. But some blog posts are &lt;em&gt;solid&lt;/em&gt; work and they are more thorough and more fairly evaluated than many peer-reviewed publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get mad when we judge existing resources merely based on the &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; vs. &quot;non-peer-reviewed&quot; status. The question should be &quot;is this good work?&quot;, not &quot;on which platform has this been published?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish we would start valuing resources for what they actually are and for what we actually think of them. Does &quot;resource-published-on-napkin&quot; offer a systematic exploration of problem X? Does it fully solve the problem? Is it properly evaluated? Does it have a good comparison with related work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to all these questions, why shouldn't it count as much as a normal paper? &quot;Peer-reviewed&quot; should be useful to act as a filter. But once you read a blog post and you think it's good, then it should be considered as a good resource, independently from how it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'll tell what you would hear in academic circles: &quot;it's not fair, publishing blog posts is much easier, they don't need to go through the crazy peer-review process, etc.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing? I agree. It's not fair to compete against them. If only we would stop being obsessed with this &quot;not peer-reviewed =&amp;gt; doesn't count&quot; madness... If only even &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; blog posts would start counting more... oh wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We somehow ended up using the &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; bit as a proxy for &quot;is this good work?&quot;, when we ourselves know that the process is deeply flawed, with so many false positives, false negatives, and various degrees of randomness. It's a very sad state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A quick parenthesis on arxiv. A while ago I accidentally (👼) started a mega flame on arxiv vs. not arxiv. Let me clarify once for all: my intent was to bring up the problem that some people follow the spirit of double blind and some people just follow &quot;what's written in the CFP&quot;, which technically allow them to publish on arxiv and talk to journalists to hype it up (thus deanonymizing themselves). I don't know what's the best way to combine blind reviews and arxiv, but, in principle, I really like arxiv and the freedom it grants you. Big fan!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;tenure-does-not-save-you-from-the-publishing-pressure&quot;&gt;Tenure does not save you from the publishing pressure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did I discover the problems above only recently? No, I was aware of most of them before joining the prof job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I thought: French positions come with tenure, I'll do what I want!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I genuinely thought that, LOL. I thought I would be free from the insane publishing pressure. But that's not really the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that I want to be professional. If I'm hired to do job X, I want to do job X. I don't want to keep the job &quot;to scam the system&quot;. If the job is about publishing academic papers, then I want to deliver. I don't like it? Then I should move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second (and more pressing) problem: I chose this job for mentoring students. And what do students need to successfully defend their PhD and have a chance to aim at an academic career? Papers. So many papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I guess you see where I'm going with this: I personally don't care that much about papers anymore, but I do profoundly care about the success of my students. I was super lucky to have two advisors who cared for me, and I want to do my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here I am, getting stuck playing the reviewers lottery game over and over again, deadline after deadline, CCS rebuttal after CCS rebuttal. It's very different than when I was a PhD student myself. Working hard with students, getting papers accepted, making sure the presentation is top-notch, etc.: it's actually fun and it's great to see progress and share successes together. But rejections still hurt, especially the pointless ones. They hurt in a very different way than when I was a student, but they do hurt. It could be that I feel this pressure particularly because of the short &quot;3-year PhD&quot; that we have in France, but I'm not sure. [For reference, I started actually publishing around my 2.5th year (out of 6-year PhD). It takes time to skill up.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum: if you chose academia for the students, I think it's very difficult to &quot;get out of the system&quot;. It's a different game and it's not terrible as when you are PhD student, but the game never ends, and the &quot;pressure&quot; doesn't leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-many-tasks-no-time-for-tech-stuff&quot;&gt;Too many tasks, no time for tech stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;work freedom&quot; is real, but not in the way you may expect. You have a lot of flexibility in deciding on what to work on as research subject. But during these three years I have always felt as &quot;always too busy&quot;. There is an incredible high number of different tasks to juggle, and I feel I spent most of my time playing &quot;catching up&quot; rather than enjoying what I was doing. And I need to admit that, sometimes, the &quot;advertised academic freedom&quot; felt like a lie. I managed to do some technical work for papers during my first year or so, but I needed to work crazy hours to juggle all the tasks. I think I can do it. And it's cool to be able to do it. But I don't enjoy the unhealthy juggling anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I'm the most happy when I can take a hard technical problem and go all-in trying to solve it. I deeply miss the luxury of focusing. Now, I understand that when people progress in their career, the focus and tech portion of the job is usually reduced. I get that, and that's OK. All I need is just a decent tradeoff — and this prof job really doesn't look like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More in general, with all the tasks and the weird incentives (for you and the students), this job ends up being &quot;about tech&quot;, but not a &quot;tech job&quot;. Most of these tasks are &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; technical stuff, but they rarely are actual technical tasks. Nowadays I find myself spending hours discussing (very interesting!) technical things with students or reviewing papers about technical things, but I don't see much technical stuff myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And between the many tasks and mostly non-technical nature, I found it challenging to keep up with the gritty tech details I used to like the most. I know that some colleagues work 60/70/80 hours per week to keep up with everything. But I categorically refuse to accept that to stay up-to-date with the tech knowledge I'm passionate about I need to work that much. (If you manage to stay up to date without working that much, respect!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I value work/life balance, I have a life outside my job, and I have no intention to give that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think, with time, my interests are changing. I love more and more building things and engineering, even if there is no paper at the end (!!!). Unfortunately, as a prof, the time you are expected to spend in this direction is very very low (so far I used my &quot;DEFCON CTF org&quot; card many times to justify investing time in &quot;tech stuff&quot;, but that doesn't last forever :-)). My bet is that I'll be happier with a job that incentives me to dig deeper on technical stuff, rather than just scratching the surface and change as soon as there is paper (if any). The academic job does not look like such a job — luckily my next one seems a pretty good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that by moving to industry I will be learning many more things, but the number of public works/papers with my name on it will likely be much lower. So be it: I prefer to know many things, than being known by many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-much-travelling-not-a-fan-anymore&quot;&gt;So much travelling, not a fan anymore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to enjoy travelling, but I think I burned out. The combination of attending various conferences, giving talks, serving on PCs, going to PI meetings for grants, and my long-distance relationship really took a toll on my quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then COVID hit and I got stuck at home for six months. You know what? I really enjoyed it. The biggest pro of having a calm life? After years of failed attempts, I finally managed to establish many new healthy habits: I started eating in a healthier way, I lost 10kg+ (and I was not particularly overweight), started new hobbies, and I've managed to study two new languages every single day for more than six months (no, don't worry, French is not one of them :-)). I look forward to go back to the occasional trips, but having the &quot;I'm at home&quot; as the new norm is absolutely fantastic. Yeah, I'm getting old 👴.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-location&quot;&gt;The location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of my main issues: the location. This is tricky... many universities are in some random places in the middle of nowhere... Eurecom is on the beautiful French riviera... And yet, I'm finding ways to complain... oh well :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really is about personal taste. There are many people that love the area (for many good reasons), but it turns out it is not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many nice &quot;nature&quot;-related things to explore (which are great!), but I prefer a bigger city with more balanced &quot;life&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other problem I had is that I don't speak French, and I never took the time to learn it. As long as you stay around the school or in other &quot;tech places&quot;, everyone speaks English and it's all good. But when you need to do &quot;normal life stuff&quot;... yeah, you may be able to survive without knowing French, but you will have a tough time. (I saved myself because my mom and my brother both speak French very well, but I have no idea how I would have bootstrapped my life there without them. &amp;lt;3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last aspect I was worried about: the so-called &quot;French attitude&quot;. Truth be told: the vast majority of French people I interacted with are actually super nice and helpful :-) BUT: if you need to send/receive a package or if you need to open a bank account: &lt;em&gt;RUN&lt;/em&gt;. A farewell message to Chronopost and BNP: from the core of my heart, I hope one day you will experience the arrogance, the profound unprofessional attitude, and your overall torture-level customer service that you seem to be proud of. May all your baguettes turn out curved and burned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave&quot;&gt;Part 3: The bye bye — The decision to leave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and after three years of thinking about the pros and cons, it's time for me to move on :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very difficult decision to take and I spent an enormous time thinking about it (not as much time as shortening CCS rebuttals into the words limit, but quite close). I have last few additional thoughts from my introspective journey on how I approached this decision and how and why I eventually decided to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-freedom-vs-work-freedom&quot;&gt;Life freedom vs. work freedom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important aspect for me has always been to find a good location. French riviera didn't cut it, and Vienna seems a &quot;good&quot; alternative... (&quot;#1 city in livability world-wide&quot;-level &quot;good&quot;). I'm also extremely lucky to have found a very smart, beautiful, and unrealistically patient woman, and I have always been absolutely against the idea of taking &quot;one way&quot; decisions (as in &quot;decisions that only optimize for one of the two&quot;). Staying in Vienna looks like a great fit for both us, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always aimed at &quot;work freedom&quot; to be more free in life and enjoy it more. But &quot;work freedom&quot; lately started clashing with &quot;life freedom&quot;, and I picked the latter. Having the best job to then be somehow limited in life serves no purpose (again, that's my subjective opinion). This was enough for me to decide to leave — the other reasons (cons of the current job / pros of the future one) just made it much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;industry-vs-academia-it-is-not-a-black--white-choice&quot;&gt;Industry vs. academia: it is not a black / white choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry vs. academia decision is not as black / white as I once thought. There are many alternatives and shades out there. For example, I primarily chose the academic path for teaching and mentoring... but is academia really the only choice if you want to contribute on teaching/mentoring? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time passing, &quot;traditional profs&quot; have less and less &quot;exclusive access&quot; to vast pools of smart students. Examples? I started learning &quot;security stuff&quot; with blog posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corelanc0d3r&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@corelanc0d3r&lt;/a&gt; (around 2009/2010), not in university. And I learned most of the things I know from public online resources. Another example closer to me is about my MOBISEC class: Each year I had around 50 students in class, but by putting everything publicly online I've reached more students in 2 years than I would have reached with 1000 years of traditional teaching. Sure, the &quot;impact&quot; I have on these online students is much less &quot;deep&quot; than when you have them in class, but some of these online students (whom I have never met) did actually end up reaching out for suggestions/advice (even outside mobile security... and I love it! Please keep these random emails coming :-)). And that's how the &quot;tradeoff&quot; keyword kicks in: it does not need to be black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this direction, I have great plans for the future. First off, watch this space for some MOBISEC announcement :-) Second: I have so many blog posts in the pipeline for a wide range of topics, from whether to do a PhD, to advices for PhD students, to how to pick a good research topic, or a very long list of technical/CTF-related things I've collected notes about. I also plan to keep serving in some PCs, time permitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; way of finding a personal tradeoff between the two worlds I like, but I'm sure there are many others. Find what you like and try to make it fit in the current position you have! And if it doesn't work for you, well, yeah, maybe it's time to move on to something else :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-our-field-industry-looks-damn-attractive&quot;&gt;In our field, industry looks damn attractive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession: I have secretly (?) envied my industry friends for many years, and not for their money. I envied them because they could seemingly have some work/life balance and at the same time spend their time on something technical and used &quot;for real&quot;. There are many jobs in industry that I consider exceptionally interesting. In academia, in those occasions in which we do something that &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be useful, we often need to hope that someone else &quot;picks it up&quot; and builds something on top of it... and even if that happens, in most cases you will never know if something changed specifically thanks to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about being able to brag. It's about saying &quot;OK, I spent so much time on X, and that was useful&quot;. For several things for Android, I have seen some things getting fixed and some permissions on the &quot;deprecation path&quot;. What is also thanks to my work? I guess so? I would pay big bucks to know it was. Again, it is not about bragging, it's about knowing that my work did have value. I found this aspect quite frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the industry side, I would expect that I would feel my work to be more directly useful, even if my name will not be there when the thing goes public (if it ever goes public). And again, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last: I have been told there is a lot of BS in industry as well, and I think (?) I'm ready to deal with it. If industry manages to win against some BS I've seen for some European proposals or Reviewer #2 madness, wow, &quot;Respect&quot;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts-on-taking-big-decisions&quot;&gt;Final thoughts on taking big decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to make the tone of this blog post &quot;light&quot;... but it was a tough decision and I had some rough years while figuring these things out. The trickiest point for me was the feeling of getting stuck and overwhelmed by the SO many orthogonal aspects to balance when taking such a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time trying to figure out which specific combination of them would have been my ideal one. I think that's a good exercise, but my suggestion is to be more pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of exploring the full combinatorial space of possibilities, the vast majority of which are only available in an ideal world, I suggest you to start from some concrete instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I would suggest: 1) list the aspects for which you are not very flexible; 2) list the aspects that are important but for which you are flexible, and the ones that are very minor points; 3) look around and try to find &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; possibilities. That is, instead of exploring the entire combinatorial space, try to find 3/4/5/6 reasonable candidates: it will be much easier to choose &quot;just among them&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing you can do is to read about other people's experiences. The good news is that there are a lot of resources on the topic, and some of them are really helpful and offer in-depth perspective. If I need to pick one, I would suggest you to check the blog posts from Matt Welsh. Many of the things he wrote ringed very true, and I envied him when he found the guts to leave his tenured position at Harvard (!!!). These are some of his interesting blog posts (among many others): &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2010/05/secret-lives-of-professors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Secret Lives of Professors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-im-leaving-harvard.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why I'm Leaving Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-fame-trap.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Fame Trap&lt;/a&gt;. I somehow felt he was right when I was reading about these things many years ago, but I wanted to try this prof job myself... and it turns out he was definitively right on many things... I guess lesson learnt: always trust the advice of a prof, infinite wisdom FTW! :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But kidding apart, it's very difficult to take these decisions especially because you don't have much data about them. So, my general advice is: are you in doubt? Do you think you may like it? GO AND TRY! If I could go back to 3 years ago, I would totally and surely do it again. Unless you are absolute sure that, for example, you hate teaching, nobody can really tell you if you would be a good fit. Worst case, you can quit after few years. Really, nothing is forever...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck for your decisions, and enjoy the journey! ... and as &quot;the dude&quot; would say, take it easy :-)&lt;/p&gt;
