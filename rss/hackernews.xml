<title>Give Me Back My Monolith</title>
<link>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It feels like we’re starting to pass the peak of the hype cycle of microservices. It’s no longer multiple times a week we now see a blog post of “How I migrated my monolith to 150 services”. Now I often hear a bit more of the counter: “I don’t hate my monolith, I just care that things stay performant”. We’ve actually seen some migrations from &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/&quot;&gt;micro-services back to a monolith&lt;/a&gt;. When you go from one large application to multiple smaller services there are a number of new things you have to tackle, here is a rundown of all the things that were simple that you now get to re-visit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup went from intro chem to quantum mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up a basic database and my application with a background process was a pretty defined process. I’d have the readme on Github, and often in an hour or maybe a few I’d be up and running when I started on a new project. Onboarding a new engineering, at least for an initial environment would be done in the first day. As we ventured into micro-services onboarding time skyrocketed. Yes, we have docker and orchestration such as K8s these days to help, but the time from start to up and running a K8s cluster just to onboard a new engineer is orders of magnitude larger than we saw a few years ago. For many junior engineers this is a burden that really is unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So long for understanding our systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets stay on the junior engineer perspective for just a moment. Back when we had monolithic apps if you had an error you had a clear stacktrace to see where it originated from and could jump right in and debug. Now we have a service that talks to another service, that queues something on a message bus, that another service processes, and then we have an error. We have to piece together all of these pieces to eventually learn that service a was on version 11 and service q was expecting vesion 12 already. This in contrast to my standard consolidated log, and lets not forget my interactive terminal/debugger for when I wanted to go step by step through the process. Debugging and understanding is now inherintly more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If we can’t debug them, maybe we can test them&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration and continuous development is now starting to become common place. Most new apps I see now days automatically build and run their tests with a new PR and require tests to pass and review before check-in. These are great processes to have in place and have been a big shift for a lot of companies. But now to really test my service I have to bring up a complete working version of my application. Remember back to onboarding that new engineer with their 150 service K8s cluster? Well now we get to teach our CI system how to bring up all those systems to actually test that things are working. That is probably a bit too much effort so we’re just going to test each piece in isolation, I’m sure our specs were good enough that APIs are clean and service failure is isolated and won’t impact others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All the trade-offs are for a good reason. Right?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons to migrate to micro-services. I’ve heard cases for more agility, for scaling your teams, for performance, to give you a more resilient service. The reality we’ve invested decades into development practices and tooling around monoliths that are still maturing. In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/product/cloud&quot;&gt;day to day&lt;/a&gt; I work with a lot of folks from all different stacks. Usually we’re talking about scaling because they’re running into limits of a single node Postgres database. Most of our conversation focuses on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/06/28/scaling-from-one-to-one-hundred-thousand-tenants/&quot;&gt;scaling the database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in all the conversations I’m fascinated to learn about their architecture. Where are they in their journey to micro-services. It has been an interesting trend to see more and more reactions “We’re happy with our monolithic app.” The road to micro-services may work fine for lots, and the benefits may outweigh the bumpy road to get there, but personally give me my monolithic app and a beach somewhere and I’ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. to ground Boeing 737 Max 8</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/us-bans-boeing-737-max-8-after-ethiopian-airline-lion-air-crashes-2019-3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/us-bans-boeing-737-max-8-after-ethiopian-airline-lion-air-crashes-2019-3</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The United States on Wednesday joined Canada, the European Union, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-airlines-ban-boeing-737-max-8-airspace-2019-3&quot;&gt;several other countries and airlines&lt;/a&gt; in banning the Boeing 737 Max aircraft from its airspace following Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump said he would issue an order to ground all 737 Max aircraft, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;We're going to be ordering an emergency order to ground all 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Several US lawmakers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/lawmakers-urge-faa-ground-boeing-737-max-8s-after-deadly-ethiopian-lion-air-crashes-2019-3&quot;&gt;called for grounding the plane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a statement, Boeing said it recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration that the 737 Max be grounded &quot;out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wednesday's decision marked an about-face for the FAA, which had said as late as Tuesday evening &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/faa-says-no-basis-ground-boeing-737-max-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that it saw no reason to ground&lt;/a&gt; the 737 Max aircraft operating in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are 371 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in operation around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The US is the last major operator of the 737 Max to ground the aircraft type. China, which has the most Max aircraft, grounded its fleet on Monday. The Europe Union on Tuesday banned the plane from its airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-that-fly-the-boeing-737-max-2018-11&quot;&gt;2 Boeing 737 Max airliners have crashed since October — here are the airlines that fly the plane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 737 Max's major US customers include Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and United Airlines. Southwest is the 737 Max 8's largest customer, with 34 planes in its fleet. American operates 24 of the aircraft, while United flies 14 of the larger 737 Max 9 variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Earlier today the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) informed us that based on new information, they are grounding the United States Boeing 737 MAX fleet out of an abundance of caution,&quot; American Airlines said in a statement to Business Insider. &quot;Our teams will be working to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Southwest and United were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;A United Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;United Airlines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/ethiopian-airline-flight-to-nairobi-crashes-passengers-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302&lt;/a&gt; crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport on Sunday, killing all 157 passengers and crew members on board the four-month-old plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was the second nearly brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 airliner involved in a fatal crash in recent months. In October, Lion Air Flight JT610 crashed in the Java Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-receive-updated-control-software-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boeing announced it would roll out an updated version&lt;/a&gt; of the 737 Max's control software in the coming weeks. It said the update has been in the works since the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the implementation of the software &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-ethiopian-crash-government-shutdown-delayed-plane-software-fix-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;was delayed by the 35-day government shutdown&lt;/a&gt; from late December to January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Ethiopian police officers walk past the debris of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plane crash, near the town of Bishoftu, near Addis Ababa. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the heart of the controversy surrounding the 737 Max is its Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;To fit the Max's larger, more fuel-efficient engines, Boeing had to redesign the way it mounts engines on the 737. This change disrupted the plane's center of gravity and caused the Max to tend to tip its nose upward during flight, increasing the likelihood of a stall. The system is designed to automatically counteract that tendency and point the nose down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Initial reports from the Lion Air investigation indicated that a faulty sensor reading may have triggered the system shortly after takeoff. Observers fear that a similar thing happened during the Ethiopian Airlines flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Boeing 737 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-boeing-737-max-plane-became-best-seller-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is the best-selling airliner of all time&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1965, the American aviation giant has taken orders for a whopping 15,000 737s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the years, Boeing has introduced four distinct generations of the 737, the latest being the 737 Max that entered service in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Boeing has orders for roughly 5,000 737 Max jets, making it the fastest-selling plane in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;The cockpit of a 737 Max. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Boeing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Boeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-profit-moodys-2019-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lists the 737 Max 8 at $121.6 million&lt;/a&gt;. But according to industry research from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tealgroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Teal Group&lt;/a&gt;, buyers usually receive a discount of 50% to 55% on the planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 737 Max is built alongside the previous-generation 737NG (Boeing 737-600, -700, -800, and -900) at Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the end of last year, Boeing had ramped up production of the 737 to 52 aircraft a month. It said it planned to produce 57 a month this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last year, Boeing delivered 256 Max aircraft to customers, representing nearly half of all 737 deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the company's airliner division, has a backlog of 5,870 planes — including 4,699 737s — valued at more than $400 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;video-desc&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Facebook platform users hit Twitter with #facebookdown Wednesday, after losing access to Facebook, Instagram and Messenger across the world. &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Wochit, USA TODAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;Having trouble accessing Facebook or Instagram on Wednesday afternoon? You weren't alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;The massively popular social network started having problems at around noon Eastern time, with issues popping up across Facebook proper, Facebook Messenger and Instagram around the world. The service outage is one of the longest Facebook has ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;As of publication, service had not yet been fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Roland Dobbins, an engineer with network performance firm Netscout said the outage was due to an accidental traffic jam issue with a European internet company that collided with Facebook and other websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;While not malicious in nature, such events can prove disruptive on a widespread basis,&quot; he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Some users of Facebook-owned WhatsApp reported having issues sending photos on the popular messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;As with nearly every Facebook outage, users headed to Twitter with the hashtag #facebookdown quickly becoming the top trending topic in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;It is not immediately clear what caused Wednesday's issue.

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;We’re aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. &quot;We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In a tweet at 3:03 p.m. ET, the company reiterated that it is still working on a fix. Facebook also confirmed that the outage was not the result of any distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cookie Warning Shenanigans Have Got to Stop</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This will be short, ranty and to the point: these warnings are getting ridiculous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-08-at-09.08.45.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, tell you something you don't know! The whole ugly issue reared its head again on the weekend courtesy of the story in this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.5433526011561&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m not sure if this makes it better or worse... “Cookie walls don't comply with GDPR, says Dutch DPA”: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/p0koRdGrDB&quot;&gt;https://t.co/p0koRdGrDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1104153598458396672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I don't know if it makes it better or worse is that on the one hand, it's ridiculous that in a part of the world that's more privacy-focused than most it essentially boils down to &quot;take this cookie or no access for you&quot; whilst on the other hand, the Dutch DPA somehow thinks that this makes any sense to (almost) anyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Dutch DPA’s guidance makes it clear internet visitors must be asked for permission in advance for any tracking software to be placed — such as third-party tracking cookies; tracking pixels; and browser fingerprinting tech — and that that permission must be freely obtained. Ergo, a free choice must be offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; what we want? To continue chucking up cookie warnings to everyone and somehow expecting them to make an informed decision about the risks they present? 99% of people are going to click through them anyway (note: this is a purely fabricated figure based on the common-sense assumption that people will generally click through anything that gets in the way of perming the task they set out to complete in the first place). And honestly, how on earth is your average person going to make an informed decision on a message like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.3404255319149&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm sure its a good article though... It might have been nice to read it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/95bpDtmjDO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/95bpDtmjDO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Paul Court (@MrPCourt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrPCourt/status/1104156453349277697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how hard it is to explain OAuth to technical people, let alone the masses? Oh wait - it's not OAuth - it's Oath but even I didn't get that at first because nobody really reads these warnings anyway! And now that I have read it and I know it's Oath, what does that really mean? Oh look, a big blue button that will make it all go away and allow me to do what I came here for in the first place...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But say you are more privacy focused and you wanted to follow that link in the original tweet. Here's your fix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're smart enough to actually understand what cookies are and be able to make an &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt; decision when prompted with a warning like TechCrunch's, then you're smart enough to know how to right click on a link and open it incognito. Or run an ad blocker. Or something like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/mmm-pi-hole/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you move to Australia because apparently, we don't deserve the same levels or privacy down here. Or have I got that back to front and Europeans don't deserve the same slick UX experience as we get down here? You know, the one where you click on a link to read an article and you actually get to read the article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's be European for a moment and see how that experience looks - let's VPN into Amsterdam and try to control my privacy on TechCrunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/2019-03-09_10-35-44.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you fucking serious? This is what privacy looks like? That's 224 different ad networks that are considered &quot;IAB Partners&quot; (that'd be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iab.com/&quot;&gt;Interactive Advertising Bureau&lt;/a&gt;) and I can control which individual ones can set cookies. And that's in addition to the 10 Oath foundational partners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't disable any of those either by the look of it so yeah, no privacy on that front. But at least you can go and read their privacy policy, right? Sure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://unruly.co/privacy/#privacy-policy&quot;&gt;Unruly's&lt;/a&gt; is 3,967 words, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/policy.php&quot;&gt;Facebook's&lt;/a&gt; is 4,498 words and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zentrick.com/privacy-policy/&quot;&gt;Zentrick's&lt;/a&gt; is another 3,805 words. Oh - and remember that you need to accept cookies on each one of those sites too and you're going to want to read about how they and their partners track you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-2.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the ridiculous thing about it is that tracking isn't entirely dependent on cookies anyway (and yes, I know the Dutch situation touched on browser fingerprinting in general too). Want to see a perfect example? Have a go of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amiunique.org/&quot;&gt;Am I Unique&lt;/a&gt; and you'll almost certainly be told that &quot;Yes! You can be tracked!&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-3.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over one million samples collected and yet somehow, I am a unique snowflake that can be identified across requests without a cookie in sight. How? Because even though I'm running the current version of Chrome on the current version of Windows, less than 0.1% of people have the same user agent string as me. Less than 0.1% of people also have their language settings the same as mine. Keep combining these unique attributes and you have a very unique fingerprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-5.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list goes on &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; beyond that screen grab too - time zone, screen resolution and even the way the canvas element renders on the page. It's kinda cool in a kinda creepy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the bit that really bugs me (ok, it all bugs me but this is the worst): how do we expect your normal everyday person to differentiate between cookie warnings and warnings like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-6.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/03/image-7.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know what these are and you probably do too by virtue of being on this blog, but do you really think most people who have been conditioned to click through the warning that's sitting between them and the content they wish to read understand the difference between this and a cookie warning? We literally have &lt;em&gt;banks&lt;/em&gt; telling people just to ignore these warnings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.7840375586854&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;German bank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/comdirect?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@comdirect&lt;/a&gt; recommends to just ignore the warning about an insecure connection in their online banking app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable... &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@troyhunt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ROOol70OyB&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ROOol70OyB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— der JayJay (@jayjay_92) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayjay_92/status/1067056789420720129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, everyone clicks through cookie warnings anyway, if you read them you either can't understand what they're saying or the configuration of privacy settings is a nightmare, depending on where you are in the world you either don't get privacy or you don't get UX hell, if you understand the privacy risks then it's easy to open links incognito or use an ad blocker, you can still be tracked anyway and finally, the whole thing is just conditioning people to make bad security choices. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dwarf Fortress is coming to Steam with graphics</title>
<link>https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263905/dwarf-fortress-steam-graphics-workshop</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263905/dwarf-fortress-steam-graphics-workshop</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;7aMwXp&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;, the famously complex and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/23/5926447/dwarf-fortress-will-crush-your-cpu-because-creating-history-is-hard&quot;&gt;often inscrutable&lt;/a&gt; colony simulation, is coming to Steam and itch.io. The new version will be published by Kitfox Games, a Montreal-based independent studio, and will include graphics, music, sounds, and Steam Workshop integration. An ASCII-based mode will still be available in this new version, and development of the original game will continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cXeuBM&quot;&gt;Also known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/game/slaves-to-armok-god-of-blood-chapter-2-dwarf-fortress/6954&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter 2: Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the game has been in development since 2003 by the two-man team of Tarn Adams and Zach Adams, aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/&quot;&gt;Bay 12 Games&lt;/a&gt;. The elaborate simulation has three different modes. In Fortress Mode, players guide a small band of dwarves into creating a settlement from scratch. Meanwhile, Adventure Mode plays like a classic roguelike dungeon crawler. Legends Mode allows players to create an elaborate procedurally generated world and then inspect it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bar9g6&quot;&gt;All three modes record player actions, meaning that you can explore your own deserted settlements in Adventure Mode, or read about the exploits of the city you helped to create in Legends Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;b3G70D&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;lSPwZF&quot;&gt;The new, premium edition of &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; will include actual graphics for the first time. Traditionally, the game has only offered ASCII-style icons. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xwhi1KKp5QD9R4-euZ0JqRB0vHdNPqdBJXjIgp-yYHA/edit&quot;&gt;an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; published alongside today’s announcement, the graphics will be handled by Michał “Mayday” Madej and Patrick Martin “Meph” Schroeder, two well-regarded members of the game’s modding community. Another community member, who goes by the handle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dabuaudio.com/&quot;&gt;Dabu&lt;/a&gt;, will be handling a musical score inspired by the seasons and select bits of audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i0XNGQ&quot;&gt;Steam Workshop integration may be the biggest selling point here. Fans have made many mods to supplement the core &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; experience. One of the most popular, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=168411.0&quot;&gt;Dwarf Therapist&lt;/a&gt;, allows you to troubleshoot individual dwarves, digging down into their wants and needs and even controlling them in ways the base game simply doesn’t allow. Many consider Dwarf Therapist and other mods essential to the gameplay experience, and Steam Workshop support will make accessing them easier than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;gRlEiv&quot;&gt;In today’s FAQ, Bay 12 stressed that &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; isn’t being changed to make it “fit” into Steam or itch.io. It will be the exact same experience plus a few modern quality-of-life features. Kitfox said that it has “no access to the source code, and will have no influence on the design, programming, or updates to &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6ObztK&quot;&gt;Virtually the same game, minus these new features, will still be available for free at the Bay 12 website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qvLuml&quot;&gt;“Steam/itch.io and Kitfox will get cuts of the sales on those platforms,” states the FAQ, “so if you want to give MAXIMUM money to Tarn and Zach, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12games.com/support.html&quot;&gt;direct donation&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hm5Hzu&quot;&gt;Traditionally, &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; has only been available as a free download direct from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/&quot;&gt;the Bay 12 website&lt;/a&gt;. The Adams brothers say they’ve been offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/2/4486794/dwarf-fortress-creators-offered-six-figures-for-publishing-rights&quot;&gt;large sums of money in the past for licensing deals&lt;/a&gt;, but the team has always subsisted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/24/5931277/download-the-dwarf-fortress-soundtrack-and-rock-out-in-ascii&quot;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt; alone. It even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/1/8529495/dwarf-fortress-patreon&quot;&gt;made the move to Patreon in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But, in today’s FAQ, the pair said that they’re selling this premium version in part to pay for health care for ailing family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UKZey9&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; is going premium because we want more people to encounter the game, grow the community,” Bay 12 wrote in the statement, and because “some of the creator’s close family members have developed serious health issues within the past 6 months, and money to support them is tight. As it’s a sensitive and difficult matter, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; respect Tarn and Zach’s privacy about this, but keep some well wishes in your hearts for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;X0KhT0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; currently has no release date on Steam or itch.io, since, as the developers indicate, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/&quot;&gt;time is subjective&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada grounds Boeing 737 Max 8</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/garneau-boeing-ethiopia-crash-1.5054234</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/garneau-boeing-ethiopia-crash-1.5054234</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canada is grounding all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft and banning the jet from entering its airspace until further notice as safety concerns continue to mount following two deadly crashes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;This safety notice restricts commercial passenger flights from any air operator, both domestic and foreign, of the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft from arriving, departing, or overflying Canadian airspace,&quot; Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters earlier today. (The Max 9 has an extended fuselage, but uses the same systems as the Max 8s).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canada had been one of the last holdouts on temporarily banning the Max 8s in the wake of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 people on board, including 18 Canadians. The U.K., the European Union, Australia and other countries had moved already to ban the jet from their airspace in response to growing safety concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;similarLinks&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;similarListItem&quot;&gt;&lt;span/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;labelText label-cbc-in-ethiopia&quot;&gt;CBC in Ethiopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;similarLinkText&quot;&gt;Grief and anger as families try to identify loved ones killed in Ethiopia Airlines crash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garneau said the decision to issue the safety notice was made after his department received new data suggesting a similarity between the Ethiopian Airlines crash and another deadly crash near Indonesia in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister said much of the new information is new and unproven, but added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are — and I hasten to say not conclusive — but there are similarities that sort of exceed a certain threshold in our minds with respect to the possible cause of what happened in Ethiopia&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My departmental officials continue to monitor the situation and I will not hesitate to take swift action should we discover any additional safety issues,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. follows suit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump issued an &quot;emergency order&quot; grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 a few hours after Canada's decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reacting to U.S. decision to ground Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 jets &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcGarneau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;@MarcGarneau&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; says &quot;It was always a possibility, but the fact that they announced it just after us came as a bit of a surprise.&quot; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&amp;amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;#cdnpoli&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OAS2IvARrq&quot;&amp;gt;pic.twitter.com/OAS2IvARrq&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot;&gt;Garneau&lt;/span&gt; said Canada alerted the U.S. to the safety notice on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reuters, the Federal Aviation Administration held urgent meetings on the issue after Canada announced it would become the latest major country to ground the jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, Garneau directly contacted his counterpart, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. The source said the Americans understood Garneau's decision and did not try to persuade Ottawa to change its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was always a possibility, but the fact that they announced it just after us came as a bit of a surprise,&quot; said Garneau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Transport Minister Marc Garneau discusses the decision to ground Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft, after Canada had been one of the last holdouts. 9:09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Canada, which already had cancelled multiple scheduled flights to and from London in response to the U.K. closing its airspace yesterday, said it's working to rebook passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Air Canada's cancellation and rebooking policies are in place with full fee waiver for affected customers,&quot; said a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are working to rebook impacted customers as soon as possible, but given the magnitude of our 737 MAX operations, which on average carry nine to twelve thousand customers per day, customers can expect delays in rebooking and in reaching Air Canada call centres.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;similarLinks&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;similarListItem&quot;&gt;&lt;span/&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;similarLinkText&quot;&gt;Boeing has grounded its 737 Max jets. Here are the kind of disruptions Canadians can expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestJet also said it will begin complying with Transport Canada's direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We respect the decision made by Transport Canada and are in the process of grounding the 13 MAX aircraft in our fleet,&quot; said the company in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This decision has an impact on the travel plans of our WestJet guests and we ask for understanding as we work to rebook all guests affected as quickly as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based &lt;span class=&quot;scayt-misspell-word&quot;&gt;Sunwing&lt;/span&gt; Airlines announced late Tuesday it would voluntarily ground its four Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft for &quot;evolving commercial reasons,&quot; such as airspace restrictions imposed by some destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union representing Air Canada's 8,500 flight attendants welcomed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In light of the new data received by the federal government, we welcome the Minister's decision to err on the side of prudence until the analysis of the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash is completed,&quot; said CUPE spokesperson Wesley Lesosky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Transport Minister Marc Garneau illustrates the similarities between the Lion Air flight crash from October 2018 to this past weekend's Ethiopian Airlines plane crash out of Addis Ababa. 1:23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Garneau said it would be &quot;premature&quot; to ground all 41 of the 737 Max 8s currently owned by Canadian air carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, shortly after the U.K. announced yesterday it is temporarily banning the jets from its airspace, Garneau tweeted that he was cancelling previous plans and meeting with his civil aviation expert panel to discuss the Max 8 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Conservatives and the NDP had been calling on the government to ground the planes as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Masse, the NDP innovation, science and economic development critic, criticized the speed of Garneau's decision Wednesday, saying &quot;it should have been made sooner&quot; given how other countries took action well before the midday Wednesday announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masse is asking Garneau to enact a &quot;contingency plan&quot; to ensure passengers who find their travel plans disrupted by the grounding of these aircraft are not &quot;gouged&quot; by airlines during the rebooking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Canadian airlines have the privilege of providing air transport to millions of Canadians and this entails comprehensive responsibilities to ensure their passengers are safe and treated fairly in the market,&quot; he wrote in a letter. &quot;Consumers should not be further victimized by predatory practices or pricing during this time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pilot reported problems: airline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday's disaster follows another fatal crash of the 737 Max 8 jet in Indonesia five months ago, which killed 189 people and raised concerns about the fleet's automated flight systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre both agree that the government should ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 jets until they can be proven to be safe. 0:55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asrat Begashaw, a spokesperson for Ethiopian Airlines, said that before the crash, the pilot reported flight-control problems and asked to return to Addis Ababa, where the flight to Nairobi originated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'black box' flight recorders from the crash site will be sent to Europe for analysis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;Transport Minister Marc Garneau announces a safety notice that restricts any commercial Boeing Max 8 or 9 jets from flying into or out of any Canadian airports, or from flying over Canadian airspace. 1:28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google has added DuckDuckGo as a search engine option for Chrome users</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/google-has-quietly-added-duckduckgo-as-a-search-engine-option-for-chrome-users-in-60-markets/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/google-has-quietly-added-duckduckgo-as-a-search-engine-option-for-chrome-users-in-60-markets/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;In an update to the chromium engine, which underpins &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google’s&lt;/a&gt; popular Chrome browser, the search giant has quietly updated the lists of default search engines it offers per market — expanding the choice of search product users can pick from in markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably it has expanded search engine lists to include pro-privacy rivals in more than 60 markets globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, which appear to have been pushed out with the Chromium 73 stable release yesterday, come at a time when Google is facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1105569803857739777&quot;&gt;rising privacy&lt;/a&gt; and antitrust scrutiny and accusations of market distorting behavior at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many governments are now actively questioning how &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/&quot;&gt;competition policy needs to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to rein in platform power and help smaller technology innovators get out from under the tech giant shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a note about the changes to chromium’s default search engine lists on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/98b2af784450beb20cdb26cbee60168891cec4ec#diff-3168db83d84c9efc4ee8e323bd0bf798&quot;&gt;GitHub instance&lt;/a&gt;, Google software engineer Orin Jaworski merely writes that the list of search engine references per country is being “completely replaced based on new usage statistics” from “recently collected data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The per country search engine choices appear to loosely line up with top-four market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest beneficiary of the update appears to be pro-privacy Google rival, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, which is now being offered as an option in more than 60 markets, per the GitHub instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously DDG was not offered as an option at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pro-privacy search rivals, French search engine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qwant.com/?l=en&quot;&gt;Qwant&lt;/a&gt;, has also been added as a new option — though only in its home market, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDG has been added in Argentina, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Bolivia, Brazil, Belize, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Germany, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, India, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Moldova, Macedonia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Portugal, Paraguay, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Switzerland, U.K., Uruguay, U.S. and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re glad that Google has recognized the importance of offering consumers a private search option,” &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/duck-duck-go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;duck-duck-go&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; founder Gabe Weinberg told us when approached for comment about the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDG has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/pro-privacy-search-engine-duckduckgo-hits-30m-daily-searches-up-50-in-a-year/&quot;&gt;growing steadily for years&lt;/a&gt;, and has also recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push/&quot;&gt;taken outside investment&lt;/a&gt; to scale its efforts to capitalize on growing international appetite for pro-privacy products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the chromium &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/github&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; instance is dated December 2018 — which appears to be around the time when Google (finally) passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/duck-com-now-points-to-duckduckgo-not-google/&quot;&gt;Duck.com domain to DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, after holding onto the domain and pointing it to Google.com for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Google for comment on the timing of its changes to search engine options in chromium. At the time of writing the search giant had not responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment on being added as an option in its home market, Qwant co-founder Eric Leandri said “thank you” to Google for adding the search engine as an option in France, claiming “certainly it’s because of the number of users of Qwant” in its home market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he added that Qwant still recommends to its users that they use &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/mozilla-streamlines-firefox-tracker-blocking-controls/&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s Firefox browser&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/brave-dow-jones/&quot;&gt;pro-privacy Brave browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said it would have been nicer if Google had also added Qwant in Germany and Italy where he said the search engine also has a following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he believes expanded search engine options in Chrome will be enough to stave off further regulatory intervention related to Google’s market dominance, Leandri said no — pointing out that Android OEMs still have to pay Google to install a non-Google search engine by default, following the European Commission’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/&quot;&gt;Android antitrust ruling&lt;/a&gt; last year, as we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/google-still-claimed-to-be-blocking-search-rivals-on-android-despite-europes-antitrust-action/&quot;&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a joke,” he added. “But thank you again for Chrome 73, I really and sincerely appreciate [it]. I still recommend Firefox and Brave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report was updated with comment from Qwant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>JIT-Less V8</title>
<link>https://v8.dev/blog/jitless</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://v8.dev/blog/jitless</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;V8 v7.4 now supports JavaScript execution without allocating executable memory at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its default configuration, V8 relies heavily on the ability to allocate and modify executable memory at runtime. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/turbofan-jit&quot;&gt;TurboFan optimizing compiler&lt;/a&gt; creates native code for hot JavaScript (JS) functions just-in-time, and most JS regular expressions are compiled down to native code by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2009/02/irregexp-google-chromes-new-regexp.html&quot;&gt;irregexp engine&lt;/a&gt;. Creating executable memory at runtime is part of what makes V8 fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in some situations it can be desirable to run V8 without allocating executable memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some platforms (e.g. iOS, smart TVs, game consoles) prohibit write access to executable memory for non-privileged applications, and it has thus been impossible to use V8 there so far; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing writes to executable memory reduces the attack surface of the application for exploits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;V8’s new JIT-less mode is intended to address these points. When V8 is started with the &lt;code&gt;--jitless&lt;/code&gt; flag, V8 runs without any runtime allocation of executable memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it work? Essentially, V8 switches into an interpreter-only mode based on our existing technology: all JS user code runs through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/ignition-interpreter&quot;&gt;Ignition interpreter&lt;/a&gt;, and regular expression pattern matching is likewise interpreted. WebAssembly is currently unsupported, but interpretation is also in the realm of possibility. V8’s builtins are still compiled to native code, but are no longer part of the managed JS heap, thanks to our recent efforts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/embedded-builtins&quot;&gt;embed them into the V8 binary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these changes allowed us to create V8’s heap without requiring executable permissions for any of its memory regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/jitless#results&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since JIT-less mode disables the optimizing compiler, it comes with a performance penalty. We looked at a variety of benchmarks to better understand how V8’s performance characteristics change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/speedometer-2&quot;&gt;Speedometer 2.0&lt;/a&gt; is intended to represent a typical web application; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/web-tooling-benchmark&quot;&gt;Web Tooling Benchmark&lt;/a&gt; includes a set of common JS developer tools; and we also include a benchmark that simulates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromeperf.appspot.com/report?sid=518c637ffa0961f965afe51d06979375467b12b87e72061598763e5a36876306&quot;&gt;browsing workflow on the Living Room YouTube app&lt;/a&gt;. All measurements were made locally on an x64 Linux desktop over 5 runs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/jitless/benchmarks.svg&quot; intrinsicsize=&quot;626x387&quot;/&gt;JIT-less vs. default V8. Scores are normalized to 100 for V8’s default configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedometer 2.0 is around 40% slower in JIT-less mode. Roughly half of the regression can be attributed to the disabled optimizing compiler. The other half is caused by the regular expression interpreter, which was originally intended as a debugging aid, and will see performance improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web Tooling Benchmark tends to spend more time in TurboFan-optimized code and thus shows a larger regression of 80% when JIT-less mode is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we measured a simulated browsing session on the Living Room YouTube app which includes both video playback and menu navigation. Here, JIT-less mode is roughly on-par and only shows a 6% slowdown in JS execution compared to a standard V8 configuration. This benchmark demonstrates how peak optimized code performance is not always correlated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/real-world-performance&quot;&gt;real-world performance&lt;/a&gt;, and in many situations embedders can maintain reasonable performance even in JIT-less mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory consumption only changed slightly, with a median of 1.7% decrease of V8’s heap size for loading a representative set of websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage embedders on restricted platforms or with special security requirements to consider V8’s new JIT-less mode, available now in V8 v7.4. As always, questions and feedback are welcome at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/v8-users&quot;&gt;v8-users&lt;/a&gt; discussion group.&lt;/p&gt;
