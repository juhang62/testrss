<title>TikTok told moderators to suppress posts by “ugly” people and the poor</title>

<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;233&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The makers of TikTok,&lt;/u&gt; the Chinese video-sharing app with hundreds of millions of users around the world, instructed moderators to suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform, according to internal documents obtained by The Intercept. These same documents show moderators were also told to censor political speech in TikTok livestreams, punishing those who harmed “national honor” or broadcast streams about “state organs such as police” with bans from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These previously unreported Chinese policy documents, along with conversations with multiple sources directly familiar with TikTok’s censorship activities, provide new details about the company’s efforts to enforce rigid constraints across its reported 800 million or so monthly users while it simultaneously attempts to bolster its image as a global paragon of self-expression and anything-goes creativity. They also show how TikTok controls content on its platform to achieve rapid growth in the mold of a Silicon Valley startup while simultaneously discouraging political dissent with the sort of heavy hand regularly seen in its home country of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On TikTok, livestreamed military movements and natural disasters, video that “defamed civil servants,” and other material that might threaten “national security” has been suppressed alongside videos showing rural poverty, slums, beer bellies, and crooked smiles. One document goes so far as to instruct moderators to scan uploads for cracked walls and “disreputable decorations” in users’ own homes — then to effectively punish these poorer TikTok users by artificially narrowing their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;244&quot; readability=&quot;53.538972387277&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil are publishing two internal TikTok moderation documents, recreated with only minor redactions, below. One lays out bans for ideologically undesirable content in livestreams, and another describes algorithmic punishments for unattractive and impoverished users. The documents appear to have been originally drafted in Chinese and later — at times awkwardly — translated into English for use in TikTok’s global offices. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Beijing-headquartered company that operates a suite of popular sites and social apps, a sort of Chinese analog to Facebook. ByteDance, founded in 2012, has come under scrutiny by the U.S. government over its ties to the Chinese Communist Party and numerous reports that the app’s censorship tactics mirror those of Beijing; Sens. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961493/tiktok-chuck-schumer-marco-rubio-recruit-army-secretary&quot;&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/11/18/the-technology-202-josh-hawley-escalates-war-with-tiktok-with-new-bill-to-limit-u-s-data-in-china/5dd17b5088e0fa10ffd20edb/&quot;&gt;Josh Hawley&lt;/a&gt; have both worked to limit TikTok’s use by government personnel, arguing that it presents a risk to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok spokesperson Josh Gartner told The Intercept that “most of” the livestream guidelines reviewed by The Intercept “are either no longer in use, or in some cases appear to never have been in place,” but would not provide specifics. Regarding the policy of suppressing videos featuring unattractive, disabled, or poor users, Gartner stated that the rules “represented an early blunt attempt at preventing bullying, but are no longer in place, and were already out of use when The Intercept obtained them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources indicated that both sets of policies were in use through at least late 2019 and that the livestream policy document was created in 2019. Gartner would not explain why a document purportedly aimed at “preventing bullying” would make zero mention of bullying, nor why it offers an explicit justification of attracting users, not protecting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excluding Undesirable Users From the “For You” Fire Hose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One moderation document outlining physical features, bodily and environmental, deemed too unattractive spells out a litany of flaws that could be grounds for invisibly barring a given clip from the “For You” section of the app, where TikTok videos are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/how-tiktok-holds-our-attention&quot;&gt;funneled to a vast audience based on secret criteria&lt;/a&gt;. Although what it takes to earn a spot on the “For You” section remains a mystery, the document reveals that it took very little to be excluded, all based on the argument that uploads by unattractive, poor, or otherwise undesirable users could “decrease the short-term new user retention rate,” as stated in the document. This is of particular importance, the document stresses, for videos in which the user “is basically the only focus of the video … if the character’s appearance or the shooting environment is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;246&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this policy, TikTok moderators were explicitly told to suppress uploads from users with flaws both congenital and inevitable. “Abnormal body shape,” “ugly facial looks,” dwarfism, and “obvious beer belly,” “too many wrinkles,” “eye disorders,” and many other “low quality” traits are all enough to keep uploads out of the algorithmic fire hose. Videos in which “the shooting environment is shabby and dilapidated,” including but “not limited to … slums, rural fields” and “dilapidated housing” were also systematically hidden from new users, though “rural beautiful natural scenery could be exempted,” the document notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document, presented in both English and Chinese, advised TikTok’s moderators that for videos shot in someone’s house with “no obvious slummy charactor [sic],” special care should be given to check for slummy features such as a “crack on the wall” or “old and disreputable decorations.” The mere appearance of residential disrepair or crooked teeth in the frame, the document shows, could mean the difference between worldwide distribution and relative invisibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justification here, as with “ugly” uploaders, was again that TikTok should retain an aspirational air to attract and hold onto new users: “This kind of environment is not that suitable for new users for being less fancy and appealing.” Social startups, eager to build on their momentum rather than disappear into the app heap of history, commonly consider growth and user retention to be by far their top priority, but rarely is the public privy to the details of this kind of nakedly aggressive expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Pullquote Pullquote--right&quot; data-reactid=&quot;247&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok moderators were told to suppress users with “abnormal body shape,” “ugly facial looks,” “too many wrinkles,” or in “slums, rural fields” and “dilapidated housing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;250&quot; readability=&quot;65.824208345664&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how widespread this exclusionary practice has been. Gartner, the TikTok spokesperson, told The Intercept that “the policies mentioned appear to be the same or similar to those &lt;a href=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org/2019/discrimination-tiktok-curbed-reach-for-people-with-disabilities/&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by” German publication Netzpolitik in December in a story about how TikTok was artificially suppressing access to videos created by disabled, overweight, and LGBT users and represented an effort “at preventing bullying, but are no longer in place, and were already out of use when The Intercept obtained them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the TiKTok documents reviewed by The Intercept include a range of policies beyond those reported by Netzpolitik, involving among other things the suppression of content from poor, old, and “ugly” users. Furthermore, these documents contain no mention of any anti-bullying rationale, instead explicitly citing an entirely different justification: The need to retain new users and grow the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to its practice of strategically suppressing the unattractive, infirm, and despondent, TikTok also conducted closed-door outreach to its more popular users, one TikTok moderation source told The Intercept. “Operators who spoke directly to influencers and official content creators always make video conferences with groups to pass ‘safety rules’, thus reducing the chances of creating videos that go against what [ByteDance] think is right”, the source told us. According to this source, their office held regular video conferences between operators, a person from the “safety team,” and select TikTok “influencers” to provide advanced warning of changes to the app’s content policies, helping ensure that they wouldn’t run afoul of any new rules or prohibitions as they made their way across two billion smartphones. Gartner did not comment when asked about this outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Censoring Political Speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TikTok policies around the “For You” section had to do with suppression, that is, keeping certain content from becoming too popular, a second document obtained by The Intercept is concerned with censorship, laying out rules for outright removing content from the company’s video livestreaming feature. The rules go far beyond the usual Beijing bugbears like Tiananmen Square and Falun Gong. Crucially, these rules could be easily interpreted to proscribe essential components of political speech by classifying them as dangerous or defamatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any number of the document’s rules could be invoked to block discussion of a wide range of topics embarrassing to government authorities: “Defamation … towards civil servants, political or religious leaders” as well as towards “the families of related leaders” has been, under the policy, punishable with a terminated stream and a daylong suspension. Any broadcasts deemed by ByteDance’s moderators to be “endangering national security” or even “national honor and interests” were punished with a permanent ban, as were “uglification or distortion of local or other countries’ history,” with the “Tiananmen Square incidents” cited as only one of three real world examples. A “Personal live broadcast about state organs such as police office, military etc,” would knock your stream offline for three days, while documenting military or police activity would get you kicked off for that day (would-be protestors, take note).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Pullquote Pullquote--left&quot; data-reactid=&quot;251&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasts deemed to be endangering “national honor and interests” were punished with a permanent ban, as was “uglification of countries’ history,” including Tiananmen Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;254&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner refused to clarify whether the substance and intent of these restrictions are still in effect under different phrasing, for example, whether there is any current rule whatsoever against “harming national honor” or documenting police movements. “Like all platforms, we have policies that protect our users, and protect national security, for example banning any accounts that promote hate speech or terrorism, as outlined in our Community Standards,” Gartner wrote in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the document outlines harsh penalties for some political speech, TikTok’s treatment of racist broadcasts was milder. Streams that attempt “to shame/degrade individuals or groups on certain attributes such as disability, gender, color, sexual orientation, nationality, ethnics, beliefs” resulted in a user’s suspension for a single month. After that, the user can stream as usual. Users that disparaged TikTok via livestream were to be suspended for three days, and the ones who promote TikTok’s competitors could be banned forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;256&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other moderation documents obtained by The Intercept indicate that TikTok has influenced content on its platform not just by censoring videos and disappearing users, but by padding feeds with content from “shadow accounts” operated by company employees posing as regular users. Internal employee guidelines reviewed by The Intercept suggest that ByteDance employees scoured Instagram for popular topics, downloaded the videos, and reshared them on TikTok to maintain a steady spray of appealing content; workers tasked with populating “Nice Looking” videos on the app were encouraged to check out Instagram posts tagged with “#BeachGirl,” for example. Asked about such practices and their reflection in the guidelines, Gartner said, “we did not see that language anywhere in moderation guidelines or Trust and Safety policies after a thorough search of them” and did not respond further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as TikTok contractors seem to have been pilfering “beach girl” content, women who didn’t hew to TikTok’s invisible modesty code could have their streams terminated and their accounts banned, the livestream policy document shows. Streams depicting someone wearing bikini or swimming suits outside of a “beach or swimming occasion” were to be punished with a one-week suspension, while accounts showing the “outline of female nipples” could be closed “forever.” TikTok’s livestream modesty code even applied to the arts: “Singing or playing music pornography contents, sexual cues, etc” are forbidden, as is merely “discussing the topic of sexual reproduction” on stream — acts TikTok classifies as “voice vulgarity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;258&quot; readability=&quot;35.794392523364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is correct that for live streaming TikTok is particularly vigilant about keeping sexualized content off the platform,” Gartner wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content moderation documents obtained by The Intercept Brasil and The Intercept contain indications that standards enforced on TikTok livestreams originate in China. One document, while in English, contains clunky phrasing suggestive of machine translation, as well as references to a Chinese language font embedded in the file itself, while the second contains large portions of both Chinese and English text. The TikTok livestream policy guide details 64 possible infractions organized into 13 different categories, each corresponding to a specific penalty. The categories range from the obvious common-sense prohibitions (“Juvenile Improper Behavior”) to the prudish and baffling: TikTok users who “Give the finger on purpose over twice” will have their stream terminated and their account banned for a day, while “disrupting national unity,” left undefined, comes with a permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok’s political rules have proven controversial in the recent past. In September, the Guardian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing&quot;&gt;reported on&lt;/a&gt; similar content moderation documents that showed how TikTok “instructs its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong,” among other authoritarian-friendly censorship rules. ByteDance, eliding this confirmation of TikTok’s use to push Chinese foreign policy, acknowledged to the Guardian that “In TikTok’s early days we took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform, and our moderation guidelines allowed penalties to be given for things like content that promoted conflict, such as between religious sects or ethnic groups, spanning a number of regions around the world. … The old guidelines in question are outdated and no longer in use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;261&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public “Guidelines,” Secret Rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many TikTok rule breakers will likely never receive a satisfying explanation for their punishment, because the existence and contents of the fine-grained rules have been kept out of public view. TikTok holds its users accountable to secret policies that, as on other digital platforms, attempt to dictate what is impermissible and how offending users are to be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind a typical social network’s public-facing generic “Community Guidelines” are actual rules, sprawling documents that give moderators nuts and bolts instructions on what to delete and what to keep. Precariously employed tech company moderators themselves are typically as excluded from the rule-making process as the users are, receiving policy updates from on high abruptly and with little rationale to help them with their Sisyphean enforcement gigs. Gartner told The Intercept that TikTok’s moderation staff is “a combination” of staff employees and contractors, and that “Over the past year, we have established Trust and Safety hubs in California, Dublin and Singapore, which oversee development and execution of our moderation policies and are headed by industry experts with extensive experience in these areas.” Gartner did not address why the documents viewed by The Intercept were originally composed in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple TikTok sources, who spoke with The Intercept on the condition of anonymity because they feared professional and legal reprisal, emphasized the primacy of ByteDance’s Beijing HQ over the global TikTok operation, explaining that their ever-shifting decisions about what’s censored and what’s boosted are dictated by Chinese staff, whose policy declarations are then filtered around TikTok’s 12 global offices, translated into rough English, finally settling into a muddle of Beijing authoritarianism crossed with the usual Silicon Valley prudishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok’s livestream feature is still being rolled out to the app’s global user base, who will have only the company’s publicized Community Guidelines to consult on the subject of what’s allowed and what isn’t. This anodyne “guidelines” page is a mix of vague boundaries and boilerplate marketing (“TikTok’s mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. … We remove all expressions of abuse. … We do not allow sexually explicit or gratifying content on TikTok”) too compressed to entertain nuance. TikTok’s community guidelines also omit any signs that the content policies obtained by The Intercept — used behind the scenes by the service’s invisible moderator teams — have threatened free political expression and provided for the censorship of large swaths of the world’s population based on genetics, economics, and arbitrary decency standards. The matter of who decides what ugliness means for hundreds of millions of people in cultures around the world, what “disreputable” decor might mean, or how many wrinkles are considered “too many wrinkles” remain glaringly open and unaddressed, even in the internal moderator documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, TikTok fans must continue to rely on the Community Guidelines page to guide their conduct, while the actual rules remain always on the verge of revision, revocation — or disavowal via corporate statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Senate leadership pushing a surveillance bill as Americans focused on Covid-19</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/senate-short-term-extension-spy-programs-132401</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/senate-short-term-extension-spy-programs-132401</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Senators were under intense pressure to clear the legislative docket to allow for the chamber to quickly take up a bill intended to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to send a final version to the Senate as early as Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Lee and Paul, for their part, vehemently oppose the House’s FISA bill, contending that it does not go far enough to reform law enforcement’s surveillance authority. But they said they would be willing to back a temporary extension of the provisions if Senate GOP leaders allow amendment votes on the House bill, which passed in the lower chamber last week with a bipartisan majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate,” Paul told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Other senators indicated earlier Monday that they would support a temporary extension of the FISA powers out of concern that a prolonged lapse would hinder the U.S. intelligence community’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“If the alternative is staying dark, I’ll take an extension,” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;McConnell did not address the negotiations on Monday afternoon, only saying the House bill was the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“It reauthorizes the tools, which our national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” McConnell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“The Senate should not wait to act,” McConnell added. “I sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Last week, Lee attempted numerous times to secure unanimous consent for a short-term extension, with an agreement to vote on four amendments to the House-passed bill at a later date. But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) objected to Lee’s requests, saying it was unnecessary to drag out a debate over the FISA provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Lee also spoke with President Donald Trump earlier that day and said the president told him he did not support the House bill. However, House Republicans indicated late last week that Trump does, in fact, support the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Three key FISA provisions lapsed on Sunday night after the Senate failed to reauthorize them before the deadline. The House bill addressed bipartisan concerns about possible overreach by the surveillance courts and ended an already deactivated National Security Agency program that allowed the organization to obtain, with judicial approval, Americans’ phone records in terror investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The legislation strengthened privacy statutes and placed new restrictions on the FISA courts — inspired in part by Trump’s frequent complaints about his former campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was wiretapped as part of the U.S. government’s initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marianne LeVine and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States continues to experience its longest economic expansion since World War II, concern is growing that soaring corporate debt will make the economy susceptible to a contraction that could get out of control. The root cause of this concern is the trillions of dollars that major U.S. corporations have spent on open-market repurchases (aka “stock buybacks”) since the financial crisis a decade ago. In 2018 alone, with corporate profits bolstered by the &lt;em&gt;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act&lt;/em&gt; of 2017, companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index did a combined $806 billion in buybacks, about $200 billion more than the previous record set in 2007. When companies do these buybacks, they deprive themselves of the liquidity that might help them cope when sales and profits decline in an economic downturn. Making matters worse, the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017, according to JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;172.54618473896&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-768x432.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_07_690423314-850x478.jpg 850w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-249772&quot;/&gt; HBR Staff/Daniel Sambraus/Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States continues to experience its longest economic expansion since World War II, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-november-financial-stability-report-borrowing.htm&quot;&gt;concern is growing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/07/25/u-s-corporate-debt-continues-to-rise-as-do-problem-leveraged-loans/#2796aad53596&quot;&gt;soaring corporate debt&lt;/a&gt; will make the economy susceptible to a contraction that could get out of control. The root cause of this concern is the trillions of dollars that major U.S. corporations have spent on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/opinion/ban-stock-buybacks.html&quot;&gt;open-market repurchases&lt;/a&gt; — aka “stock buybacks” — since the financial crisis a decade ago. In 2018 alone, with corporate profits bolstered by the &lt;em&gt;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act&lt;/em&gt; of 2017, companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index did a combined $806 billion in buybacks, about $200 billion more than the previous record set in 2007. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yardeni.com/pub/buybackdiv.pdf&quot;&gt;$370 billion&lt;/a&gt; in repurchases which these companies did in the first half of 2019 is on pace for total annual buybacks that are second only to 2018. When companies do these buybacks, they deprive themselves of the liquidity that might help them cope when sales and profits decline in an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-27/debt-financed-share-buybacks-dwindle-to-lowest-level-since-2009&quot;&gt;according to JPMorgan Chase&lt;/a&gt;. The International Monetary Fund’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2019/10/01/global-financial-stability-report-october-2019&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Financial Stability Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, issued in October, highlights “debt-funded payouts” as a form of financial risk-taking by U.S. companies that “can considerably weaken a firm’s credit quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can make sense for a company to leverage retained earnings with debt to finance investment in productive capabilities that may eventually yield product revenues and corporate profits. Taking on debt to finance buybacks, however, is bad management, given that no revenue-generating investments are made that can allow the company to pay off the debt. In addition to plant and equipment, a company needs to invest in expanding the knowledge and skills of its employees, and it needs to reward them for their contributions to the company’s productivity. These investments in the company’s knowledge base fuel innovations in products and processes that enable it to gain and sustain an advantage over other firms in its industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment in the knowledge base that makes a company competitive goes far beyond R&amp;amp;D expenditures. In fact, in 2018, only 43% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index recorded &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; R&amp;amp;D expenses, with just 38 companies accounting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/financialization-us-pharma-industry&quot;&gt;75%&lt;/a&gt; of the R&amp;amp;D spending of all 500 companies. Whether or not a firm spends on R&amp;amp;D, all companies have to invest broadly and deeply in the productive capabilities of their employees in order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/oracle-shows-buybacks-can-go-too-far.html&quot;&gt;to remain competitive&lt;/a&gt; in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock buybacks made as open-market repurchases make no contribution to the productive capabilities of the firm. Indeed, these distributions to shareholders, which generally come on top of dividends, disrupt the growth dynamic that links the productivity and pay of the labor force. &lt;a href=&quot;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/predatory-value-extraction-9780198846772?view=Grid&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;cc=gb&quot;&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; are increased income inequity, employment instability, and anemic productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buybacks’ drain on corporate treasuries has been massive. The 465 companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index in January 2019 that were publicly listed between 2009 and 2018 spent, over that decade, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/financialization-us-pharma-industry&quot;&gt;$4.3 trillion on buybacks&lt;/a&gt;, equal to 52% of net income, and another $3.3 trillion on dividends, an additional 39% of net income. In 2018 alone, even with after-tax profits at record levels because of the Republican tax cuts, buybacks by S&amp;amp;P 500 companies reached an astounding 68% of net income, with dividends absorbing another 41%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have U.S. companies done these massive buybacks? With the majority of their compensation coming from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/research-papers/the-value-extracting-ceo-how-executive-stock-based-pay-undermines-investment-in-productive-capabilities&quot;&gt;stock options and stock awards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RI_Corporate-Insiders-use-Stock-Buybacks-for-Personal-Gain_Working-Paper-201910.pdf&quot;&gt;senior corporate executives&lt;/a&gt; have used open-market repurchases to manipulate their companies’ stock prices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/secs-jackson-says-research-hes-conducted-shows-corporate-insiders-are-using-buybacks-to-cash-out-2019-03-06&quot;&gt;to their own benefit&lt;/a&gt; and that of others who are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/what-we-learn-about-inequality-from-carl-icahns-2-billion-apple-no-brainer&quot;&gt;business of timing&lt;/a&gt; the buying and selling of publicly listed shares. Buybacks enrich these opportunistic &lt;a href=&quot;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/predatory-value-extraction-9780198846772?view=Grid&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;cc=gb&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;share sellers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — investment bankers and hedge-fund managers as well as senior corporate executives — at the expense of employees, as well as continuing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to buybacks, dividends provide a yield to all shareholders for, as the name says, &lt;em&gt;holding&lt;/em&gt; shares. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isigrowth.eu/2017/06/15/share-repurchases-in-europe-a-value-extraction-analysis/&quot;&gt;Excessive dividend payouts&lt;/a&gt;, however, can undercut investment in productive capabilities in the same way that buybacks can. Those intent on holding a company’s shares should therefore want it to restrict dividend payments to amounts that do not impair reinvestment in the capabilities necessary to sustain the corporation as a going concern. With the company plowing back profits into well-managed productive investments, its shareholders should be able to reap capital gains if and when they decide to sell their shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock buybacks done as open-market repurchases emerged as a major use of corporate funds in the mid-1980s after the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/the-1-trillion-question-new-approaches-to-regulating-stock-buybacks-2/&quot;&gt;Rule 10b-18&lt;/a&gt;, which gives corporate executives a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/research/stock-buybacks-from-retain-and-reinvest-to-downsize-and-distribute/&quot;&gt;safe harbor&lt;/a&gt; against stock-price manipulation charges that otherwise might have applied. As a mode of distributing corporate cash to shareholders, buybacks surpassed dividends in 1997, helping to elevate stock prices in the internet boom. Since then, buybacks, which are much more volatile than dividends, have dominated distributions to shareholders when the stock market is booming, as companies have repurchased stock at high prices in a competition to boost their share prices even more. As shown in the exhibit “Buying When Prices Are High,” major companies have continued to do buybacks in boom periods when stock prices have been high, rendering these businesses more financially fragile in subsequent downturns when abundant profits disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase has constructed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-27/debt-financed-share-buybacks-dwindle-to-lowest-level-since-2009&quot;&gt;a time series&lt;/a&gt; for 1997 through 2018 that estimates the percentage of buybacks by S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have been debt-financed, increasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedalesreport.com/business/till-corporate-debt-do-us-apart/&quot;&gt;financial fragility&lt;/a&gt; of companies. In general, the percentage of buybacks that have been funded by borrowed money has been far higher in stock-market booms than in busts, as companies have competed with one another to boost their stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, however, as stock buybacks by companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index spiked to more than $800 billion for the year, the proportion that were financed by debt plunged to about 14% in the last quarter. Why was there a sharp decline in 2018, when the dollar volume of buybacks far surpassed the previous peak years of 2007, 2014, and 2015?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is clear: Corporate tax breaks contained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-change-business-taxes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 2017 provided the corporate cash for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-year-after-their-tax-cuts-how-have-corporations-spent-the-windfall/2018/12/14/e966d98e-fd73-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html&quot;&gt;vastly increased level of buybacks&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. First, there was a permanent cut from 35% to 21% in the tax rate on corporate profits earned in the United States. Second, going forward, the 2017 law permanently freed foreign profits of U.S.-based corporations from U.S. taxation (Under the Act, the U.S. Treasury has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/us-corporations-repatriation-of-offshore-profits-20190806.htm&quot;&gt;reclaiming some tax revenue&lt;/a&gt; lost because of a tax concession dating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salon.com/2011/08/18/global_tax_dodgers/&quot;&gt;back to 1960&lt;/a&gt; that had enabled U.S.-based corporations to defer payment of U.S. taxes on their foreign profits until repatriating them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#2&quot;&gt;2018 compared with 2017&lt;/a&gt;, corporate tax revenues declined to $205 billion from $297 billion, hypothetically increasing the financial capacity of U.S.-based corporations to do as much as $92 billion more in buybacks in 2018 without taking on debt. Given that from 2017 to 2018 stock buybacks by S&amp;amp;P 500 companies increased by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yardeni.com/pub/buybackdiv.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;$287 billion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (from $519 billion to $806 billion), the reality is that, through the corporate tax cuts, the federal government essentially funded $92 billion in buybacks by issuing debt and printing money to replace the lost corporate tax revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the total federal government deficit increased by $114 billion (from $665 billion in 2017 to $779 billion in 2018), we can (again hypothetically) think of $92 billion of this additional government debt as taxpaying households’ gift to business corporations to enable them to do even more buybacks debt-free, shifting the debt burden of stock buybacks from corporations to taxpayers. If, as a “transfer payment,” we add $92 billion to the $150 billion in debt that, according to the JPMorgan data, S&amp;amp;P 500 companies used to fund buybacks in 2018, the percentage of their 2018 buybacks that were debt-financed rises to 30%, greater than the proportion of 29% for 2017. But because of corporate tax cuts, in 2018 taxpaying households were burdened with about 38% of the combined government and business debt that enabled corporations to do buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is corporate debt or government debt that funds additional buybacks, it is the underlying problem of the corporate obsession with stock-price performance that makes U.S. households more vulnerable to the boom-and-bust economy. Debt-financed buybacks reinforce financial fragility. But it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity&quot;&gt;stock buybacks&lt;/a&gt;, however funded, that undermine the quest for equitable and stable economic growth. Buybacks done as open-market repurchases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/opinion/ban-stock-buybacks.html&quot;&gt;should be banned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chinese scientists destroyed proof of virus in December?</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;responsiveweb__Paragraph-sc-1isfdlb-0 YieBL&quot;&gt;Chinese laboratories identified a mystery virus as a highly infectious new pathogen by late December last year, but they were ordered to stop tests, destroy samples and suppress the news, a Chinese media outlet has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;responsiveweb__Paragraph-sc-1isfdlb-0 YieBL&quot;&gt;A regional health official in Wuhan, centre of the outbreak, demanded the destruction of the lab samples that established the cause of unexplained viral pneumonia on January 1. China did not acknowledge there was human-to-human transmission until more than three weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;responsiveweb__Paragraph-sc-1isfdlb-0 YieBL&quot;&gt;The detailed revelations by Caixin Global, a respected independent publication, provide the clearest evidence yet of the scale of the cover-up in the crucial early weeks when the opportunity was lost to control the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;responsiveweb__Paragraph-sc-1isfdlb-0 YieBL&quot;&gt;Censors have been rapidly deleting the report from the Chinese internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, the disgraced biotech company Theranos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/theranos-closes-deal-with-fortress-to-shut-down-embattled-firm-2018-09-13&quot;&gt;sold its patent portfolio&lt;/a&gt; to Fortress Investment Group, a division of Softbank. Now two of those patents have wound up in the hands of a little-known firm called Labrador Diagnostics—and Labrador is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.71672/gov.uscourts.ded.71672.1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;suing&lt;/a&gt; a company called BioFire Diagnostics that makes medical testing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just any medical testing equipment: BioFire recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/biomerieux-coronavirus-tests/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it had developed three tests for COVID-19 using its hardware—tests that are due out later this month. But Labrador is asking a Delaware federal court to block the company from using its technology—presumably including the new coronavirus tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stanford patent scholar Mark Lemley &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marklemley/status/1239610528533827586&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;this could be the most tone-deaf IP suit in history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Facing an avalanche of bad publicity, Labrador &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005955/en/&quot;&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it would grant royalty-free licenses to companies developing COVID-19 tests. The company also claims it didn't know that BioFire was working on a coronavirus test when it filed its lawsuit last week. The company seems to be going forward with the lawsuit.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponizing Theranos patents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the peculiarities of the patent system is that you don't have to actually prove your technology works to get a patent on it. That explains why Theranos—which was famously unable to get its technology working—managed to get a number of patents anyway. These included &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US8283155B2/en&quot;&gt;Patent #8,283,155&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Point-of-care fluidic systems and uses thereof.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This patent describes a generic architecture for a machine that automates testing for the presence of substances in bodily fluids. In the system described by the patent, an operator inserts a &quot;test device&quot; (which contains both the bodily fluid to be tested and the reactants required to perform the test) into a &quot;reader device.&quot; The reader device then triggers the necessary chemical reactions to perform the test and reports the results. Theranos' patent isn't limited to any specific bodily fluid, reactants, or testing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Theranos never got a machine like this working, BioFire did. BioFire's product line includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biofiredx.com/products/filmarray/&quot;&gt;BioFire Filmarray&lt;/a&gt;, a machine that automates detection of a variety of pathogens. BioFire says that it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/biomerieux-coronavirus-tests/&quot;&gt;added the new coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; to the slate of pathogens its devices can detect, and it expects to make this capability available to customers later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Labrador Diagnostics argues that the FilmArray infringes on two of its Theranos patents. And as is common practice in this kind of lawsuit, Labrador isn't just asking for royalties. It's also asking the court to issue an injunction against further infringement of its patents. That would apparently mean shutting down sales or use of the BioFire Filmarray product line—including its forthcoming coronavirus tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for BioFire—and for patients in need of coronavirus tests—a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay_Inc._v._MercExchange,_L.L.C.&quot;&gt;landmark 2006 Supreme Court ruling&lt;/a&gt; raised the bar for granting injunctions in patent cases. Since then, it has been fairly rare for judges to grant this kind of injunction as opposed to just awarding a winning plaintiff cash damages at the end of a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Labrador just filed its lawsuit last week. Given how slowly patent cases move through the courts, it will be many months before a judge makes even initial rulings. With luck, the coronavirus crisis will be long over before the courts rule on the merits of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON—An idea that had little traction just a few days ago—sending direct checks to Americans—is gaining fast momentum as the Trump administration came on board Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Americans need cash now, and the president wants to give cash now. And I mean now, in the next two weeks,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday at a briefing at the White House. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The...

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-Paper displays have great readability under sunlight, and only consume power when updated. But their refresh rate is limited, and most displays are fairly expensive. One way to reduce the cost is to completely remove the battery from the display, and update it through NFC providing both data and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just found out about that possibility through 4.2″ and 7.5″ displays offered by Waveshare. All you need is a compatible NFC smartphone, or the company’s &lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;ST25R3911B NFC Board to power the display and transfer your image of choice. This works best for signs you may need to infrequently update such as menus, daily schedules, conference badges, labels, etc…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been tested successfully with various NFC phones including various models from Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google Pixel, LG, Xiaomi, and others. But as long as your phone supports NFC, and delivers &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enough power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the display it should work with any phone. Once the image or processed photo is loaded on the display it will show for weeks until you update the image. The process to update the is demonstrated in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bypthrKnra0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to smartphones, Waveshare also provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ST25R3911B_NFC_Board&quot;&gt;ST25R3911B NFC board&lt;/a&gt; based on STM32F103R microcontroller and equipped with an OLED display, user buttons, and a MicroSD card socket where you’d put the image to load to the display. It can deliver 1.4 Watt of power. Note the image must be prepared for use on e-Paper display using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_Floyd-Steinberg&quot;&gt;Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in photo editing software like Photoshop or Gimp.&lt;/p&gt;
