&lt;p&gt;There is no public content about this change, but if you are logged in you can view this page and opt out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/account-settings/privacy-and-sharing/data-use&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.airbnb.com/account-settings/privacy-and-sharing/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  Project Lighthouse

  If you leave this setting turned on, you’re helping us identify and prevent discrimination from happening on Airbnb—and you’re taking part in an initiative to better understand how and where discrimination happens on platforms like ours.

  If you turn this setting off, we won’t use your information, and we’ll remove it from future studies. You can change your mind at any time.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The bit about being opted in was hidden towards the bottom of the email. Feels wrong.&lt;/td&gt;

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A group of European digital advertising associations on Friday criticized Apple Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AAPL.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O&quot;&gt;AAPL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) plans to require apps to seek additional permission from users before tracking them across other apps and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple last week disclosed features in its forthcoming operating system for iPhones and iPads that will require apps to show a pop-up screen before they enable a form of tracking commonly needed to show personalized ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen marketing associations, some of which are backed by Facebook Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_FB.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/companies/FB.O&quot;&gt;FB.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and Alphabet Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_GOOGL.O_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Google, faulted Apple for not adhering to an ad-industry system for seeking user consent under European privacy rules. Apps will now need to ask for permission twice, increasing the risk users will refuse, the associations argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Google are the largest among thousands of companies that track online consumers to pick up on their habits and interests and serve them relevant ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said the new feature was aimed at giving users greater transparency over how their information is being used. In training sessions at a developer conference last week, Apple showed that developers can present any number of additional screens beforehand to explain why permission is needed before triggering its pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pop-up says an app “would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies” and gives the app developer several lines below the main text to explain why the permission is sought. It is not required until an app seeks access to a numeric identifier that can be used for tracking, and apps only need to secure permission once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of European marketing firms said the pop-up warning and the limited ability to customize it still carries “a high risk of user refusal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple engineers also said last week the company will bolster a free Apple-made tool that uses anonymous, aggregated data to measure whether advertising campaigns are working and that will not trigger the pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s engineered to not track users, there’s no need to request permission to track,” Brandon Van Ryswyk, an Apple privacy engineer, said in a video session explaining the measurement tool to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;40db&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap improves every day. Its unparalleled global coverage — from roads and rivers to pharmacies, forests, and much more — makes OpenStreetMap a vital resource for building high-quality visual maps and navigation services for every part of the world. And OpenStreetMap data is unlocking details at a scale previously impossible, examining block by block what street networks say about every city in the world. Three recent research projects are stand-out examples of how OpenStreetMap data enables global-scale analysis to inform how we plan and experience urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ab88&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gg gy&quot;&gt;Million Neighborhoods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3de4&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://miurban.uchicago.edu/2019/11/14/millionneighborhoodsmap/&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Chicago’s Mansueto Institute&lt;/a&gt; built &lt;a href=&quot;https://millionneighborhoods.org/&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Million Neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; to identify informal settlements, or slums. These neighborhoods are typically dense and severely underserved by roads, power, water, sanitation, and other infrastructure that we all depend on in our daily lives. Slums are typically areas that are hard to get in and out of, compounding the challenges residents of these neighborhoods face. To draw attention to this, the researchers used every building in OpenStreetMap, and calculated just how difficult it was for slum residents to reach the main road network, visualizing the results using colors to highlight the least accessible areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1f3a&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://millionneighborhoods.org/#12.47/-1.27361/36.80897&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; is a city I know well, and Million Neighborhoods successfully identifies its informal settlements by this method, visualized as red in the map above. However, the analysis also exposes a limitation (and opportunity) of this approach: a dependency on comprehensive coverage in OpenStreetMap. While roads are fully covered in Nairobi, one area called Mathare does not have building footprints in OpenStreetMap, and is therefore not highlighted on the map at all. Good reason to keep mapping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5a5d&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gg gy&quot;&gt;SprawlMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cul-de-sacs, loops, and huge blocks are the street pattern typical of urban sprawl, design choices that result in an under-connected and car-focused road network. This in turn drives dependency on automobiles, increased CO2 emissions, and social isolation. SprawlMap analyzed street network patterns from OpenStreetMap globally to evaluate their level of disconnectedness, and then complemented that analysis with other data on the geographic expansion of urban areas over the past 30 years. The results highlight a worrying trend: sprawl is accelerating and spreading to new cities across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a019&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;The high- quality road network data available through OpenStreetMap has opened up the ability for researchers to perform this type of analysis in nearly every urban setting in the world.

The city follows a typical urban pattern consisting of a dense, well-connected downtown core (the blue area near the western coast) with poorly connected residential sprawl (in purple and red shades) expanding out to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

They examine where the street network is dense, compact, and walkable (including car-free areas), and combine those scores with proximity to essential amenities, like schools and medical facilities (from OpenStreetMap data), and access to public transportation (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtfs.org/&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open data transit schedules&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;04cd&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;Interestingly, both urban centers and informal settlements can score well using this methodology, as seen in the green highlighted areas of both the downtown and Soweto township in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidtaylorreich.com/wp-content/uploads/pedsfirstdemo.html#12.04/-26.20614/27.98266&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Johannesburg, South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that smarter planning, to both reduce sprawl and provide better services to established dense settlements, downtown or informal, could make cities more livable for people across society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;54fc&quot; class=&quot;ge gf as gg b gh gi gj gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw di eh&quot;&gt;This analysis is similar to well-known services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/about.shtml&quot; class=&quot;co fs hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Walk Score&lt;/a&gt;, typically found on real estate sites in the US and Europe, but because the analysis is powered by globally available OpenStreetMap data it can be applied to every city in the world. Like Million Neighborhoods, Pedestrians First also helps identify where OpenStreetMap can improve coverage of things like schools and healthcare points of interest which are not mapped as comprehensively as the road network.&lt;/p&gt;

They also told us everything made by human hands is bound to end in ruin and decay. Both themes were inspired by the rediscovery and renewed fascination for the arts of antiquity in Europe and Egypt. It was a time of renewed appreciation for monumental works of art, which happened to coincide with a period when they came under considerable threat from looters, vandals, and invading armies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One work of art that appeared on the itinerary of every Grand Touring aristocrat, Leonardo’s da Vinci’s fresco &lt;em&gt;The Last Supper&lt;/em&gt; in Milan, was made especially vulnerable when the refectory in which it was painted became an armory and stable for Napoleon’s troops in 1796. The soldiers scratched out the apostles’ eyes and lobbed rocks at the painting. Later, in 1800, Goethe wrote of the room flooding with two feet of water, and the building was also used as a prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-1078726 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/06/28233909/last-supper-2-e1593490542680.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;460&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every curator and conservationist knows well, grand ideas about art gloss over important details. Art is bound to particular cultures, histories and materials. One of Leonardo’s most influential frescoes during the Renaissance, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jpisbouts/the-fresco-that-never-was-5f2e77528338&quot;&gt;almost completely melted right after he finished it&lt;/a&gt;, due to his insistence on using oils, which he also mixed with tempera in &lt;em&gt;The Last Supper&lt;/em&gt;. Just a few decades after that painting's completion, one Italian writer would describe it as “blurred and colorless compared with what I remember of it when I saw it as a boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical decay is one thing. Recent fires at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2018/12/take-a-virtual-tour-of-brazils-national-museum-its-artifacts.html&quot;&gt;Brazil’s National Museum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2019/04/how-digital-scans-of-notre-dame-can-help-architects-rebuild-the-burned-cathedral.html&quot;&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; served as stark reminders that accidents and poor planning can rob the world of cherished cultural treasures all at once. Institutions have been digitizing their collections with as much detail and precision as possible. For their part, &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/story/explore-the-last-supper/sAKCB2AzvHUmKQ&quot;&gt;England’s Royal Academy of Arts has partnered with Google Arts &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/a&gt; to render several of their most prized works online, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/story/explore-the-last-supper/sAKCB2AzvHUmKQ&quot;&gt;a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Last Supper&lt;/em&gt; on canvas&lt;/a&gt;, made by Leonardo’s students from his original work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-1078727 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn8.openculture.com/2020/06/28233918/last-supper-3-e1593490571756.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;462&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than any other contemporary description of the painting, this faithful copy, probably made by artists who worked on the fresco itself, provides art historians “key insights into the long-faded masterwork in Milan,” and lets us see the vivid shades that awed its first viewers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/story/explore-the-last-supper/sAKCB2AzvHUmKQ&quot;&gt;Presented in “Gigapixel clarity,”&lt;/a&gt; notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/royal-academy-google-arts-and-culture-1888340&quot;&gt;Artnet&lt;/a&gt;, the huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/story/explore-the-last-supper/sAKCB2AzvHUmKQ&quot;&gt;digital image&lt;/a&gt; with its “ultra high resolution” was “made possible by a proprietary Google camera.” As you zoom in to the tiniest details, facts appear about the painting and its larger, more battered original in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is either a “miracle” that &lt;em&gt;The Last Supper&lt;/em&gt; has survived, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/last-supper-leonardo-da-vinci-2017-3&quot;&gt;Áine Cain writes at Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, or the result of an “unending fight” to preserve the work, as Kevin Wong details at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-25-the-last-supper-eataly-conservation-project-art-restoration.html&quot;&gt;Endgadget&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe some mysterious mixture of chance and near-heroic effort. But what has survived is not what Leonardo painted, but rather the best reconstruction to emerge from centuries of destruction and restoration. Get closer than anyone ever could to &lt;a href=&quot;https://artsandculture.google.com/story/explore-the-last-supper/sAKCB2AzvHUmKQ&quot;&gt;a facsimile of the original&lt;/a&gt; and see details from Leonardo’s work that have left no other trace in history.

<title>EU safety agency suspends Pakistani airlines&amp;#039; European authorisation</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-airlines-eu/eu-safety-agency-suspends-pakistani-airlines-european-authorisation-for-six-months-idUSKBN2412MT</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-airlines-eu/eu-safety-agency-suspends-pakistani-airlines-european-authorisation-for-six-months-idUSKBN2412MT</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has suspended Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) authorisation to fly to the bloc for six months, the airline said on Tuesday, a blow to the carrier’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the safety agency said it took the action because of concerns about Pakistan’s ability to ensure compliance with international aviation standards at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension follows Pakistan’s grounding of 262 of the country’s 860 pilots, including 141 of PIA’s 434, whose licences the aviation minister termed “dubious”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EASA has temporarily suspended PIA’s authorization to operate to the EU member states for a period of six months effective July 1, 2020 with the right to appeal,” PIA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIA said it would temporarily discontinue all its flights to Europe but later said it received a two-day relief with landing permission in Europe and Britain granted from July 1 to July 3. PIA is also allowed over flying until further order, the national flag carrier’s spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming the move in an emailed statement, the EASA referred to a recent investigation by Pakistan which it said showed a “large share” of pilot licences to be invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s grounding of the pilots followed a preliminary report on a PIA crash in Karachi that killed 97 people last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIA said it is in contact with the EASA to take corrective measures and appeal against the decision with the expectation of the “earliest possible” lifting of the suspension after action by the government and the airline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EASA also suspended the authorisation of another Pakistani airline, Vision Air International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision Air International did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the EASA’s decision, the UK Civil Aviation Authority said it, too, was withdrawing PIA’s permit to operate from three of its airports, as required under law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PIA flights from Birmingham, London Heathrow and Manchester airports are suspended with immediate effect,” a spokesman for the UK authority told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three were major flying destinations for the airline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pakistani pilots and their union, the Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association (PALPA), say there are discrepancies in the government’s list of pilots with licences deemed dubious and are demanding a judicial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIA and private airline Air Blue have also queried the list with PIA saying 36 of its pilots mentioned had either retired or left the airline, while Air Blue said it no longer employed seven of nine pilots on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It contains names of highly educated and qualified pilots who have passed all the tests,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want a fair and impartial resolution to this matter,” said PALPA’s president Chaudhry Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan aviation ministry official Abdul Sattar Khokhar said it did not have full details of the discrepancies and “the issue is being sorted out in consultation with airlines and civil aviation authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;ea54&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;This begins as a story about drag queens, but I promise it’s headed to a place that will make sense. I have been a fan of the show &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;RuPaul’s Drag Race&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since its first season in 2009. If you don’t know it, it’s a reality show where drag queens compete to be America’s next drag superstar. I watch primarily with my two gay male friends and am active on the subreddit. I’m a bisexual woman myself, not that it should matter because identity politics censor and divide people. But we’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ce28&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I noticed about three years ago that the conversation surrounding the show on social media… changed. It got angrier, more PC, more woke, and more out of touch with normalcy. People started directing lots of hate towards the queens, often based on how the show was edited that week; people getting a villain edit on the show got real life hatred on social media. People started angrily demanding that RuPaul allow trans women to compete on the show, or cisgender women competing as drag kings, or basically anyone identifying as anything and wanting to dress up as anything, and that his refusal to do so made him transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the “love” for RuPaul
&lt;p id=&quot;0aff&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Keep in mind we’re talking about RuPaul here: RuPaul Charles, unquestionably one of the most effective and most important gay rights &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/08/24/rupauls-drag-race-is-more-than-a-tv-show-its-a-movement/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; in history; someone who put drag on the map, destigmatized it, and made it mainstream. A black, gay man, a business owner, and an executive producer. It’s his show: he has a formula, the formula is for cisgender men to dress as women, the formula has worked for 17 seasons, and he’s stated he’s not changing it. Personally, I think adding trans performers would breathe life into &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Drag Race&lt;/em&gt;. But I’m a viewer, and I don’t get to decide that. The point is that &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;RuPaul’s Drag Race&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;RuPaul’s show,&lt;/em&gt; and we don’t get to scream and cry and throw tantrums until he changes his own show. Drag performers don’t have a constitutional right to appear on RuPaul’s show; they can perform everywhere else. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boulet_Brothers%27_Dragula&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;The Boulet Bros. Dragula&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, allows anyone of any gender identity or expression to compete, and &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Dragula&lt;/em&gt; rocks. The entitlement required to think you deserve to benefit from someone else’s work by forcibly inserting yourself into it — while loudly criticizing it — is stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8484&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;This shift in the drag community was odd. And it started to affect the show itself, whereby its contestants realized that the public’s condemnation would be swift and severe if they came off badly. Almost all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D25oQNFzlo&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;real interpersonal drama&lt;/a&gt; on the show disappeared, because everyone started being nice (and fake) to everyone else to avoid looking like a villain. People stopped expressing themselves authentically. It started becoming a race to be the most likeable, to gain the most social media followers, or to possibly win the crown by being the least problematic contestant. Needless to say, the show has taken a dive. It won a bunch of Emmys and it’s become mainstream, but at a cost. We still watch it, but it’s &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;RuPaul’s Best Friends Race&lt;/em&gt; now. RIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;24c6&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;From that point on, almost every conversation I’d see publicly about this show felt more and more disconnected from reality. I recently saw a livid post where fans tried to destroy Gigi Goode, a drag queen from a recent season, calling her a “tonedeaf queer of privilege” for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/gbf3l1/gigi_with_the_unwell_britney_jokes/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;tweeting a side by side pic&lt;/a&gt; of her on the show in a scene where she was wearing a bald cap next to the famous photo of Britney Spears having her shaved head meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;f66c&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;This is an iconic pop culture moment for everyone, but especially for the queer community. Gigi made some innocuous comment about how they were twins. And people were &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt; for her for this. It astounded me. I didn’t even get why. I had to dig to see that the “problem” was — and I’m still not totally sure I have it right — that Britney may have been having some mental health issues at that time, and therefore it’s bigoted to poke any fun whatsoever at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8b65&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I was like, let me get this straight: drag queens are no longer allowed to make reference to celebrities? Drag queens are the definition of counter-culture: they’re standup comedians, people on the fringe of society, who make controversy part of their shows. And now they can’t make light-hearted references, let alone to legendary, extremely well-known celebrity freakouts? Apparently the same goes for comedians, who are getting canceled left and right for “problematic” punchlines, regardless of when they made them or what the context was. Welcome to 2020, a world where you could never make &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; movie, &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Animal House&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Sixteen Candles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Blazing Saddles&lt;/em&gt;…although I’m sure that 100% politically correct and inoffensive comedies will be just as good as these classics 🤦🏻‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;87db&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;During this period, I’d basically sworn off politics. I got my law degree in 2010, immediately started working in startups, moved to Boston, and focused on work. I only filtered in tech news; politics seemed overly negative and click-baity and a waste of mental energy. My only major areas of concern were privacy and free speech, given that I worked at a privacy startup. I view those two as opposite sides of the same coin: when our privacy is violated or undefined, when we feel we’re being watched, we censor ourselves. Tracking and surveillance have chilling effects on freedom of speech, freedom of association, self-expression, and other celebrated, protected activities. We aren’t ourselves when we think others are watching, and we don’t speak freely. And even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abine.com/blog/2011/what-is-privacy-about/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;back then&lt;/a&gt;, I was seeing signs that a world was coming that would sift through your metadata and your old posts and likes and judge you, potentially preventing you from getting hired, getting you fired, and otherwise putting your livelihood at risk. I fought against that and saw it was a losing battle. I even got doxxed myself once on Reddit, having to delete my first account. But I was still an active member of these &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Drag Race&lt;/em&gt; communities, and I was seeing the culture shift through that lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4661&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Over the past 3 months during the quarantine, I started noticing the discourse change &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; severely. Fear crept in and made people accept what they heard from “authorites” and stop questioning messages. The things I’d been seeing that made me feel alienated and unrepresented among a show I’d been a fan of for over a decade were now everywhere on the internet. I used to see multiple views on social media; suddenly I only saw only one. It was like everyone online got a copy of the same script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2973&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;At first, the script was about COVID: “if you don’t stay home and don’t wear a mask, you are literally committing murder.” I didn’t agree with this overly simplified statement for a lot of reasons, most of all that it demands that people remain at home in potentially horrible environments. This is most applicable to poor people, who are disproportionately likely to have unsafe home environments, abusive family members, or otherwise violent and unhealthy surroundings. And yet mostly white, mostly wealthy virtue-signaling people were shaming everyone into a unified behavior, without regard for individual differences, without regard for the crushing effect on the economy, without regard for the fact that 50% of Americans have less than $1k in their savings accounts and that a forced quarantine without work would bankrupt them. The poor have borne a disproprionate amount of the inequality of this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4f6f&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Then, obviously, BLM was reinvigorated in a big way. Like pretty much every American with a soul, I was appalled by the death of George Floyd. Justice for George Floyd is a paramount goal for US society. I understood the protests. But despite his killer getting fired and arrested, the protests became more violent, more destructive, and more divisive. Suddenly it was “racist” to take the nuanced view that protests are okay but smashing businesses’ windows and walking out with big screen TVs is not, despite the former looking like activism and the latter looking like a felony. Not to mention the nearly overnight shift in The One True Message being “stay home and isolate from people or you’re the devil” to “go out and protest in large groups of people or you’re the devil.” It reminds me of 1984 and the sudden shifts in allies and enemies in war:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;ij ik il&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0fa5&quot; class=&quot;gt gu ib gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;“The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0646&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;And then came the over-the-top wave of social media bullying. If you aren’t posting #BLM, you’re racist. If you ARE posting #BLM but you say it in the wrong way, you’re racist. If you’re white and you’re silent, that’s violence. If you’re white and you’re speaking up, you’re talking over black voices and only they should be heard. If you’re white, you’re privileged and racist; your “&lt;a href=&quot;https://taibbi.substack.com/p/on-white-fragility&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;fragility&lt;/a&gt;” means you’re also racist if you deny it. If you’re one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;26.3% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are neither black nor white, do you get a say in all this? If you’re black and you disagree with any of the BLM tenets, you’re an “Uncle Tom” (their words, not mine), and “you’ve been so traumatized” through racism that you’re incapable of thinking for yourself.” I highly recommend the documentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uncletom.com&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Uncle Tom&lt;/a&gt; — featuring 100% black thinkers and advocates — if you want to learn about this phenomenon. The hate for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Candace Owens&lt;/a&gt; in particular is hard to stomach. You might not agree with her politics or enjoy her way of delivering them, but she doesn’t deserve death threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6be1&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I watched as many drag queens — a white queen in particular having the most vitriol — yelled at RuPaul for not posting anything expressly supporting the BLM movement. Again, this is despite RuPaul’s 59 years of lived advocacy on this planet. It started to feel as though image mattered more than substance, as though the bullying around failing to post or posting the wrong thing mattered more than how you’ve lived your life across decades. It’s an unwinnable situation: agree with the mob, or disagree/stay silent and get labeled a racist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHLd8de6nM&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Listen to Obama: wokeness sucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;5fbc&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Then I saw the vicious hatred that JK Rowling was getting, not for a racist comment but an allegedly transphobic one. She reacted to an article titled “Creating a more equal post-COVID world for people who menstruate.” She tweeted, “I’m sure there used to be a word for those people [….] Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?” Basically she called out that women menstruate. You’d think she tweeted that trans people deserve to die, because instantaneously there was outrage everywhere I looked. She responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;writing this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;a534&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I read it and found it well-researched and poignant. For example, one of her points is that some trans rights activists maintain the position that lesbians are bigots if they have a preference for dating a woman without a penis. Yes, just let that sink in: it’s transphobic to prefer that your female lover not come equipped with a penis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c58e&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I thought this was nuts, because obviously there is a biological difference between the sexes. All &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2020/06/07/jk-rowling-is-right-sex-is-real-and-it-is-not-a-spectrum/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;reasonable people know this&lt;/a&gt;. This is what allows people to transition: you’re going from one state to another. This is also why you never see people up in arms about trans men threatening fair competition in most sports. I’m not here to argue this fact because &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1218680/the-science-of-sex-differences-is-nothing-for-feminists-to-be-afraid-of/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;evolutionary biologists have done it&lt;/a&gt; countless times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e40c&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;This issue is not like society’s slow adoption of racial equality or gay rights, where older generations were stubborn in their conservatism and got aged out in their social beliefs. Those were &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;beliefs.&lt;/em&gt; We are talking about established science here, and all you accomplish when you — the mob — scream “transphobe” at people is push them underground where they don’t publicly voice their acknowledgement of these scientific facts. They do not change their minds or go away; they are still the majority of the population. And frankly you’re making trans people look like irrational bullies, when most are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ae47&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Gender identity and expression is a spectrum, biological sex is real, &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; trans people exist and deserve equal rights and protections. All three of these statements coexist simultaneously and none should threaten the other. Plenty of trans people stand up and acknowledge these scientific facts and don’t agree that the existence of biological sex differences invalidates them, people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BuckAngel/status/1274934431145275392&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Buck Angel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyzZ3J6IG6s&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Blaire White&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. These people have done their research, made up their minds, and are now standing by their positions and are not afraid to express them. They shouldn’t feel afraid to talk, and you shouldn’t feel personally attacked by what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e81&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;But none of that appeared to matter regarding JK Rowling, because hordes of trans rights activists (most of whom aren’t trans themselves, by the way), had labeled her a modern-day Hitler. That includes most of the drag queens I love and follow via &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Drag Race&lt;/em&gt;, who have vehemently blasted their hatred for her, as well all the child actors from the Harry Potter movies, who’d have nowhere near the success they have today without her stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;df92&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;We should pause here to talk about the ever-evolving rules of speech based on identity, or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prageru.com/video/what-is-intersectionality/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;intersectionality&lt;/a&gt;,” where the more “victimized” you are by society, the more you’re allowed to talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;ij ik il&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9cb2&quot; class=&quot;gt gu ib gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Intersectionality is a form of identity politics in which the value of your opinion depends on how many victim groups you belong to. At the bottom of the totem pole is the person everybody loves to hate — the straight, white male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e09&quot; class=&quot;gt gu ib gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;And who’s at the top? Well, it’s very hard to say, because new groups claim victim status all the time. No one can keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c476&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Not only is it impossible to track or apply logic to — e.g., I’m a bisexual white woman, so do I have more speaking privileges than a straight black woman on LGBTQ issues? Less? — but it constantly draws attention to the characteristics that make people different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3a13&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I’m often the only woman on company boards, and the &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing I want people thinking about in those meetings is how I’m the only woman there. It’d be terrible to preface every comment I make with “well, as a woman in tech, here’s what I think.” Let me speak for myself, not for all other women. Judge me as a human being by my contributions, please. Intersectionality is a clownish social policy that prevents any meaningful discourse because the issues at stake affect everyone; everyone needs to pitch in and be able to discuss them. It’s &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; racist to assume that everyone in an identity group has the same opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7a33&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Intersectionality creates a lot of lopsided exceptions to its own rules, too. Take the concept of cultural appropriation. Assuming a positive context, of course, wearing an outfit inspired by another culture used to be considered an homage. It drew attention to different groups of people and their unique styles. But today, beware of wearing anything outside your own culture lest you commit the sin of “cultural appropriation.” The line between celebration and appropriation is invisible and moves depending on the race of the wearer. And in a country like America, better for being a cultural melting pot, who can even tell which race “owns” what? How much of a certain ethnicity do you need to have in your blood before you gain the right to make reference to it? E.g., drag queens Raja and Shuga Cain have worn Native American looks on &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Drag Race&lt;/em&gt;, although Raja (left) received complaints because she isn’t part Native American, and Shuga (right) did not because her mother is part Native American:&lt;/p&gt;

Raja on the left (no Native American ancestry); Shuga Cain on the right (mixed Native American ancestry)
&lt;p id=&quot;f808&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;Or how about the Madonna runway (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newnownext.com/rupauls-drag-race-pit-stop-recap-snatch-game/04/2017/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;season 9, episode 6&lt;/a&gt;) where four different queens opted to portray Madonna by wearing Kimonos? Is it fine because they’re portraying Madonna, and &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Madonna&lt;/em&gt; is the one who originally culturally appropriated when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAVx9RKaLPU&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;she wore kimonos&lt;/a&gt; in the first place? Or is it not fine and appropriating Japanese culture, because none of the queens wearing kimonos are Japanese? And because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;kimonos generally originated in China&lt;/a&gt; and then moved into Japan, which they’re more strongly associated with today…should have have to be Chinese to wear one?

It’s as if people don’t understand that language is a living, breathing, evolving thing. I just saw a beloved fitness influencer on Instagram do an unironic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBoH5cJFy1y/?igshid=1fuwdv1e13kmp&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;grave apology&lt;/a&gt; for releasing a line of t-shirts 5 years ago that say “feminist savage” on them. As in, “it’s savage to be a woman who’s a weightlifter and strong.” Somehow “savage” is offensive to Native Americans now, even though her post was filled with comments from actual Native Americans saying this is, in fact, stupid and they don’t find it offensive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;161b&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I’m ethnically Jewish, but it factors very little into my day-to-day life. I rarely think about it unless I see blatant anti-semitism (or my 23andMe results). But I don’t spend every day hating Germans. I’ve visited Germany and it’s a delightful country. It disgusts me when Holocaust deniers say it didn’t happen, not even because I’m Jewish, but because I’m a human being with a fucking soul who knows right from wrong. But I respect their right to have a voice, even if I completely disagree with it. &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; because I completely disagree with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7850&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I’m fighting for truly free speech, which means that everyone can say anything, so long as A), it’s not an immediate, direct call to violence, or B), it has the &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; of inciting violence (like yelling “fire” in a crowded movie theater, which causes people to freak out and stampede all over each other). This is what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;the First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; protects. Truly free speech is divorced from what you look like, where you were born, the gender you prefer to date, or the color of your skin. You shouldn’t get speaking rights based on skin-deep traits.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s Occupy Wall Street 2.0, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRCzZp1J0v0&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;as Bret Weinstein says&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been co-opted by shrill SJWs policing language and screaming about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/business/dreyers-eskimo-pie-name-change.html&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Eskimo Pies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/25/883507841/disney-announces-redesign-of-splash-mountain-after-some-call-ride-themes-racist&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Splash Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://au.sports.yahoo.com/chess-centre-stunning-racism-debate-which-piece-moves-first-012917664.html&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and Aunt Jemima being allegedly racist (despite Aunt Jemima’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/06/21/aunt-jemima-changes-quaker-oats-racial-stereotypes/3233423001/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;own family saying the opposite&lt;/a&gt;), rather than doing much that’s meaningful to improve the experiences of black people in America. You could say it looks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT2rlJe9cuU&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;less about black lives and problems plaguing that community, and more about censorship, vilifying, and fear&lt;/a&gt;. Which is unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f7d8&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;When I talk about free speech, I’d be remiss not to address the censorship that black people have received through their overrepresentation in prisons. Not only does the physical state of being in prison make it harder for their voices to be heard, but the difficulty of their lives after release also negatively impacts their ability to speak: e.g., through being denied voting rights after a felony conviction, which affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;1 in 13 black Americans&lt;/a&gt; versus 1 in 56 non-black. Legalizing most drugs, releasing prisoners with non-violent drug-related offenses, removing mandatory minimum sentencing rules, ending felony voting disenfranchisement, and incentivizing employers to hire people emerging from the prison system (rather than shun them, and make it more likely they’ll return to their former lives) would all help to amplify black voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51a1&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;I want to be extremely clear on this: of &lt;em class=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; black lives matter. Most Americans believe this wholeheartedly, despite the racist finger-pointing you’re seeing all around you. The actual racists — not those declared “racists” under these new definitions using fragility and microaggressions and unconscious bias and privilege and who’s not posting what hashtag — are scum and they’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;the minority&lt;/a&gt;. The statement “black lives matter” is easy to agree with if you’re a decent human being. The entity and the organization Black Lives Matter, however, is a different story and a different beast. Make your own interpretation of the fact that the BLM founders describe themselves as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;trained Marxists&lt;/a&gt;.” Peruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;their mission statement&lt;/a&gt;. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-leader-if-change-doesnt-happen-we-will-burn-down-this-system/&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;this video of a BLM leader&lt;/a&gt;. It’s smart marketing to cram a group that espouses radical ideas underneath a statement as impossible to disagree with as “black lives matter.” It’s about oppressed versus oppressor, the haves and the have-nots, capitalism versus socialism. I’ll discuss this in an upcoming post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6bbf&quot; class=&quot;gt gu cd gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl cv ap&quot;&gt;This has become a moral panic, a witch hunt where people point fingers at their friends, family, and co-workers to label them “racist,” the dirtiest word in America. It’s like the Cold War era, except we’re turning in racists instead of communists. Or Nazi Germany, which everyone seems to forget happened slowly and creepingly among normal citizens who turned on each other over the supposed moral high ground. Why people think this can’t happen in the US, I don’t know. But it’s happening, and I see it. Socialism kills people. People not thinking critically and blindly following others kills people. Stalin’s socialist Russia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/100-years-of-communismand-100-million-dead-1510011810&quot; class=&quot;bw fk hx hy hz ia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;killed 20 million people&lt;/a&gt;. Do we really need to run that experiment here?&lt;/p&gt;
