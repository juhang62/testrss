&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EspoTek Labrador is an open-source board that converts your PC, Raspberry Pi or Android Smartphone and into a full-featured electronics lab bench, complete with oscilloscope, signal generator and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information available at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://espotek.com/labrador&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://espotek.com/labrador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repo hosts all of the software and hardware that makes Labrador possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download binary (executable) versions of the software, go to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/releases&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is re-built automatically each time I make a change to the source code. I recommend always downloading the latest win32, osx-dmg or linux-appimage version, depending on whether you're on Windows, macOS or Linux. Raspberry Pi downloads are not currently automatically built, but an older version is provided at the link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the documentation, please visit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/wiki&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espotek/labrador/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Qt Creator to build the software interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Desktop_Interface/Labrador.pro, then Clean All -&amp;gt; Run qmake -&amp;gt; Build All.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're on Linux (including Raspberry Pi), then you can also build the software from source by cloning the repo, cd'ing to the Desktop_Interface directory then running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;qmake
make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to launch, just type &lt;code&gt;labrador&lt;/code&gt; into the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build the AVR software, I use Atmel Studio 7. Just load up the .atsln and push F7. You can use &lt;code&gt;avr-gcc&lt;/code&gt; if you don't want to install a full IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB files can be edited in KiCAD 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the main bugs from the pre-launch period have now been fixed, including synchronisation issues.&lt;br/&gt;Please open an issue if you're aware of any in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make any suggestions, or better yet, submit some code, please do so here at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions and feature requests belong on the &quot;Issues&quot; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For code submissions, look into Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People with Greater Intellectual Humility Have Superior General Knowledge</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://opensociet.org/2019/05/26/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Jarrett &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/&quot;&gt;British Psychology Society&lt;/a&gt; edited by O Society May 26, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of social media and rolling news there’s a constant pressure to be in the know, always on hand with an aperçus or two. Today &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/&quot;&gt;intellectual humility&lt;/a&gt; therefore feels more important than ever – having the insight and honesty to hold your hands up and say you’re ignorant or inexpert about an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists are responding by taking an increasing interest in intellectual humility, including investigating its consequences for learning and the thinking styles that support it. For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Positive Psychology&lt;/em&gt; a team led by Elizabeth Krumrei-Mancuso have continued this endeavour, showing, among other things, that intellectual humility correlates with superior general knowledge. This is a logical outcome because, as the researchers write, “simply put, learning requires the humility to realise one has something to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krumrei-Mancuso and her colleagues conducted five studies in all, attempting to find out more about the links between intellectual humility and knowledge acquisition; between intellectual humility and meta-knowledge (insight into one’s own knowledge); and lastly between intellectual humility and other thinking styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength and a weakness of the research is the use of two different measures of intellectual humility. Some studies involved a shorter questionnaire assessing being a “know-it-all” (through agreement or not with statements like “I know just about everything there is to know”) and intellectual openness (through agreement or not with statements like “I can learn from other people”); whereas other studies used a more recently developed, more comprehensive 22-item measure incorporating questions about cognitions, emotions and behaviours representative of intellectual humility (such as, being accepting of criticism of one’s important beliefs; being ready to change one’s mind; and respect for others’ viewpoints). This use of different measures makes for a more comprehensive, varied assessment of intellectual humility, but also impedes comparison between the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in relation to knowledge acquisition were mixed. While an online study involving 604 adults (and using the more comprehensive measure of intellectual humility) found the aforementioned link between greater intellectual humility and superior general knowledge, another involving college students (and the briefer intellectual humility questionnaire) found that those higher in intellectual humility achieved poorer grades. Perhaps the latter result arose because the higher-achieving students used their objectively higher grades to judge their intellectual ability as higher, not having had the chance yet in life to confront their intellectual fallibility (but as mentioned, the use of different measures across the studies complicates any interpretation of the mixed results).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of insight, higher scorers in intellectual humility were less likely to claim knowledge they didn’t have (the researchers tested this by assessing participants’ willingness to claim familiarity with entirely fictitious facts that they couldn’t possibly know), and they also tended to underestimate their performance on a cognitive ability test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other thinking styles and constructs that correlated with greater intellectual humility included being more inclined to reflective thinking, having more “need for cognition” (enjoying thinking hard and problem solving), greater curiosity, and open-minded thinking. More intellectual humility was also associated with less “social vigilantism”, defined as seeing other people’s beliefs as inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new findings “replicate and extend previous studies using different measures of intellectual humility”, it’s fair to say there remains a great deal we don’t yet know about intellectual humility. Perhaps most important is the lack of longitudinal research to establish causality – for instance, we don’t yet know if greater general knowledge and open-mindedness fosters intellectual humility, or if intellectual humility comes first, and promotes knowledge and curiosity. Most likely the causal associations between these constructs are complex and two-way, but at the moment, if we’re honest, we just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359&quot;&gt;Links between intellectual humility and acquiring knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/&quot;&gt;Something we could use a little more of – studies link intellectual humility with openness to other viewpoints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default reaction to encountering someone who disagrees with you is to place your fingers in your ears. We could all benefit from a dose of intellectual humility, according to the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Self and Identity&lt;/em&gt;. People with this trait are open to other viewpoints and see disagreement as an opportunity to learn. Promisingly, early findings suggest that it may be possible to foster intellectual humility relatively easily, as least over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenelle Porter and Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh created a new intellectual humility questionnaire that asks participants to rate their agreement with 9 items like “I am willing to admit if I don’t know something”. The questionnaire is based on their conception of intellectual humility as recognising your own fallibility and the value and intellectual competence of others. Find the full list of items below (the letter R at the end of a statement means that greater agreement is a sign of &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; humility):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-33081&quot; src=&quot;https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/screenshot-2018-01-22-15-25-44.png?w=845&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-01-22 15.25.44.png&quot;/&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861&quot;&gt;Porter and Schumann, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an initial study, nearly 200 students completed this questionnaire, as well as other personality measures, and then they were asked to imagine various scenarios at college that involved a classmate disagreeing with them, for example over the causes of World War I in history class, or a passage of text in English class. Finally, the students stated what they would think of the person who disagreed with them and how they would respond. A second study was similar, but this time nearly 200 more participants, recruited online, imagined a disagreement with another person over more hot-button issues, such as gun control and same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, even after accounting for the influence of many other factors such as a person’s self-esteem, narcissism, and overall agreeableness, openness and humility, the students who scored higher on intellectual humility tended to think about the person who disagreed with them in more constructive ways – for instance, believing the other person has their own unique perspective and experiences to draw on – rather than dismissing their views as due to low intelligence or lack of understanding. Moreover, those participants with greater intellectual humility were more likely to say that, given the chance, they would try to learn more about the other person’s views, rather than simply argue with them or try to change their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to how much we can read into participants’ responses to hypothetical scenarios. To test actual behaviour, Porter and Schumann turned to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website and asked nearly 200 people to complete the intellectual humility questionnaire before revealing their position on gun control or capital punishment. Next, the participants had the chance to read opinions (written by the researchers but made to look like the opinions of other survey participants) that either agreed with their stance or took the opposite view. The researchers counted the in-survey links the participants chose to click on to read the different views. Higher scorers in intellectual humility held views that were just as strong as those low in intellectual humility, but they spent a greater proportion of time reading views that were opposed to their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if we all had a little more intellectual humility? The researchers tested an intervention that they hoped would increase intellectual humility via the promotion of a “growth mindset” – that is, belief in the malleability of intelligence. It makes sense that if you see intelligence as malleable, then you will be less worried about finding out you are wrong or that you don’t know the full story. After all, with this perspective, just because you are wrong or ignorant about something doesn’t mean you are forever condemned to being stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final study showed that participants who read a popular magazine article about the malleability of intelligence (designed to foster a “growth mindset”) subsequently scored higher on intellectual humility than another group who read an article about intelligence being fixed. What’s more, those in the growth mindset condition went on to display a more positive approach when imagining dealing with someone with opposing views, and this seemed to be driven by their increased intellectual humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world in which we seem to find it harder than ever to listen to the other side, this research is welcome. On the other hand, it’s sure to attract accusations of demonstrating the obvious. For their part, the researchers claim this is the first attempt to show there is a relation between intellectual humility and openness to opposing views. Another problem is the studies relied rather too much on hypothetical scenarios and all involved participants resident in the US. Hopefully, though, this paper will serve as a launch pad for future research that will overcome these shortcomings, and discover more about the roots of intellectual humility and how to nurture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Promoting intellectual humility may offer one path to making disagreements more constructive,” the researchers concluded, “and our research suggests that teaching people a malleable view of intelligence may be one promising way to foster intellectual humility and its associated benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AdTech will continue to suck for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this are not primarily technical, but systemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on the internet for any amount of time, you’ve probably seen very poorly targeted advertising. In my experience, I see a lot of car ads. I don’t own a car. I don’t have a licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Google’s pervasive collection of my transport habits, you’d think that any ad on of Google’s properties would take this into account. However, when I have my AdBlocker disabled (gasp) the place I most consistently see car ads is on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common argument for data collection is that it gives AdTech the ability to better service consumers by showing them more relevant ads. Clearly, this is not happening to a level that is commensurate with the data collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this lack of sophistication in targeting, it might be surprising to learn that individual data is bought and sold at a prodigious rate. When a company that delivers you food wants to make a bit of money on the side, they’ll sell your mobile phone, e-mail and address details to a third party. Delivery details are often exceptionally accurate and contemporarily correct - people want that pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see on the &lt;em&gt;surface&lt;/em&gt; level how detailed and creepy the knowledge of these third parties is, by looking at their braggadocious advertising material. These quotes are pulled direct from their own materials. Since my area of knowledge is Australia, these are mostly Australia-focused companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrich your existing database with demographic, consumption or attitudinal information. Use Experian’s consumer data to infill missing information and gain additional insight into your customers. Use Lifestage to understand your customers’ family and household circumstances, or &lt;strong&gt;Children at Address to predict the likelihood of the presence of children at the address&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containing over 500 variables, segmentations and propensities, Experian’s consumer data is unique in its breadth and depth, the inclusion of a market leading demographic segmentation (Mosaic) and its ability to link offline and online data. ConsumerView is refreshed constantly, ensuring that it accurately reflects the universe of Australian consumers at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This material is, in a word, brazen. If you work in AdTech, you might be thinking right now that consumers &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be aware this is happening. If so, I’d encourage you to talk to people who don’t work in the industry, and solicit their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven’t talked about Facebook and Google yet, and that’s intentional. As explicitly noted in the Quantium brochure, Facebook has their data. It is very likely Google has it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a key motivation for many workers is their resume. Nowhere is this truer than in marketing. So ask yourself, what campaigns look good on a front-line campaign manager’s resume? Keep in mind that the cost to acquire someone can vary from medium to medium, and segment to segment. Would you prefer to say how efficient your spend was, or perhaps how large the budget you had was? I personally have found that the latter tends to win out, while the former is vague, and sometimes extremely context dependent. Unless something goes viral (which is super, super rare), marketers aren’t putting their efficiencies on their resumes - they’re putting their budgets, the cool tech or strategies they used, or how many people they converted. We’ll discuss the amount of people converted more, later. Wanting to spruik a large budget means that at a basic level, marketers have no career reason to be super focused on efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What applies to the front-line applies as well to managers, but with extra complications. At this level, people begin being able to make decisions about consultants, and tech spending. This is where things really start to get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re a marketing-degree graduate in middle management. If you’re lucky, you may have done some statistics courses. In your day-to-day, you likely don’t apply these to a great amount. You hear about this great thing called “Machine Learning” which is sweeping marketing departments. You might have read a white paper or two about it, heard about it at a conference, or been schmoozed by someone from IBM trying to sell you Watson (ugh). You decide to talk to a consultancy about it, or are referred to one by upper management, who’s been living from cocktail-to-cocktail on the consultant’s corporate AMEX for their entire career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets be real - when you’re in this position, the consultants say a lot of words to you that you don’t understand and then you say yes to a contract because the PowerPoint looks good. Not only do you get to mention your huge new budget on your resume, thanks to the huge invoice, but you also get to mention you implemented &lt;strong&gt;MACHINE LEARNING&lt;/strong&gt; at your company. But what’s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, you’ll settle on one of two bespoke solutions. You may be running a fairly straightforward e-mail or website landing campaign, and be able to A/B test your way to success. You may actually use some machine learning to determine which users will best respond to which campaigns. You’re one of the good ones. However, these projects often do one of two things: It’ll recommend a more efficient, smaller spend on a particular subset of your usual audience (now your resume looks bad because your budget is smaller :frown:) or, it’ll give you a marginal (but significant) increase in conversions (which is OK but doesn’t do much for your resume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue for a manager like you trying to organise a campaign is that &lt;em&gt;machine learning&lt;/em&gt; is difficult to understand. You’ll see that the model selected some cohort of people and you’ll ask “who are these people?” When your consultants come back saying “its complex, it relies on the sum total of these 50 different variables” you’ll probably be uneasy. If the campaign is a disaster, how can you explain your reasoning? How can you convince your campaign managers that the cohort is good? What use is your constant intuition that targeting millennials is a good idea, when the model tells you it isn’t? Best to shelve it and focus on appealing to those millennials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other, more likely, sinister and “cutting edge” end of consultancy solutions, you’ll enter the murky world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(marketing)&quot;&gt;media attribution&lt;/a&gt;. Media attribution is a measurement of whether or not a particular campaign had an effect, even if there wasn’t a deterministic link between the ad and the customer conversion. A good example of an area where this makes sense is in billboard advertising. It is pretty hard to determine whether a particular billboard ad had an effect on a conversion. In attributing sales to that billboard, you might say something along the lines of “sales in the surrounding stores went up 15%”. This is the crux of it, you can’t usually tell if a consumer saw the billboard, but you can kinda-sorta guess that the billboard had an effect. As a manager looking to fluff up your resume, taking credit for as many conversions as possible is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this begins to expose the systemic problem is when you arrive at the intersection of media attribution and the grim surveillance state we find ourselves in. As a marketer, running a cutting-edge digital display campaign it is &lt;em&gt;now possible&lt;/em&gt; to conduct media attribution on a massive scale. You can tell that the ads were rendered on millions of screens, and you can link those ad views, via cookies, or IDs or by other more nefarious methods (eg. IP-based telecom account data) to a specific customer. If the customer - having never scrolled down to the ad, or not seen it, or had their kid on the iPad when the ad appeared - then makes a purchase &lt;em&gt;even coincidentally&lt;/em&gt; the media attribution model will claim at least part of that sale. The urge to move the sliders up and down on this model, to make your resume better, is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systemic issue occurs because marketers and AdTech companies unreflectively increase surveillance and data collection in the hopes of increasing media attribution. Even the most trivial data point, the most granular site visit or location data, stored on a person-by-person basis, could conceivably be used to demonstrate that a customer &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have come into contact with one of your campaigns. Lets look at some discussion of billboard advertising, and the direction that is going, from an industry publication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilad Amitai, COO and co-founder at Ubimo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… “What we are seeing that’s been really interesting in the last year or so and what will happen even more aggressively in the next year is that many companies will allow out-of-home inventory to be indexed versus digital data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow companies that are familiar with planning and activating in a digital way to be active in an out-of home way. So today, for example, we have clients that are bringing their own first-party data and using movement and location data to index out-of-home. So this is a major trend that is happening connecting the digital and physical world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred Gonzales-Cuzan, Innovation Manager at AdMobilize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Analytics and having real-time data on the asset itself are going to be the biggest things. Right now, it’s like a tipping point. I mean we’re a company that does that. &lt;strong&gt;We provide the data: face detection, counting vehicles, getting people by demographics, things like that.&lt;/strong&gt; But having that real data so you know X amount of people saw an asset—all their demographics like age, gender, emotion and then being able to trigger advertisements for them and have actual accountability for the ads we see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Digital Out-of-Home Industry Is Reaching a Programmatic Tipping Point, Execs Say - AdWeek - October 1st, 2018&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lockwood.dev/advertising/2019/06/07/adtech-sucks.html#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very focused topic - billboard advertising attribution. However, as a manager you’ll find this kind of bragging about egregious privacy violations is rampant across all media types. And, you’ll likely think it’s good, because being able to say your campaigns resulted in more conversions is good for your resume. More surveillance of customers is better, right? If you have a theory that customers who visit retail stores then go online and purchase the products, if you’re a retail manager, you’ll want to attribute that sale to you - maybe you’ll install beacons or track the cell phones of people who enter your store, and try to match them against people that later buy online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of this attribution activity will often be a weak, half-hearted recommendation on how to change media spend - but that isn’t the main focus of the activity. Such recommendations are secondary to the true work of taking credit for as many conversions, for resume purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a managers perspective, an incredibly small subset of users are converted by digital display. You can anecdotally see that there is little emphasis on that audience - you’ll still see ads for a product long after you made the purchase of a particular product - even from the very company you purchased from! Given this pervasive data collection, it should be easy to identify who has bought products. The truth is that given the scale of the audience for digital display - often in the millions - the effort to remove a tiny segment because they purchased the product doesn’t make sense. Better targeting is often so marginal that it won’t make your resume look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest threat to Sucky AdTech is probably mass public outrage at the pervasive corporate surveillance network it has created. The second greatest, is probably motivated CEOs, boards and shareholders. So why haven’t these people done anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thought that may occur is that media attribution and abortive, expensive machine learning projects must be terrible for the bottom line - everyone outside of the marketing department must urgently want to end them! But, the issue is systemic. Media attribution actually allows marketing departments to better justify their activities to CEOs. When using probabilistic modelling and collecting massive amounts of data, analysing the actual impact of marketing on sales is difficult for anyone outside of that industry. The CMO has no incentive to really let the CEO know all the budget they have is smoke and mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since this is a pervasive industry problem, it’d look strange for a company to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do these things. There is an entire industry devoted to justifying the budget and activities of marketing organisations. Consultancies can exist with the sole purpose of creating powerpoints to impress internal managers. Those who would benefit most financially from ending the farce currently playing out in marketing organisations don’t have the knowledge or data to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this industry is ripe for disruption by some upstart tech company, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that in order to provide this disruption, the disruptor would need access to a massive amount of data. They’d need buy-in from CEOs that would have a CMO whispering in their ear, showing them consultant-formatted powerpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into this world requires a lot of co-operation from the incumbents, who have no reason to co-operate. Those companies who enter with the best intentions, offering more precise targeting and solutions to lower ad spend, will quickly find it pays more to pay lip service to those concepts. Any attempt at disruption is a scream into a howling wind. The howling wind is driven by a tornado of wasted corporate money whirling into the pockets of consultants and marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the elephants in the room, the incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Google and Facebook are built on ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies have a certain cachet of cool. When - as a marketer - you get invited to a Google office, you see all the geniuses, you get the free lunches, and the account folk smile as they shake your hand, you can be forgiven for thinking you’re part of something greater. You have access to some hidden secrets, some special exalted tech. You might think you’re working on something to make ads &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, to target customers more precisely, and at speed. But, you should always be asking yourself one question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, oh why, would a company built on ad revenue want to reduce ad spend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more cynical marketers will have some concept of this - some idea that the concept of a “viewed” digital display ad is very vague, that measuring video views can be mystical, that corporate social channels often get less engagement than your baby pictures on Facebook - but the young and the true believers can fall into this trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Google and Facebook and the other large marketing data companies probably have some very sophisticated models of purchase intent. These companies likely know exactly when someone is making the choice, and could show people the relevant ad at the precise moment when they are most susceptible to it. But, the entire business model of these companies is to increase spend on their products. Why would they tell anyone something that would reduce ad spend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double whammy of this is that they also play into the media attribution game - the more they can track customers, the more they can say a customer that converted was on their platform, when they “saw” your ad. They have every reason to collect more data, and every reason not to use it well. They want to know every device you have, every site you visit. They want your transaction history and your favourite colour and your baby pictures. And then, they mash it all up into dumb segments designed to make you, the marketer, spend the most possible. You’ll try and target fans of anime, and they’ll show your ad in front of Lithuanian songs and a tutorial on how to make gnomes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lockwood.dev/advertising/2019/06/07/adtech-sucks.html#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You’ll constantly use public transport, spend money on fuel maybe once a year (road trips), never upload a licence as a form of ID, never click on car ads, and they’ll still show you car ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies are perfectly positioned to make ads more efficient - and they have absolutely no reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit AdTech because of these thoughts. I couldn’t, in good conscience, work in an industry that I felt was actively making the world worse. Pervasive tracking is fundamentally encouraged by these systems and power structures. Tracking is bad, because even if you don’t have anything to hide now, you may find that your past activities make you a target under a future political system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done? I feel like there may be a legislative solution. I feel like GDPR is a good start. I’d love for data to be seen as a liability - something audited and discarded often to minimise risk. I also think it’d be great if companies had to notify you every time they transferred data to a third party, whether that’s uploading an audience to Facebook, or selling your pizza delivery address to Experian. I think off the back of that, the sudden public realisation at the scale of data transfers and selling would be enough to make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that if you work in AdTech you ought to think about getting out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’m generally optimistic about the state of the world, but I think AdTech sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer</title>
<link>https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Next year, I’ll be entering my 10th year of being formally employed to write code. Ten years! And besides actual employment, for nearly &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of my life, I’ve been building things on the web. I can barely remember a time in my life where I didn’t know HTML, which is kind of weird when you think about it. Some kids learn to play an instrument or dance ballet, but instead I was creating magical worlds with code in my childhood bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reflecting on this first decade of getting regularly paid money to type weird symbols into my Terminal, I wanted to take some time to share &lt;strong&gt;some of the ways my thinking shifted over the years as a developer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;For today’s junior developers&lt;/u&gt;: Maybe you’ll find something here you currently believe, and get inspired to learn more about it and why the topic is so multi-faceted. Or maybe you’ll find this post encouraging because you’re already so far ahead of where I was at your stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;For today’s senior developers&lt;/u&gt;: Maybe you can relate, and also have some funny (and humbling) stories to share about your own life lessons when you were a junior dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, &lt;strong&gt;I think junior developers are awesome&lt;/strong&gt; and just showing up to learn already takes a ton of courage. This post is about my own journey and learnings, and isn’t meant to be a generalization about how all junior devs think or behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the post and can relate a little bit &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.1964285714286&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamsapegin&quot; alt=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW&quot; alt=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt; for your feedback on this post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;absolute-truths-i-unlearned-as-a-junior-developer&quot;&gt;Absolute truths I unlearned as a junior developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-i-m-a-senior-developer&quot;&gt;1. I’m a senior developer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 19 years old when I applied for my first technical job. The position I was applying for was called “Student Webmaster”. Which is a pretty awesome job title, because you could be considered both a “student” and a “master” at the same time. Nowadays everyone wants to be an “engineer” because it sounds fancier, but if you ask me, “master” is where it’s at. Anyways, my job was to write PHP and MySQL, and maintain our Drupal website as well as building some internal tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’d been coding in my bedroom for a couple of years, I was pretty sure those years counted as “years of experience”. So when I was asked about how much experience I had writing PHP, I confidently answered, “3 or 4 years!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I knew a lot about SQL because I could do outer joins &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;😎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I googled it, 3-4 years of experience meant I should be making &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;💰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to my latest job, which I got after 5 years of “combined” student and professional experience (which I thought was the same as normal experience). Yet in that time, I basically never had my code reviewed. I deployed by ssh-ing into a server and running git pull. I’m rather sure I never had to open a Pull Request. Don’t get me wrong, I learned a ton of awesome stuff at my first two jobs, but I’d never really worked with other devs in the same codebase. And yet, I applied for a position for “Senior Frontend Engineer”, got an offer, and accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There I was, a senior developer at the ripe age of 24 years old.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean they wouldn’t have given me this job title if I wasn’t really senior, right?! Surely, my impressive experience had brought me to this point, and people should listen to me!! Already at the pinnacle of my technical career, and the youngest developer in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a boss &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;💅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all experience is created equal.&lt;/strong&gt; My experience coding in my bedroom, working as a student, working in CS research, and working at a growing startup are all valuable kinds of experience. But they aren’t all the same. Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own (or with minimal feedback) for 5 years. If your code is never reviewed by other developers, you will not learn as fast as you can – by an enormous factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why mentors are so important&lt;/strong&gt;, and the team you work with is worth so much more than a couple bucks in your paycheck. Don’t accept a junior position where you’ll be working alone, if you can help it! And don’t accept your first role (or, honestly, any role) based on salary alone. The team is where the real value is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also learned that job titles don’t “make” you anything.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s kind of like, being a CTO with a 5-person team is different than with a 50-person team or a 500-person team. The job and skills required are totally different, even if the title is identical. So just because I had a “senior” job title did not make me a senior engineer at all. Furthermore, hierarchical titles are inherently flawed, and difficult to compare cross-company. I learned it’s important not to fixate on titles, or use them as a form of external validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-everyone-writes-tests&quot;&gt;2. Everyone writes tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first half of my career, I worked in research. Specifically, I worked on an publicly-funded project for about 3 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; years, and then at a university at the NLP chair for a year and a half. I can tell you one thing: &lt;strong&gt;programming in research is completely different than programming in the industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you aren’t building applications. You’re working on algorithms or parsing data sets. Alternatively, if you are building an application, chances are your work is being publicly funded – which means it’s free for others to use and usually open-source. And when something is free, that means, for the most part, you are not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; responsible to make sure it’s always perfectly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, well, it’s free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re also not responsible to make any money or produce results, but that is an entirely different blog post ranting about being a developer in academia &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;✨&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long story short, I left academia with lots of expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations about how the industry would work. There would be automated deployment. Pull requests and code review. It was going to be glorious! Finally the &lt;a href=&quot;https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/#4-code-quality-matters-most&quot;&gt;code quality&lt;/a&gt; I had been longing for! But beyond quality code with &lt;em&gt;proper standards&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;best practices&lt;/em&gt;, I strongly believed, &lt;strong&gt;everyone in the software industry writes tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine my surprise when I showed up at my first day on the job at a startup and found no tests at all. No tests in the frontend. No tests in the backend. Just, no tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nada. Zip. Null. Undefined. NaN tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were there &lt;em&gt;no tests&lt;/em&gt;, but no one seemed to have a problem with the lack of tests! With a bit of naivety, I assumed the reason there were no tests was because people just didn’t know how to write tests for AngularJS. If I taught them how, everything would be OK and we’d start to have tests. Wrong! Long story short, years and years later, we’ve made huge progress on adding automated tests to our code, and it wasn’t as straightforward as I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not because people didn’t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to write the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d either never felt the pain of not having tests, or they’d felt the pain of having &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt; tests. Two things I’d never experienced either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loads of companies and startups have little or no tests.&lt;/strong&gt; When struggling to find product market fit, or fighting for survival, a lot of companies neglect testing early on. Even companies that look fancy, sponsoring conferences or open-sourcing code – so many still have a big, gnarly monolith with minimal tests they need your help to improve. Ask devs who aren’t trying to recruit you to tell you about the state of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No company has a perfect tech setup.&lt;/strong&gt; Every company has problems, every company has technical debt. The question is what they’re doing about it. We should have no illusions when applying for jobs that there is work to be done – or else they wouldn’t be hiring &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.&lt;/strong&gt; I came across as SUCH a know-it-all, insisting there must be tests yet having hardly any experience on what that really looked like at scale. Don’t be like me. It’s important to have principles, but also to be open and truly interested to understand other people’s experiences and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-we-re-so-far-behind-everyone-else-aka-tech-fomo&quot;&gt;3. We’re so far behind everyone else (AKA “tech FOMO”)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is closely related to the topic of unit testing. While my company didn’t have many unit tests, &lt;strong&gt;surely all the other companies did, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read so many blog posts. I watched conference talks on YouTube. I read “that orange website” all the damn time. It seemed like everyone was writing super sophisticated and high-quality applications with great performance and fancy animations, while I was just over here patching some stuff together trying to make it work in time for my deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically idolized all the other companies I was reading about, and felt disappointment that my own company and project was so behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Just because you see a conference talk about a specific technology, doesn’t mean that company is using that tech in their day to day work, or that all of their code is in perfect shape. Often people who give conference talks are presenting toy apps rather than real-world case studies, it’s important to distinguish the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with legacy is completely normal.&lt;/strong&gt; No but seriously, it’s easy to imagine that some other company doesn’t have legacy to handle. But after spending time at conferences talking to people who work at tippy top tech companies, it becomes clear that we are all in the same boat. What company DOESN’T have a huge PHP or Ruby monolith they’re trying to tame (or had to tame at some point)? Legacy code is normal, and learning to deal with it will often teach you more than building apps from scratch because you’ll be more exposed to concepts you don’t understand yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-code-quality-matters-most&quot;&gt;4. Code quality matters most&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, &lt;strong&gt;getting a code review from me could be brutal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, I was really nitpicky about coding style. MY coding style, which happened to be a modified version of the Airbnb JavaScript styleguide, but conforming to my personal tastes. Things like indendetation, formatting, naming – god forbid you did it differently than I would have. Passing a code review without at least one comment would have involved both mind-reading and winning the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine 50+ comments on your PR with all the semicolons you missed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had eyes like an eagle and this eagle wants those high-quality semicolons &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;🦅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Luckily I no longer have eagle eyes after staring at the computer for many years, so you’re all spared – #kiddingnotkidding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good enough is good enough.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a degree of diminishing returns when it comes to how “good” code needs to be. It doesn’t have to be perfectly clean to get the job done and not be a total disaster to maintain. Often code that is a little more repetitive or a tiny bit more verbose is easier for other people to understand. Also, “good code” is not the same as “code that looks like I wrote it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture is more important than nitpicking.&lt;/strong&gt; While a small line of code could be improved, the stuff that tends to cause bigger problems down the line are usually architectural. I should’ve focused more on the structure of the application than tiny bits of code early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality is important&lt;/strong&gt;, don’t get me wrong. But code quality wasn’t what I thought it was, which was things like linting and formatting or whatever style was promoted in the latest blog post I had read &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;🙈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-everything-must-be-documented&quot;&gt;5. Everything must be documented!!!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I entered my first company, it was honestly the first time I was working a lot with code other people had written. Sure, I had done it a little bit at my first job, but I never really had to come into an existing codebase and to figure out what the heck was going on. That’s because the one time that happened, I rewrote all the code instead of trying to figure out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that it was AngularJS code written by Ruby developers, or that I was a junior developer who didn’t know she was junior &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;🕵🏻‍♀️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did I handle the fact that 300 lines of unfamiliar code made me feel like I was drowning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSDOC. EVERYWHERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started commenting &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; just to try to make sense out of it. Annotations for every function I could get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned all that fancy Angular-specific JSDoc syntax. My code was always twice as long because it had so much documentation and so many comments &lt;span aria=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;👌&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation lies sometimes.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easy to think that documentation is a cure-all solution. “We need docs!” While I didn’t come to the conclusion that just because documentation is hard work, doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing at all, I learned that you have to document the right things in the right way. Over-documentation of the wrong things tends to lead to staleness, which can be just as confusing to people who are trying to fix an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt; Tests or other forms of automation are less likely to go out of sync. So instead I try to focus on writing good tests with clear language, so developers working on code I wrote are able to see how the project functions with working code. Another example is automating the installation of an application with a few comments, rather than a long and detailed installation guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-technical-debt-is-bad&quot;&gt;6. Technical debt is bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought I was neurotic from the last point, just wait until this one! For a while in my career, I thought that any code I considered “messy” was in fact &lt;em&gt;technical debt&lt;/em&gt;. Technical debt is a funny term because if you ask people to give you an example of what it is, there are so many different things that it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as someone who viewed any kind of “disorderly” code as technical debt, I immediately tried to eliminate it with the utmost rigor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally once spent a weekend manually fixing 800 linting errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how neurotic I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: This was before auto-fixing was a thing)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disorganized or messy code isn’t the same as technical debt.&lt;/strong&gt; Just because something doesn’t “feel nice” doesn’t mean it’s technical debt. Technical debt actually slows you down in some way, or makes certain kinds of changes difficult or error prone. If the code is just a little messy, it’s just a little messy. Tidying that up might not be worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having some technical debt is healthy.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes we take a shortcut because we need to borrow time, and for that we give up some of our speed in the future. Having pieces of code that are in fact “technical debt” is okay, so long as you recognize you’ll likely need to pay that debt back. If you think your codebase is free of technical debt, there is a good chance you’re over-emphasizing &lt;em&gt;polish&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;delivery&lt;/em&gt;. And boy did I do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-seniority-means-being-the-best-at-programming&quot;&gt;7. Seniority means being the best at programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having started at a rather young age to code, I’ve probably been proficient at doing for-loops for like 15+ years. Programming itself is like breathing to me. When a solution is apparent, I can just type away and the code will follow. It’s like writing a blog post or an email. I could code the solution faster than others, and typically took on the more complex projects for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I thought that was what it meant to to be a senior developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because why not? The job title is “senior developer”, not “senior communicator” or “senior project manager”. I didn’t really understand how many other skills I could possibly need to develop in order to be truly senior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-i-eventually-learned&quot;&gt;What I eventually learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming.&lt;/strong&gt; The sheer number of skills I’ve had to develop in the mean time are astronomical, compared to what I came in with. Ranging from communication and dependency management to sharing context, project management, estimation, and successfully collaborating with non-developer peers. These skills are less quantifiable and take a lot of trial and error to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everyone will become “senior” during their career.&lt;/strong&gt; Seniority is the result of many accrued years of experience. And yet, years of experience is a necessary but not sufficient condition for seniority. It also has to be the right kind of experience in which you internalized the right lessons and successfully apply those learnings for the future. Sometimes bigger lessons can take a year or more to fully manifest – that’s why years of experience still matter, even if you’re a really good coder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re all still junior in some areas.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter how much experience you have, there are still places where you don’t know much. Admitting what you don’t know is the first step to filling in that gap and getting help from people who are more experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.0877192982456&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt; – I really enjoyed this article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/&quot; alt=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On Being a Senior Engineer&lt;/a&gt; . It’s a great read if you’re grappling with what point you’re at in your journey and find yourself wondering, “What does it mean to be senior?”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python in the Windows 10 May update</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;row justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Headshot-Python-150x150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;58&quot; height=&quot;58&quot; alt=&quot;Steve Dower&quot; class=&quot;avatar avatar-58 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-58 alignnone photo&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;entry-meta&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 21st, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Windows team &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/05/21/how-to-get-the-windows-10-may-2019-update/&quot;&gt;announced the May 2019 Update for Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. In this post we’re going to look at what we, the Python team, have done to make Python easier to install on Windows by helping the community publish to the Microsoft Store and, in collaboration with Windows, adding a default “python.exe” command to help find it. You may have already heard about these on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/130/python.exe-now-shipping-with-windows-10&quot;&gt;Python Bytes&lt;/a&gt; podcast, at PyCon US, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zooba/status/1128762545790042112?s=20&quot;&gt;through Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software moves from the PC to the cloud, the browser, and the Internet of Things, development workflows are changing. While Visual Studio remains a great starting point for any workload on Windows, many developers now prefer to acquire tools individually and on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other operating systems, the platform-endorsed package manager is the traditional place to find individual tools that have been customized, reviewed, and tested for your system. On Windows we are exploring ways to provide a similar experience for developers without impacting non-developer users or infringing publishers’ ability to manage their own releases. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/&quot;&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; is one approach, offering developers consistency between their build and deployment environments. But there are other developer tools that also matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such tool is Python. Microsoft has been involved with the Python community for over twelve years, and currently employ four of the key contributors to the language and primary runtime. The growth of Python has been incredible, as it finds homes among data scientists, web developers, system administrators, and students, and roughly half of this work is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoI57uMdDD4&quot;&gt;already happening on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, Python developers on Windows find themselves facing more friction than on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing Python on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_Before-1024x399.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-7247&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_Before-1024x399.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Windows command prompt showing an error when Python cannot be found&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;225&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It’s been widely known for many years that Windows is the only mainstream operating system that does not include a Python interpreter out of the box. For many users who are never going to need it, this helps reduce the size and improve the security of the operating system. But for those of us who do need it, Python’s absence has been keenly felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you discover that you need to get Python, you are quickly faced with many choices. Will you download an installer from python.org? Or perhaps a distribution such as Anaconda? The Visual Studio installer is also an option. And which version? How will you access it after it’s been installed? You quickly find more answers than you need, and depending on your situation, any of them might be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time figuring out why someone would hit the error above and what help they need. If you’re already a Python expert with complex needs, you probably know how to install and use it. It’s much more likely that someone will hit this problem the first time they are trying to use Python. Many of the teachers we spoke to confirmed this hypothesis – students encounter this far more often than experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we made things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_StoreBanner-1024x295.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-7262 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_StoreBanner-1024x295.png&quot; alt=&quot;The header of the Python 3.7 page in the Microsoft Store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_StoreBanner-1024x295.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_StoreBanner-300x87.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_StoreBanner-768x221.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we helped the community release &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/windows.html#windows-store&quot;&gt;their distribution of Python&lt;/a&gt; to the Microsoft Store. This version of Python is fully maintained by the community, installs easily on Windows 10, and automatically makes common commands such as &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;idle&lt;/code&gt; available (as well as equivalents with version numbers &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python3.7&lt;/code&gt;, for all the commands, just like on Linux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-7248 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Windows command prompt showing that &amp;quot;python3.7&amp;quot; now launches Python and &amp;quot;pip3&amp;quot; launches pip&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After.png 1706w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After-300x132.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After-768x337.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_After-1024x449.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the May 2019 Windows Update, we are completing the picture. While Python continues to remain completely independent from the operating system, every install of Windows will include &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; commands that take you directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/p/python-37/9nj46sx7x90p?Cid=AnnounceBlog&quot;&gt;Python store page&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that the Microsoft Store package is perfect for users starting out with Python, and given our experience with and participation in the Python community we are pleased to endorse it as the default choice.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm on a new copy of Windows and I typed Python - on a machine where I don't have it - and it launched the Windows Store into an official distribution I can install in a click. WHEN did this happen. I love this.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; srcset=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_Tweet-1.png 1254w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/05/Python_Tweet-1-768x355.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We hope everyone will be as excited as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1127022451433410560?s=20&quot;&gt;Scott Hanselman was when he discovered it&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, we plan to extend similar integration to other developer tools and reduce the getting started friction. We’d love to hear your thoughts, and suggestions, so feel free to post comments here or use the Windows Feedback app.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SoftBank could bring down the house?</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hold-my-beer-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23102&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hold-my-beer-1.jpg 620w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hold-my-beer-1-86x125.jpg 86w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hold-my-beer-1-207x300.jpg 207w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re holding what has become the world’s biggest basket of profitless, often fraudulent (I’m looking at you, BABA), and insanely overvalued, illiquid securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re one man at the helm of a ¥11.6tn empire with sole discretion as to how you operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you’ve got shareholders. But the way you’ve structured the business, the term “corporate governance” is as foreign as that thing that came out of Sigourney Weaver’s stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve used “shulbit” accounting and multiple interlinked entities to jack valuations (SoftBank routinely selling assets to its Vision fund).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has allowed for a situation where YOU actually make the market and, once made, you then borrow against those valuations. Oh, and almost everything you own &lt;s&gt;burns&lt;/s&gt; torches money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1-1024x768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23108&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1-125x94.jpg 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-1.jpg 1140w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we’re talking SoftBank today is because it popped back onto investors’ radar last week when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/393ca6fa-8226-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;we learned from the FT (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;we learned from the FT&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftBank’s Vision Fund plans to borrow $4bn against its stakes in Uber and two other Silicon Valley groups, as the investment arm of the Japanese conglomerate looks to hand back cash to investors in its $100bn fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftBank has always been an anomaly to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like so many things in the markets, unless I’ve some way of actually profiting from, it there’s little point in talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why bother now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I think SoftBank is potentially the “Lehman of venture capital”. Not in the “too big to fail” bracket, but in the “bring down the house” bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has ramifications for many asset classes that we are invested in, so I think it’s worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to that FT article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realise that leveraging venture capital is batshit crazy. You’re dealing with the most illiquid of assets on this ball of dirt, which is bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real reason it’s as nutty as a AOC’s Green Deal is because it is literally a massive basket of negative cashflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that penny stocks are volatile, you ain’t ever seen bid-ask spreads on these babies. They are quite literally worth what another investor is prepared to pay for them, and given that we’re at the tail end of what has been one helluva boom in venture capital that value can change remarkably swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why Is Son-san doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is to be found in understanding how any VC exits an investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two ways VC can get liquid: a buyout or an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given that so many of the famous “unicorns” are valued at multiples that make my eyes shoot blood, there are now an ever decreasing number of companies that make suitable suitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re down to flogging this stinking pile to the folks who always get roasted, especially at the tail end of a boom: retail investors… which is why we’re seeing tech unicorns IPO-ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good strategy for VC, so long as those retail investors buy what is being sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble now is that there are early signs that the appetite for these “growth” stocks is collapsing like a teenager after a bottle of Absolut on spring break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What teenagers am I talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chart-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23101&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chart-2.png 700w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chart-2-125x61.png 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chart-2-300x146.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;Failure to launch (Lyft)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there is Uber — another gem of a company that sucks in capital, torches it, and promises to keep doing so (no, really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/uber-q1-2019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23104&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/uber-q1-2019.jpg 800w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/uber-q1-2019-125x72.jpg 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/uber-q1-2019-300x173.jpg 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/uber-q1-2019-768x442.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the bankers are figuring that the gig is probably up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Morgan Stanley, while running the Uber IPO, secretly &lt;s&gt;screwed their client&lt;/s&gt; hedged their book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21-1024x430.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23105&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21-1024x430.png 1024w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21-125x53.png 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21-300x126.png 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21-768x323.png 768w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-31-10.11.21.png 1140w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is not lost on SoftBank, who own a truckload of venture capital darlings, many of which don’t and probably won’t ever make any money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How SoftBank got here is a story as old as man itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, thanks to QE, pushing investors out the risk curve fanned the largest venture capital boom in all of history. Trust me, I know this. I built, then sold a VC firm because I could see what was happening. Clearly, I got out too early by selling 3 years ag,o but what’s that saying of Willy Waggledagger’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23107&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1.jpg 600w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-125x66.jpg 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/proxy.duckduckgo-1-300x158.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve a name for what’s now slowly taking place in the VC world. It’s called “price discovery”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I suspect this is what SoftBank’s is now so afraid of: the prospect that being a minute late can prove catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so using the valuations which are largely concocted by SoftBank themselves (since they’ve often been leading the financings of these “unicorns” and it is the last round of investment capital which is often the metric used for valuing these things), they’re looking to front run IPOs and get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what, Chris? Surely they can just collapse if they’ve made dumb investments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True. Except that they’re big. Really big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the FT point out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43-1024x734.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23109&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43-1024x734.png 1024w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43-125x90.png 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43-300x215.png 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43-768x550.png 768w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.35.43.png 1502w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55-1024x719.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23110&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55-1024x719.png 1024w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55-125x88.png 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55-300x211.png 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55-768x539.png 768w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-03-16.36.55.png 1532w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if this wasn’t bad enough, consider that this is a company as opaque as Casper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’ve got here is a gigantic entity with questionable financing arrangements that holds an isht ton of negative cashflowing assets and is loaded to the eyeballs in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall group has ¥15.7tn ($143bn) of interest-bearing debt and ¥27tn of total liabilities, far greater than its ¥11.6tn market capitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the market for their particular “niche” looks to be turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see a scary chart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm-1024x446.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-23103&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; srcset=&quot;https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm-1024x446.png 1024w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm-125x54.png 125w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm-300x131.png 300w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm-768x334.png 768w, https://3lrofj3556kl9zu0p27yma51-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-6.52.12-pm.png 1140w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;SoftBank in orange, Tesla in purple&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it above, let me make it very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire “growth” story, which is to say companies that can continuously grow market share (preferably at a loss) looks to be rolling over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the classic Ponzi scheme. You always need fresh new capital to pay off the old capital in order for the scheme to continue. When there is no fresh new money, everything reverses and folks quickly realise the value of positive cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Tesla is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masayoshi Son is 61 years old. The question is, will he lose his teeth over the next 20 years without losing his wealth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless he can dump enough assets at these insanely elevated prices, I’m going to bet on his teeth and wealth following the same path with his wealth loss preceding his teeth loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that because in every business cycle there is an excess in some sector of the market and it finally gets cleansed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still cutting my teeth with the pointy shoes in the investment banking world when I experienced first hand the tech boom and bust in the late 90’s and 2000’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we all know about the GFC, which was an excess in the housing market. That was a 2008 affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purely from a timescale perspective, we’re due around about now. We sure as hell are pretty damn pregnant. Take a look around yourself today and tell me what’s crazier than WeWork, Uber, Lyft, Alibaba, Tesla, and yes, SoftBank?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m 100% certain that this time around it’s going to be VC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this likely to happen tomorrow? Probably not, and maybe not even for some time. But it absolutely needs to be on your radar because this bad boy is a bug in search of a windshield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no bones about it, SoftBank is in dangerous territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe shareholders can get out of this alive but it looks to me like making love with a crocodile. It’d be a heck of a story to tell but only because the odds of coming out alive are so slim.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Imagine this. You're holding what has become the world's biggest basket of profitless, often fraudulent (I'm looking at you, BABA), and insanely overvalued, illiquid securities. You're one man at the helm of a ¥11.6tn empire with sole discretion as to how you operate. Sure, you've got shareholders. But the way you've structured the business, the term 'corporate governance' is as foreign as that thing that came out of Sigourney Weaver's stomach. You've used 'shulbit' accounting and multiple interlinked entities to jack valuations (SoftBank routinely selling assets to its Vision fund). All of this has allowed for a situation where YOU</og:description>

<title>Facebook plans cryptocurrency debut</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/facebook-libra-launch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/facebook-libra-launch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is finally ready to reveal details about its cryptocurrency codenamed Libra. It’s currently scheduled for a June 18th release of a white paper explaining its cryptocurrency’s basics, according to a source who says multiple investors briefed on the project by Facebook were told that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company’s Head of Financial Services &amp;amp; Payment Partnerships for Northern Europe Laura McCracken told German magazine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiwo.de/finanzen/boerse/facebook-facebook-nennt-details-fuer-eigene-kryptowaehrung-ohne-dollaranbindung/24420686.html&quot;&gt;WirtschaftsWoche&lt;/a&gt;‘s Sebastian Kirsch that the white paper would debut June 18th, and that the cryptocurrency would indeed be pegged to a basket of currencies rather than a single one like the US dollar to prevent price fluctuations. Kirsch tells me “I met Laura at Money2020 Europe in Amsterdam on Tuesday” after she watched fellow Facebook payments exec Paulette Rowe’s talk. “She told me that she wasn’t involved in what David Marcus’ [Facebook Blockchain] team was doing. But that I’d have to wait until June 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; when a whitepaper was supposed to be published to get more details.” She told him she thought the date was already a publicly known fact, which it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, yesterday TechCrunch received a request for a June 18th news embargo from one of the communications managers for Facebook’s blockchain team. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-outside-foundation-to-govern-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;The Information’s Alex Heath and Jon Victor&lt;/a&gt; also reported yesterday that Facebook’s cryptocurrency project would launch later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1837906&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png 730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-money.png?resize=50,28 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook declined to comment on any news regarding its cryptocurrency project. There is always a chance that the announcement date could fluctuate if snafus with partners or governments arise. One source says Facebook is targeting a 2020 formal launch of the cryptocurrency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut of Libra or whatever Facebook decides to call it could unlock a new era of commerce and payments for the social network. It could be used to offer low or no-fee payments between friends or remittance of earnings to familys from migrant workers abroad who are often gouged by money transfer services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidestepping credit card transaction fees could also allow Facebook’s cryptocurrency to offer a cheaper way to pay merchants for traditional ecommerce, or facilitate microtransactions for a la carte news articles or tipping of content creators. And a better understanding of who buys what or which brands or popular could aid Facebook in ad measurement, ranking, and targeting to amplify its core business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Facebook’s cryptocurrency works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know about Facebook’s blockchain project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook will likely use the Libra codename as the public facing name for its cryptocurrency, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-outside-foundation-to-govern-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;The Information&lt;/a&gt; reports won’t be called GlobalCoin as the BBC had claimed. Facebook has registed a company called Libra Networks in Switzerland for financial services, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-switzerland-payments/facebook-forms-swiss-fintech-firm-with-payments-focus-idUSKCN1SN1ZT&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. Libra could be a play on the word LIBOR, an abbreviation for the London Inter-bank Offered Rate that’s used as a benchmark interest rate for borrowing between banks. LIBOR is for banks, while Libra is meant to be for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Token:&lt;/strong&gt; The cryptocurrency will be a stablecoin — a token designed to have a stable price to prevent discrepancies and complications due to price fluctuations during a payment or negotiation process. Facebook has spoken with financial institutions regarding contributing capital to form a $1 billion basket of multiple international fiat currencies and low-risk securities that will serve as collateral to stabilize the price of the coin, The Information reports. Facebook is working with various countries to pre-approve the rollout of the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook’s cryptocurrency will be transferrable with zero fees via Facebook products including Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook is working with merchants to accept the token as payment, and may offer sign-up bonuses. The Information also reports Facebook also wants to roll out physical devices for ATMs so users can exchange traditional assets for the cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook’s blockchain project is overseen by former PayPal President and VP of Facebook Messenger David Marcus. His team includes former Instagram VP of product Kevin Weil, Facebook’s former corporate head of treasury operations Sunita Parasuraman who The Information reports will oversee the token’s treasury, and many elite engineers cherrypicked from Facebook’s ranks. They’ve been working in a dedicated part of Facebook’s headquarters off-limits to other employees to boost secrecy, though the nature of the partnerships needed for launch have led to many leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook is in talks to create an independent foundation to oversee its cryptocurrency, The Information reports. It’s asking companies to pay $10 million to operate a node that can validate transactions made with its cryptocurrency in exchange for a say in governance of the token. It’s possible that node operators could benefit financially too. By introducing a level of decentralization to the governance of the project, Facebook may be able to avoid regulation related to it holding too much power over a global currency.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I left the ad industry because of data tracking</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90359992/an-ad-tech-pioneer-on-where-our-data-economy-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/90359992/an-ad-tech-pioneer-on-where-our-data-economy-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;20.990118577075&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.1176470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/section/the-privacy-divide&quot;&gt;The Privacy Divide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a series that explores the fault lines and disparities–economic, cultural, philosophical–that have developed around digital privacy and its impact on society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a little over two years ago that I realized the ad-tech industry had gone too far. I was an executive at a global advertising company, watching a demo from a third-party data provider on how they could help with ad targeting. Their representative brazenly demonstrated how he could pull up his own personal record and share with us his income, his mortgage details, where he worked, what kind of car he drove, which political party he was likely to vote for, and his personal interests (craft beer, of course). It was everything, all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_mid_article_inject&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;66.442181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone, another startup projected a map of San Francisco with a red line tracking a real, anonymous person throughout their day. He challenged us to infer what we could about her. She left the house at 7 a.m. Went to Starbucks. Went to a school. Went to a yoga studio. Went back to the school. She was a mother with at least one child, and we knew where she lived. We knew this because this woman’s cell phone was tracking her every move. As does every other cell phone, including the one in your pocket right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked around the room that day, many of my colleagues seemed alarmed. Up until that point, the advertising industry had asked people to trust us with their data. We were about to go back on that promise. I left the ad-tech industry shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that my industry had changed. Advertising had ceased to be about connecting with consumers—it was now about finding novel ways of extracting evermore personal information from computers, phones, and smart homes. To many of the most powerful and profitable companies in the world, &lt;em&gt;we &lt;/em&gt;are the products, and the services we all use are just afterthoughts they put out to keep us hooked. And the rest of the ad industry, which depends on their data to compete, has no choice but to go along with whatever whims and changes come their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of us have come to accept that our every move is being tracked and used to manipulate what we read, what we buy, how we vote, and how we see the world. By using ‘smart’ devices, we have invited a vast network of big tech companies, advertisers, data brokers, governments, and more into our homes and pockets. These companies have been extracting our personal data without permission and making fortunes with it. And now, with every post, click, and purchase, we have become the product. I didn’t agree to that, and I bet you didn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to unwind this surveillance economy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent Pew study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/&quot;&gt;61% of Americans would like to do more to protect their privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Two-thirds have said the current laws are not good enough (REF). We need a combined political and technological solution to unwind this surveillance economy. Here’s what that should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, people must have a real choice about what data they share. If you don’t want to share personal data with a company, you shouldn’t have to. For more than a decade, tech companies and advertisers have said there’s no need for opt outs, because people like targeted ads. I’m sure that’s true for some, or even most—but the rest of us should have a choice. Real choices mean informed consent—companies should explain what they’re doing with your data, why, and for how long, in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;50.875569044006&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, companies must be prevented from refusing service to those who do opt out. If your only options are to forego a useful product or consent to constant surveillance, you don’t really have a choice. Even more abusive are so-called &lt;em&gt;shadow profiles, &lt;/em&gt;which ad-tech companies create without your consent. If you don’t have a Facebook account, that’s your choice. Facebook shouldn’t have an account on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we must require technology companies to disclose device end points—in other words, to tell us what data they’re collecting, where it’s going, and how it’s getting there. Offering consumers this visibility will give them a better understanding of what is actually happening to their personal information when they use a device—and inform their purchasing decisions. In 2018, Microsoft voluntarily disclosed its end points for Windows 10, giving users a granular understanding of what data Windows is collecting, where it’s going, and how it’s getting there. That’s a great start, but more should follow Microsoft’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is some data that companies should never be allowed to collect, because of the significant risk of abuse. There is no reason why your ISP should be able to tell advertisers or health insurers that you may have diabetes, based on a connected glucose meter in your home.  Location is another example: you should be able to share your location to look up a restaurant without sharing your precise location on a minute-by-minute basis. To its credit, Apple has started to clamp down on apps requesting location data that they don’t need to provide functionality—this should be standard practice across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90318234/privacy-not-dead-its-just-not-evenly-distributed&quot;&gt;Privacy’s not dead—it’s just not evenly distributed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this need for a policy solution is Big Tech’s ‘conversion’ to the privacy cause. Google and Facebook have become two of the world’s most powerful companies by collecting and selling their users’ personal information: they are not about to change that business model unless they are forced to. Their recently announced privacy enhancements are more about monopolizing your data, not protecting it. And they’re hoping you don’t notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one bad actor responsible for this gradual degradation of our privacy. We are living in a system of perverse incentives, where good people clock into work each day and make the problem just a little bit worse, without understanding the bigger picture. We can and must correct course now to create a welcoming environment for innovation that doesn’t require us to surrender our private lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Stokes is the founder and CEO of Winston Privacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_recommendationlink&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Twitter is rejecting posts containing JSFiddle URLs</title>
<link>https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-issues/issues/1417</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-issues/issues/1417</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At some point in the past crypto scammers used JSFiddle to host pages with a wallet code and posted links to that on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of JSFiddle, anyone can post anything, so wallet codes are ok – we did implemented a content filter to shadow-ban these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Twitter if they they could help out and ban twitter accounts that were posting scam tweets that included links to the rogue fiddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter just went the easy route and blocked all jsfiddle.net links&lt;/strong&gt; instead of blocking spammer accounts on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried to contact Twitter many many times, with no reply whatsoever. They most likely have no-explanation-needed-policy, which is why they never replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing that can be done here unless somebody has contact to a higher op at Twitter who has the decision power to help out here.&lt;/p&gt;
