<title>Golden: Mapping human knowledge</title>
<link>https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://golden.com/blog/introducing-golden/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;After building and selling Heyzap back in 2016 I had free reign to dig into the question of “what should I really be working on?” and how to create something that would have a lasting impact on society. In part of this journey I’ve had the privilege to invest in over 150 startups from my Winter 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/wiki/Y_Combinator&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt; class to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/y-combinator-w19-companies/&quot;&gt;most recent batch&lt;/a&gt;. While researching areas of interest, I often wondered why we have such a lack of organization of human knowledge. This gap is especially apparent for emerging technologies, new startups and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--1-.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden’s mission is to collect, organize and express 10+ billion topics in an accessible way, presented in neutrally-written and comprehensive topic pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help achieve this mission we raised a $5 million seed round from &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz_(a16z)&quot;&gt;a16z&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Gigafund&quot;&gt;Gigafund&lt;/a&gt; (Luke and Steve), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Founders_Fund&quot;&gt;Founders Fund&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cyan_Banister&quot;&gt;Cyan Banister&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SV_Angel&quot;&gt;SV Angel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Liquid_2_Ventures&quot;&gt;Liquid 2 Ventures&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Joe_Montana&quot;&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3038448/dropboxs-first-employee-if-your-network-isnt-diverse-in-and-of-itself-then&quot;&gt;Aston Motes&lt;/a&gt; (1st employee at &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;), Christina Brodbeck (1st designer of Youtube), Lee Linden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Immad_Akhund&quot;&gt;Immad Akhund&lt;/a&gt; (my cofounder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Heyzap&quot;&gt;Heyzap&lt;/a&gt;, now CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Mercury&quot;&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;), Josh Buckley, Howie Liu (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Airtable&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;), James Smith (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Bugsnag&quot;&gt;Bugsnag&lt;/a&gt;), James Tamplin (Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Firebase&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;), Jack Smith, Mike Einziger of Incubus, Sumon Sadhu, Paul McKellar (Square founding team), Trip Adler (CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Scribd&quot;&gt;Scribd&lt;/a&gt;) and many other great angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-leading-edges-of-knowledge-from-the-quark-to-the-jaguar&quot;&gt;Mapping leading edges of knowledge — from the quark to the jaguar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An abundance of knowledge is available to us via the Internet, but navigating the cacophony of formats, designs, sources and standards is challenging. Google, Wikipedia, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Quora, StackExchange, Github, etc are our go-to places for seeking information. However, the knowledge reference products in the market today fall short of mapping, in a highly organized way, everything we collectively know as a human society and what exists on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific examples of topics that have been hard to find canonical information on include: &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cluster%3A_Blockchain_%26_cryptocurrency#Blockchain-Theory-and-Fundamentals_Consensus&quot;&gt;Consensus mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, new legal instruments like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SAFT_(Simple_Agreement_for_Future_Tokens)&quot;&gt;Simple Agreement for Future Tokens&lt;/a&gt;, new fund constructions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Cryptocurrency_hedge_fund&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency hedge funds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Arrington_XRP_Capital&quot;&gt;Arrington XRP Capital&lt;/a&gt;; companies/projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Benchling&quot;&gt;Benchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/HelloSign&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/CryptoKitties&quot;&gt;CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.co/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks&quot;&gt;Ginkgo Bioworks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Momentus_Space&quot;&gt;Momentus Space&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)&quot;&gt;Brave web browser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Google_AutoML&quot;&gt;Google AutoML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Algorand&quot;&gt;Algorand&lt;/a&gt;; academic areas e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Quantum_Artificial_Life&quot;&gt;Quantum Artificial Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Lenia&quot;&gt;Lenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/CRISPR-Cas13&quot;&gt;CRISPR/Cas13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution_(PACE)&quot;&gt;phage-assisted continuous evolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Constructor_theory&quot;&gt;constructor theory&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a small sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible and necessary to map everything that exists systematically and pull together academic papers, documentaries, videos, podcasts, further reading, guides and meta-data that surrounds these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notability-validation-and-the-knowledge-age&quot;&gt;Notability, validation and the Knowledge Age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of Wikipedia and use it multiple times per day. I believe it is one of the most important things that humans have ever built. However, as we speak, pages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/SV_Angel&quot;&gt;SV Angel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Benchling&quot;&gt;Benchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Lisk&quot;&gt;Lisk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Urbit&quot;&gt;Urbit&lt;/a&gt; and many others are and have been deleted from Wikipedia because they don't reach the notability standard of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Product_Hunt&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; was recently up for deletion but somehow survived the cull. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/HelloSign&quot;&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, a few weeks before Dropbox acquired it for $230 million was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/HelloSign&quot;&gt;removed from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/BuildZoom&quot;&gt;BuildZoom&lt;/a&gt; was removed 5 times from Wikipedia and now doesn't exist there. It doesn't just apply to company pages though. Actual technologies, projects, products, theoretical electrical components and academic ideas are missing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrary threshold of what is notable and what is not doesn't cut it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRGTsHhR10w&quot;&gt;Knowledge Age&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics&quot;&gt;5.8 million English language articles in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and Google had &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html&quot;&gt;1 billion objects (200x Wikipedia's size) in its Knowledge Graph&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in 2015. We estimate internally that there are 1000x the entities to cover than what Wikipedia has today. It’s an exciting challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in an age of extreme niches, an age when validation and completeness is more important than notability. Our encyclopedia on Golden doesn't have limited shelf space — we eventually want to map everything that exists. Special relativity was not notable to the general public the moment Einstein released his seminal paper, but certainly was later on — could this have been the kind of topic to be removed from the world's canon if it was discovered today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notability restrictions of our current encyclopedias limit the availability of knowledge around fascinating and useful niche topics. For this reason, we are taking a knowledge maximalist perspective. Let’s unleash hidden knowledge, using existence as a framework for whether a topic gets covered and supplement what Wikipedia has built over the last 18 years. Like a Mandelbrot set or squiggles from Fermat, the richness is in the edges and the margins and the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have a great opportunity to use new technologies to solve the problems: &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/suggestions&quot;&gt;human in the loop AI systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models&quot;&gt;fully automatic and unsupervised language writing systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate&quot;&gt;WYSIWYG editors&lt;/a&gt;, React, cheap cloud storage/processing, auto &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Grammarly&quot;&gt;spelling/grammar checking&lt;/a&gt;, graph databases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikitribune.com/project/real-names-policy-a-note-from-jimmy-wales/&quot;&gt;real identity&lt;/a&gt; and collaboration models like &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/wiki/Git&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; pave the way to build a new system for compiling and serving the knowledge. With that context in mind, we want to introduce you to Golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;encouraging-deep-extensive-knowledge&quot;&gt;Encouraging deep, extensive knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden has been designed from the start to encourage a deep, extensive view on knowledge. If an extremely niche topic is valuable to just a handful of people and positively contributes to society, it will have a home on Golden. Some initial areas of our focus will include core topics on science, technology, and business, but also on the leading edges of research and investigation in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-modern-editor&quot;&gt;A modern editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to a knowledge base shouldn’t require technical expertise or esoteric formatting knowledge. We’ve created a WYSIWYG editor to lower the barrier to entry and encourage more people to participate globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built speedy citation tools into Golden and intend to create more affordances around claim validation. You can simply highlight any claim and add a citation that is evidence to support that claim. All of these citations can then be easily viewed and examined by anyone viewing the article on Golden. We have gone a little step further by allowing ‘high resolution’ citations i.e. being able to highlight the specific part of the claim you want to back up. Over time, we want to have tighter bindings between claims and evidence in order to improve claim verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Magic-Citations.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Magic-Citations&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you identify a problem with a particular claim or how an article is written, Golden users can “Create an issue” to call attention to the issue. If there are multiple issues on a given article, each can be dealt with and resolved separately in its own discussion thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-ui-and-ai-to-save-human-time-and-get-better-results&quot;&gt;Using UI and AI to save human time and get better results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the thesis from day 1, we have aimed to remove all the repetitive work, bring leverage to editing, and add a little fun to the process. For example, we have built a system called “AI suggestions” which produces modular snippets of machine-learning outputs, suggested improvements that can be made to the content with simple “yes”, “no”, or “skip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/AI-Suggestions.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;AI-Suggestions&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be adding a crosslink to another topic page, or adding a link to an academic paper we have found around a topic. It could also be the detection and creation of an entirely new topic because it popped up inside multiple new academic papers and news publications, or it could be the addition of a detected thumbnail for the topic. Internally, we have many types of these and will release more to the general users as they become more robust. We’ve found that it’s fun to make atomic edits on mobile or on the move in a more casual way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-58-39.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-58-39&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have many more suggestion types coming out soon in order to increase the leverage of human help when putting the Golden knowledge base together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-56-00.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Suggestions--Golden-2019-04-23-12-56-00&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also built AI tools into the topic page editing experience. Simply click on the magic wand to enter AI-assisted mode. The AI assistant will use URLs to extract relevant information to add to the topic page. This particular feature is still early in its development but clearly shows how we want to empower human editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/screencast-2019-04-23-14-13-52.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;screencast-2019-04-23-14-13-52&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tables in Golden also take advantage of our AI extraction tools. When you paste a URL into one of our “magic cells” (i.e., a cell marked with the wand icon) in Golden, our tool will auto-extract key information from that URL, such as the title and authors of an article, abstracts, and more. This saves a lot of time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also considered what makes a rich schema around a topic in terms of the metadata that surrounds it. For example, every article has a timeline to show how that entity has evolved over time. You can post a URL into our timeline AI tool, quickly get a headline and summary about the events discussed in that link, and then modify the language to make it more neutral, canonical and encyclopedic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/Timeline-Detection-AI.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;Timeline-Detection-AI&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Golden AI bot is constantly working to connect knowledge across Golden and find resources that are relevant to each entity page by crawling the web. We have an extensive roadmap in this department and if you are interested in working on this problem at Golden please &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/about/careers&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;transparency-and-openness&quot;&gt;Transparency and openness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong need for this platform to be open so we are embracing Creative Commons 4.0 for the text on topic pages and are cognisant of current standards of openness. Public topic pages will be free to access and the text available on CC BY-SA 4.0. If you have any feedback on this, please get in touch with us. We also have full activity logs of changes to pages that aim to bring more &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/wiki/Geltor/activity&quot;&gt;transparency to edits&lt;/a&gt; and make it easier for our team and you to fact check, monitor, and improve edits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;golden-for-companies-sustainability-and-acceleration&quot;&gt;Golden for companies, sustainability and acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden topic pages are completely free and open to the public. People will be able to view, edit, or create entities on Golden forever. However, our vast knowledge base and query capability means we can also provide a number of tools and services that particularly benefit &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/enterprise&quot;&gt;companies and organizations&lt;/a&gt;. The features below are designed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/pricing&quot;&gt;paid&lt;/a&gt; users. We believe there is a good incentive alignment to have correct information on Golden that can also serve commercial-grade research requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advanced-query-tool&quot;&gt;Advanced query tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of building the Golden knowledge base includes identifying and developing a wide range of structured and unstructured data. Paid users can use the Golden Query Tool to search across Golden’s knowledge base to find specific information in more corporate-focused queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://golden.com/blog/content/images/2019/04/enterprise-query.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;enterprise-query&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do, from time to time, open up queries to the public that we think are useful for everyone, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/y-combinator-w19-companies&quot;&gt;Y Combinator Batch W19&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-therapeutics-companies&quot;&gt;a list of therapeutics companies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-venture-capital-firms/&quot;&gt;all the VC firms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/cryptocurrency-whitepapers&quot;&gt;all crypto currency projects we could find whitepapers for&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/list-of-regenerative-medicine-companies/&quot;&gt;regenerative medicine companies&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this advanced query tool is extremely useful for investment funds, large consultancies and large companies, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/about/contact-us&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you want to experience one of the best query tools out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fine-grained-alerts&quot;&gt;Fine-grained alerts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve saved a particular search query that you want to monitor, you can set up alerts to be notified if any new results match your query. Users can also set alerts on particular attributes they’re monitoring on their queries or lists. For example, you can be alerted if a company has a spinout, changes CEO, enters a new market, releases a new technology, and many other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-requests-and-subsidizing-public-knowledge&quot;&gt;Research requests and subsidizing public knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden aims to have complete knowledge across a wide swath of companies, people, products, technologies and beyond. If you're looking for knowledge that's not in Golden today, please contact us! We have high-quality researchers available to build out knowledge in areas you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built this into our paid plans too. Paid users who come across topic pages that don’t have as much desired information can simply click the “Request info” button. This kicks off a process with our research team and AI bots to quickly build better and more content. If users don’t get the results they expect in the Golden Query Tool, a similar button exists to start the same process to find topics that fulfill the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-for-golden&quot;&gt;Future for Golden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;help-build-a-knowledge-base-for-the-world&quot;&gt;Help build a knowledge base for the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome your feedback and support, whether you have found a bug, security issue, new feature request, want to help produce public content, or have a bone to pick with our policies — &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/about/contact-us&quot;&gt;please do get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage each person reading this &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/signup&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; and contribute knowledge to Golden.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, we specifically welcome contributions from users of under-represented groups in order to ensure we build the most comprehensive and diverse knowledge base possible. A good way to start is to add information about your company or organization in a neutral, third person voice (no marketing language please). If you have a dataset that you’d like to share with us and open source to help make the world’s knowledge more complete, please contact us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not ready to write something yourself, you can still &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/signup&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; and contribute by &lt;a href=&quot;http://golden.com/suggestions&quot;&gt;reviewing the suggestions our AI systems create for human approval&lt;/a&gt;. Doing this helps tune our AI systems and provides valuable feedback to make Golden grow even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to thank my brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden.com/about&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; and contributors of Golden for working so hard to get us to a promising V0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: Thanks to Carla Faraguna, Jed Christiansen, Rachel Phythian, and Chris Barrett for editing and helping with the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Why Purism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;We believe people should have secure devices an services that protect them rather than exploit them. We provide everything you need in a convenient product bundle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Purism has been rapidly growing since 2014, successfully delivering on four revisions of the popular Librem 13 and Librem 15 laptops, also delivering the development kit for the upcoming and exciting security and privacy focused Librem 5 phone that runs PureOS—avoiding Android and iOS—to offer convenient ethical alternatives to Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Purism does hardware, software, applications, and now—with Librem One—services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://librem.one/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/purism_graphic-2-1024x448.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-466&quot; srcset=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/purism_graphic-2-1024x448.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/purism_graphic-2-300x131.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/purism_graphic-2-768x336.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/purism_graphic-2.png 1138w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;By creating an ecosystem that advances social good, societal freedom, personal privacy, and the best security, Purism is changing the world for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Business Models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Business models are a great way to see how a business operates and if it operates in your best interest, we think it’s a clear indication as to why people prefer to interact with organizations that they trust and see as fair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in &lt;strong&gt;2004&lt;/strong&gt;, a for Profit Company, &lt;strong&gt;spies on you and friends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in &lt;strong&gt;1998&lt;/strong&gt;, a for Profit Company, &lt;strong&gt;tracks you for profit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in &lt;strong&gt;1976&lt;/strong&gt;, a for Profit Company, &lt;strong&gt;controls you and locks you in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;News articles proving the untrustworthiness of technology giants continues daily… It is time for ethical alternatives, it is time for Librem One.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Walk the walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Purism is founded on core principles that have been publicly shared over the years:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Technical Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Each server side service that Purism provides as part of Librem One utilizes and encompasses a philosophy of decentralization (so you can communicate to other people on other systems), free software (so you can know and verify you are not being tracked or controlled), and standard protocols (so we advance sharing not vendor lock-in) as the underlying technology, this offers interoperability (so it plays nice with others) and self-hosting options (so you can host your own for your business or your friends or even yourself). Our services are powered by &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://pureos.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PureOS&lt;/a&gt;, Purism’s &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;rights respecting operating system (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-adds-pureos-to-list-of-endorsed-gnu-linux-distributions-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rights respecting operating system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Librem Mail – Standard SMTP/IMAP/POP MTA, with OpenPGP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Librem Tunnel – OpenVPN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Librem Chat – Matrix, XMPP (coming soon)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Librem Social – ActivityPub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Each client Purism offers as part of Librem One utilizes free software (to respect your freedoms) based clients across all platforms ensuring the rights of people are protected while third party verification of privacy and security protections can be confirmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;The growth plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Initially launching with a handful of services, Librem One will continue to improve existing services and expand across a growing number of other services. Learning from experience, we are taking an incremental approach to solving the issues plaguing society by methodically adding new services under your single account.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;All future services released under the Librem One banner will be included with the subscription at no additional charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Stretch goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.7098193608152&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50,000 backers – Librem Files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;A long-term end-to-end encrypted cloud storage solution to back-up in full all your valuable devices and data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;A freely licensed OpenPGP client for all your friends in Cupertino!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;200,000 backers – Librem Dial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;A virtual phone number bundled into your account that allows you to dial any phone number from your Librem One account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;400,000 backers – Librem Pay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;The ability to add a crypto payment translation layer to your Librem One account, and pay at stores using a virtual credit card linked to a crypto bank back-end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;500,000 backers – Reproducible builds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Reproducible builds for all server and client components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;750,000 backers – Librem Onion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Access all services via onion routing (Tor)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;There are no risks in the services offered today, since those are literally subscribe-and-use now. The risk therefore only encompass when each additional services will be added to your current account. We have outlined some stretch goals to get us there faster. Either way, it will happen, it is just a matter of when.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;All or nothing campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;While this is an all-or-nothing campaign, the number of backers scales with relative ease, so we can set the minimum threshold rather low and scale up services by demand. So please spread the word, and we can change the future for the better together!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can Librem One work on Android and iOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Yes it works and is available in Android Play Store and Apple App Store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do I need to pay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;We are changing the landscape of digital rights, which includes changing the business model from the previous exploitative zero-price for all-your-data, to a nominal-price to retain your digital rights, data, and privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get a free Librem One account?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Since not everybody can afford to pay, we do offer a free Librem One Basic account if you agree to strictly avoid products and services from big-tech that exploit you, lock you in, and control your data. If you agree to that, select the ‘FREE’ option for Librem One Basic: Social + Chat service, and you can get a free account as a gesture of gratitude from Purism, SPC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I communicate to people on other services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Yes! Librem One uses open standards, free software, and decentralized protocols for all our services; similar to email, you can communicate to anybody using the same protocols for chat, email, and social, this allows you to communicate across different domains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I delete Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instragram and switch to Librem One?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Each of these services, all owned by Facebook, has a different set of steps for deletion.

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I delete G+ and switch to Librem One?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Google Plus shut down on April 2nd 2019. You can still check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/plus/answer/6320423?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-a-Google+-Account&quot;&gt;WikiHow&lt;/a&gt; guide to make sure your account is gone.

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I delete Gmail and switch to Librem One?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;To delete your Gmail account, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61177?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-a-Google-or-Gmail-Account&quot;&gt;WikiHow&lt;/a&gt; guide. Then sign up here!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get Librem One that is integrated into Librem laptops or the Librem 5 phone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Currently you will install and setup the applications individually, in the future you will be able to just sign-up and then log-in during initial product setup and have all the services available by default.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this for my friend or family?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Yes, you can buy an individual account or a Family Pack, and then download the bundle and have the persons sign-in using the account you created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I live in a different country, can I buy and use Librem One?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Yes, we accept many forms of payment and even offer a free basic service, Librem One has no restrictions on geolocation or country, if your country has rules or regulations that limit service it is not due to Librem One restrictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can legal requests from authorities see my data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Public (Librem Social) is publicly visible to everybody. Private end-to-end encrypted data (chat, email, tunnel) is only visible to you and the intended recipient(s). If something is not Public and not Private, it is Temporary (unencrypted direct messages, unencrypted email) and is removed within 30 days. Any valid legal request for data is complied with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much mail can I store? How many images can I post?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Basic tier users have a 1 GiB storage quota across all services. Complete tier users have a 2 GiB quota. If you exceed your quota, your oldest messages/posts will be deleted, until you are within quota again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I purchase additional storage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Once Librem Files and Librem Backup are released, you will be able to opt-in to a pay-as-you-go storage plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much traffic can go through my tunnel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;You can tunnel unlimited traffic from up to 10 devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I report illegal content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Any illegal content or illegal acts should be reported to the appropriate authorities who are equipped to handle it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if you’re successful, won’t you become just like Big Tech and lock-me-in or spy-on-me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;No, we are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/about/social-purpose/&quot;&gt;Social Purpose Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, which means we are bound by our articles of incorporation that clearly state we cannot exploit people and that we must put doing social good over maximizing profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t my username contain a dot, underscore, accents, non-roman letters or emoji?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Your username needs to be valid across multiple existing and future protocols and services. So we permit only the “lowest common denominator”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Note that most clients let you set your “display name” to anything you want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t I have a different username for Mail and Social?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;You can do this with two accounts. For example, register basic@librem.one for chat and social posts, and register complete@librem.one for mail and tunnel services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Multiple accounts also allow you to implement a separation of concerns. For example, you could have a business account, and a separate account when discussing a medical condition with your support network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;To protect your privacy, we do not store a mapping between accounts, except in the case of family packs where one user is financially responsible for multiple accounts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why doesn’t Librem Tunnel work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Please confirm that you have subscribed to a Complete or Family Pack account. Then visit your profile page to activate your tunnel connection. Once you have done this your Librem Tunnel client will work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why doesn’t Librem Mail work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Please confirm that you have subscribed to a Complete or Family Pack account.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I send and receive encrypted mail on my Apple device?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;On the macOS desktop you can use Thunderbird to encrypt email with OpenPGP. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x&quot;&gt;Read the EFF’s how-to on PGP for macOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;There is no free software solution for OpenPGP on iOS today. You can still send and receive temporary messages from the Mail app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;With enough backers, we will build a solution! (See our stretch goals!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What details do I need to set up Librem Mail in the iOS Mail app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Follow the steps from Apple to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201320#manual&quot;&gt;Set up your email account manually&lt;/a&gt; with the following details:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Account type: IMAP&lt;br/&gt;Host name: imap.librem.one&lt;br/&gt;Outgoing mail server: smtp.librem.one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is configuring Librem Mail in the iOS Mail app so hard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Librem Mail is a new email provider. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/mail-settings-lookup&quot;&gt;Our server details are not yet recorded by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and unlike other clients, the Mail app doesn’t perform this lookup automatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you release your apps on F-Droid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Yes! In the meantime, any app that speaks our open protocols will work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I find other compatible apps, including desktop clients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;The following guides and lists will help:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-light&quot;&gt;Chat. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/docs/projects/clients-matrix&quot;&gt;the Matrix Clients Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

<og:title>Librem One by Purism - We don't look at your junk... or anything else.</og:title>
<og:description>Purism is a Social Purpose Corporation (SPC), which means we put social good above exploiting people. Librem One is a bundle of services—chat, vpn, email, social, and more—from Purism, SPC. We believe that privacy and technology can be moral and convenient.

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOUL project is currently at a very early stage in its evolution! We're hard at work on a native API which we aim to release in Q4 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we wanted to let people explore the language and give us feedback. This playground lets you write and share simple SOUL programs in your browser, using Web Audio and Web MIDI to play the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn about the language itself, a good place to start is to read the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/blob/master/docs/SOUL_Language.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;syntax guide&lt;/a&gt; and look through the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://soul.dev/examples&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn about what's planned for the SOUL platform, have a read of the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/blob/master/docs/SOUL_Overview.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/blob/master/docs/SOUL_FAQ.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give us feedback or ask questions, our usual haunt is the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://forum.juce.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JUCE Forum&lt;/a&gt;, so feel free to pop over and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Netflix's &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt; was released two years ago, depicting the life of a teenager who decided to take her own life, educators and psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/05/526871398/facts-about-teens-suicide-and-13-reasons-why&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; the program could lead to copycat suicides. Now, a study funded by the National Institutes of Health shows that those concerns may have been warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month following the show's debut in March 2017, there was a 28.9% increase in suicide among Americans ages 10-17, said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(19)30288-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published Monday in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;. The number of suicides was greater than that seen in any single month over the five-year period researchers examined. Over the rest of the year, there were 195 more youth suicides than expected given historical trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that their study could not prove causation. Some unknown third factor might have been responsible for the increase, they said. Still, citing the strong correlation, they cautioned against exposing children and adolescents to the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The results of this study should raise awareness that young people are particularly vulnerable to the media,&quot; study co-author Lisa Horowitz, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, said in a statement. &quot;All disciplines, including the media, need to take good care to be constructive and thoughtful about topics that intersect with public health crises.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Jeff Bridge, a suicide researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, told The Associated Press that an additional analysis found the April suicide rate was higher than in the previous 19 years. &quot;The creators of the series intentionally portrayed the suicide of the main character. It was a very graphic depiction of the suicide death,&quot; he said, which can lead to suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that boys were far more likely than girls to kill themselves after the show debuted. Suicide rates for females did increase, but it was not statistically significant. Nor were there any &quot;significant trends&quot; in suicide rates for people 18-64, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res718538004&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage607066609&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/05/16/607066609/as-13-reasons-why-returns-schools-try-to-help-students-who-are-thinking-of-suici&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/ed\/2018\/05\/16\/607066609\/as-13-reasons-why-returns-schools-try-to-help-students-who-are-thinking-of-suici&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/14/fazim-schoolsuicides_sq-f7a8bc3c307fc9e3e4e625816ca64b16dd1d1dc2-s100-c15.png&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/14/fazim-schoolsuicides_sq-f7a8bc3c307fc9e3e4e625816ca64b16dd1d1dc2-s100.png&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;As '13 Reasons Why' Returns, Schools Try To Help Students Who Are Thinking Of Suicide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Netflix spokesperson said they had &quot;just seen this study and are looking into the research. &quot;This is a critically important topic and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly,&quot; Netflix said, according to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson noted that the study conflicts with research published last week out of the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619302072?via%3Dihub)&quot;&gt;That study&lt;/a&gt; found that young adults, ages 18-29, who watched the entire second season of the show &quot;reported declines in suicide ideation and self-harm relative to those who did not watch the show at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that study found, viewers who stopped watching the second season before the end &quot;exhibited greater suicide risk and less optimism about the future than those who continued to the end.&quot; The results &quot;suggest that a fictional story with a focus on suicidal content can have both harmful and helpful effects,&quot; the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the show debuted, the National Association of School Psychologists issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources/school-safety-and-crisis/preventing-youth-suicide/13-reasons-why-netflix-series/13-reasons-why-netflix-series-considerations-for-educators&quot;&gt;warning statement&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We do not recommend that vulnerable youth, especially those who have any degree of suicidal ideation, watch this series. Its powerful storytelling may lead impressionable viewers to romanticize the choices made by the characters and/or develop revenge fantasies,&quot; they said. &quot;Suicide is not a solution to problems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the criticism, Netflix added a &quot;viewer warning card&quot; before the first episode. Netflix also added language publicizing the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://13reasonswhy.info/&quot;&gt;13reasonswhy.info&lt;/a&gt;, which offers resources for people contemplating suicide. Season 3 of the show is expected to be released this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6e0b&quot; id=&quot;6e0b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As many of us prepare to go to PyCon, we wanted to share a sampling of how Python is used at Netflix. We use Python through the full content lifecycle, from deciding which content to fund all the way to operating the CDN that serves the final video to 148 million members. We use and contribute to many open-source Python packages, some of which are mentioned below. If any of this interests you, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=python&quot; data-href=&quot;https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=python&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jobs site&lt;/a&gt; or find us at PyCon. We have donated a few Netflix Originals posters to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/auction/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/auction/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PyLadies Auction&lt;/a&gt; and look forward to seeing you all there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b484&quot; id=&quot;b484&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Open Connect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;feee&quot; id=&quot;feee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Connect&lt;/a&gt; is Netflix’s content delivery network (CDN). An easy, though imprecise, way of thinking about Netflix infrastructure is that everything that happens before you press Play on your remote control (e.g., are you logged in? what plan do you have? what have you watched so we can recommend new titles to you? what do you want to watch?) takes place in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whereas everything that happens afterwards (i.e., video streaming) takes place in the Open Connect network. Content is placed on the network of servers in the Open Connect CDN as close to the end user as possible, improving the streaming experience for our customers and reducing costs for both Netflix and our Internet Service Provider (ISP) partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d9d&quot; id=&quot;9d9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Various software systems are needed to design, build, and operate this CDN infrastructure, and a significant number of them are written in Python. The network devices that underlie a large portion of the CDN are mostly managed by Python applications. Such applications track the inventory of our network gear: what devices, of which models, with which hardware components, located in which sites. The configuration of these devices is controlled by several other systems including source of truth, application of configurations to devices, and back up. Device interaction for the collection of health and other operational data is yet another Python application. Python has long been a popular programming language in the networking space because it’s an intuitive language that allows engineers to quickly solve networking problems. Subsequently, many useful libraries get developed, making the language even more desirable to learn and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;9ce3&quot; id=&quot;9ce3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Demand Engineering&lt;/h4&gt;

We are proud to say that our team’s tools are built primarily in Python. The service that orchestrates failover uses numpy and scipy to perform numerical analysis, boto3 to make changes to our AWS infrastructure, rq to run asynchronous workloads and we wrap it all up in a thin layer of Flask APIs. The ability to drop into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpython-interpreter.org&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bpython-interpreter.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bpython&lt;/a&gt; shell and improvise has saved the day more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7509&quot; id=&quot;7509&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are heavy users of Jupyter Notebooks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nteract.io&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nteract.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nteract&lt;/a&gt; to analyze operational data and prototype &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/data-explorer&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/data-explorer&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;visualization tools&lt;/a&gt; that help us detect capacity regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;9dec&quot; id=&quot;9dec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;CORE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd4e&quot; id=&quot;dd4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The CORE team uses Python in our alerting and statistical analytical work. We lean on many of the statistical and mathematical libraries (numpy, scipy, ruptures, pandas) to help automate the analysis of 1000s of related signals when our alerting systems indicate problems. We’ve developed a time series correlation system used both inside and outside the team as well as a distributed worker system to parallelize large amounts of analytical work to deliver results quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b7df&quot; id=&quot;b7df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Python is also a tool we typically use for automation tasks, data exploration and cleaning, and as a convenient source for visualization work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;951a&quot; id=&quot;951a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Monitoring, alerting and auto-remediation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c74&quot; id=&quot;3c74&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The Insight Engineering team is responsible for building and operating the tools for operational insight, alerting, diagnostics, and auto-remediation. With the increased popularity of Python, the team now supports Python clients for most of their services. One example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/spectator-py&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/spectator-py&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; Python client library, a library for instrumenting code to record dimensional time series metrics. We build Python libraries to interact with other Netflix platform level services. In addition to libraries, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-winston-event-driven-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-46ce39aa81cc&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-winston-event-driven-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-46ce39aa81cc&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-bolt-on-instance-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-176651b55505&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-bolt-on-instance-diagnostic-and-remediation-platform-176651b55505&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bolt&lt;/a&gt; products are also built using Python frameworks (Gunicorn + Flask + Flask-RESTPlus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0c77&quot; id=&quot;0c77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Information Security&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf36&quot; id=&quot;cf36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The information security team uses Python to accomplish a number of high leverage goals for Netflix: security automation, risk classification, auto-remediation, and vulnerability identification to name a few. We’ve had a number of successful Python open sources, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Security Monkey&lt;/a&gt; (our team’s most active open source project). We leverage Python to protect our SSH resources using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/bless&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/bless&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;. Our Infrastructure Security team leverages Python to help with IAM permission tuning using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/repokid&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/repokid&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Repokid&lt;/a&gt;. We use Python to help generate TLS certificates using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/lemur&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/lemur&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lemur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd6a&quot; id=&quot;fd6a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some of our more recent projects include Prism: a batch framework to help security engineers measure paved road adoption, risk factors, and identify vulnerabilities in source code. We currently provide Python and Ruby libraries for Prism. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-sirt-releases-diffy-a-differencing-engine-for-digital-forensics-in-the-cloud-37b71abd2698&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-sirt-releases-diffy-a-differencing-engine-for-digital-forensics-in-the-cloud-37b71abd2698&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diffy&lt;/a&gt; forensics triage tool is written entirely in Python. We also use Python to detect sensitive data using Lanius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;078a&quot; id=&quot;078a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Personalization Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;df37&quot; id=&quot;df37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We use Python extensively within our broader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Personalization Machine Learning Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to train some of the Machine Learning models for key aspects of the Netflix experience: from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations&quot; data-href=&quot;https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommendation algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;artwork personalization&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/engineering-to-scale-paid-media-campaigns-84ba018fb3fa&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/engineering-to-scale-paid-media-campaigns-84ba018fb3fa&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;marketing algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. For example, some algorithms use TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch to learn Deep Neural Networks, XGBoost and LightGBM to learn Gradient Boosted Decision Trees or the broader scientific stack in Python (e.g. numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, cvxpy). Because we’re constantly trying out new approaches, we use Jupyter Notebooks to drive many of our experiments. We have also developed a number of higher-level libraries to help integrate these with the rest of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/FaisalZakariaSiddiqi/ml-infra-for-netflix-recommendations-ai-nextcon-talk&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. data access, fact logging and feature extraction, model evaluation, and publishing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6460&quot; id=&quot;6460&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c270&quot; id=&quot;c270&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Besides personalization, Netflix applies machine learning to hundreds of use cases across the company. Many of these applications are powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5VGddmP24&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5VGddmP24&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metaflow&lt;/a&gt;, a Python framework that makes it easy to execute ML projects from the prototype stage to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;856d&quot; id=&quot;856d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Metaflow pushes the limits of Python: We leverage well parallelized and optimized Python code to fetch data at 10Gbps, handle hundreds of millions of data points in memory, and orchestrate computation over tens of thousands of CPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;9622&quot; id=&quot;9622&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Notebooks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2f8a&quot; id=&quot;2f8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We are avid users of Jupyter notebooks at Netflix, and we’ve written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reasons and nature of this investment&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;78cf&quot; id=&quot;78cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But Python plays a huge role in how we provide those services. Python is a primary language when we need to develop, debug, explore, and prototype different interactions with the Jupyter ecosystem. We use Python to build custom extensions to the Jupyter server that allows us to manage tasks like logging, archiving, publishing, and cloning notebooks on behalf of our users.&lt;br/&gt;We provide many flavors of Python to our users via different Jupyter kernels, and manage the deployment of those kernel specifications using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;bc82&quot; id=&quot;bc82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Orchestration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6517&quot; id=&quot;6517&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The Big Data Orchestration team is responsible for providing all of the services and tooling to schedule and execute ETL and Adhoc pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef3a&quot; id=&quot;ef3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many of the components of the orchestration service are written in Python. Starting with our scheduler, which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org&quot; data-href=&quot;https://jupyter.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;papermill&lt;/a&gt; to provide templatized job types (Spark, Presto, …). This allows our users to have a standardized and easy way to express work that needs to be executed. You can see some deeper details on the subject &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We have been using notebooks as real runbooks for situations where human intervention is required — for example: to restart everything that has failed in the last hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d787&quot; id=&quot;d787&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Internally, we also built an event-driven platform that is fully written in Python. We have created streams of events from a number of systems that get unified into a single tool. This allows us to define conditions to filter events, and actions to react or route them. As a result of this, we have been able to decouple microservices and get visibility into everything that happens on the data platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a413&quot; id=&quot;a413&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our team also built the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/pygenie&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/pygenie&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pygenie&lt;/a&gt; client which interfaces with &lt;a href=&quot;https://netflix.github.io/genie/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://netflix.github.io/genie/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt;, a federated job execution service. Internally, we have additional extensions to this library that apply business conventions and integrate with the Netflix platform. These libraries are the primary way users interface programmatically with work in the Big Data platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0dfb&quot; id=&quot;0dfb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Finally, it’s been our team’s commitment to contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;papermill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nteract-scrapbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nteract-scrapbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scrapbook&lt;/a&gt; open source projects. Our work there has been both for our own and external use cases. These efforts have been gaining a lot of traction in the open source community and we’re glad to be able to contribute to these shared projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4760&quot; id=&quot;4760&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Experimentation Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e584&quot; id=&quot;e584&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The scientific computing team for experimentation is creating a platform for scientists and engineers to analyze AB tests and other experiments. Scientists and engineers can contribute new innovations on three fronts, data, statistics, and visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0b82&quot; id=&quot;0b82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Metrics Repo is a Python framework based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PyPika&lt;/a&gt; that allows contributors to write reusable parameterized SQL queries. It serves as an entry point into any new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57ea&quot; id=&quot;57ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Causal Models library is a Python &amp;amp; R framework for scientists to contribute new models for causal inference. It leverages &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PyArrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RPy2&lt;/a&gt; so that statistics can be calculated seamlessly in either language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;237e&quot; id=&quot;237e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Visualizations library is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly&quot; data-href=&quot;https://plot.ly&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;. Since Plotly is a widely adopted visualization spec, there are a variety of tools that allow contributors to produce an output that is consumable by our platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f9e5&quot; id=&quot;f9e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Partner Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;47c8&quot; id=&quot;47c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The Partner Ecosystem group is expanding its use of Python for testing Netflix applications on devices. Python is forming the core of a new CI infrastructure, including controlling our orchestration servers, controlling Spinnaker, test case querying and filtering, and scheduling test runs on devices and containers. Additional post-run analysis is being done in Python using TensorFlow to determine which tests are most likely to show problems on which devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;fdb1&quot; id=&quot;fdb1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Video Encoding and Media Cloud Engineering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;43af&quot; id=&quot;43af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Our team takes care of encoding (and re-encoding) the Netflix catalog, as well as leveraging machine learning for insights into that catalog.&lt;br/&gt;We use Python for ~50 projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/blob/master/resource/doc/references.md&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/blob/master/resource/doc/references.md&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vmaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/mezzfs-mounting-object-storage-in-netflixs-media-processing-platform-cda01c446ba&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/mezzfs-mounting-object-storage-in-netflixs-media-processing-platform-cda01c446ba&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mezzfs&lt;/a&gt;, we build &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/ava-the-art-and-science-of-image-discovery-at-netflix-a442f163af6&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/ava-the-art-and-science-of-image-discovery-at-netflix-a442f163af6&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;computer vision solutions&lt;/a&gt; using a media map-reduce platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/simplifying-media-innovation-at-netflix-with-archer-3f8cbb0e2bcb&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/simplifying-media-innovation-at-netflix-with-archer-3f8cbb0e2bcb&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;, and we use Python for many internal projects.&lt;br/&gt;We have also open sourced a few tools to ease development/distribution of Python projects, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/setupmeta/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/setupmeta/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;setupmeta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pickley/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pickley/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pickley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e179&quot; id=&quot;e179&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Netflix Animation and NVFX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bcd4&quot; id=&quot;bcd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Python is the industry standard for all of the major applications we use to create Animated and VFX content, so it goes without saying that we are using it very heavily. All of our integrations with Maya and Nuke are in Python, and the bulk of our Shotgun tools are also in Python. We’re just getting started on getting our tooling in the cloud, and anticipate deploying many of our own custom Python AMIs/containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;318d&quot; id=&quot;318d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Content Machine Learning, Science &amp;amp; Analytics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a7a9&quot; id=&quot;a7a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing&quot;&gt;The Content Machine Learning team uses Python extensively for the development of machine learning models that are the core of forecasting audience size, viewership, and other demand metrics for all content.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How pharmaceutical industry financial modelers think about rare diseases</title>
<link>http://www.cureffi.org/2019/04/29/financial-modeling-in-rare-disease/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.cureffi.org/2019/04/29/financial-modeling-in-rare-disease/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cureffi.org/media/2019/04/pistachios.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist about 1,500 FDA-approved drugs [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680947&quot; title=&quot;Kinch MS, Haynesworth A, Kinch SL, Hoyer D. An overview of FDA-approved new molecular entities: 1827-2013. Drug Discov Today. 2014 Aug;19(8):1033-9. doi: 10.1016/j.drudis.2014.03.018. Epub 2014 Mar 26. Review. PubMed PMID: 24680947.&quot;&gt;Kinch 2014&lt;/a&gt;] and, to the best of my knowledge none in recent history has been developed without the involvement of a pharmaceutical company. Therefore, if you discover that you or someone you love has an incurable disease, and you decide you want to do something to change that, it is likely that at some point you will want to convince a pharmaceutical company to take interest in your disease. When you do, hopefully you will talk good science and tell a good personal story too, but at some point, the project may be evaluated by someone whose job it is to create financial models and figure out whether there is money in it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is my situation. My wife and I found out seven years ago that she inherited a fatal genetic mutation that causes prion disease, and in response we both quit our old jobs, began re-training as scientists, and set out to find a drug for her disease. In the process we started the Prions@Broad initiative at the Broad Institute, we founded our non-profit Prion Alliance, and we started this blog. We also knocked on a lot of doors. Over the past seven years, we’ve met with tens of different companies to tell them about our disease, hear about their technology, and see if there was any way we could convince them to work on it. In most cases there wasn’t a clear enough nexus between our disease and their technology, but in a few cases things went far enough that someone started crunching numbers, modeling how and whether a drug for prion disease could be profitable. Over time we started asking what these models involved, figuring that understanding their thought process would give us a clearer idea of how this industry works, and what we as patient-scientists need to do to make our disease appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking off the record with a number of people in the industry and reading a few publicly available sources — see for instance [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11533634&quot; title=&quot;Stewart JJ, Allison PN, Johnson RS. Putting a price on biotechnology. Nat Biotechnol. 2001 Sep;19(9):813-7. PubMed PMID: 11533634.&quot;&gt;Stewart 2001&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23586005/&quot; title=&quot;Svennebring AM, Wikberg JE. Net present value approaches for drug discovery. Springerplus. 2013 Apr 1;2(1):140. doi: 10.1186/2193-1801-2-140. Print 2013 Dec. PubMed PMID: 23586005; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC3622797.&quot;&gt;Svennebring 2013&lt;/a&gt;], and &lt;a href=&quot;https://torreya.com/publications/pharmaceutical-valuation-in-licensing-dec2013-torreya.pdf&quot;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt;, we have gotten a reasonable grasp. In this post, I’ll talk through my best understanding of how these financial models work, what assumptions are made, and what I think this explains about how the pharmaceutical industry works. Finally, I’ll share some thoughts on what these models imply that motivated patients can do to advance therapies for their own diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-models-work&quot;&gt;how the models work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learned in Economics 101 that profit equals &lt;strong&gt;revenue&lt;/strong&gt; minus &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;, so for drugs as for any other product, right there are two variables that matter. But for drugs, there are extra wrinkles. Compared to many products, drugs have two outsized complications: the revenues come long after the costs at best, and maybe they never come at all because the drug fails. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;lag time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;probability of success&lt;/strong&gt; are the other two major variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those variables in mind, at a high level the models are simply net present value (NPV) or internal rate of return (IRR) models — they basically ask how, after adjusting for the probability of success and lag time, the potential longer-term revenues compare to the nearer-term costs. You arrange a spreadsheet with, say, one column for every year over a few decades, and one row per cost or revenue line item. At the top you input a large number of assumptions, which might be anything from wild guesses to reasonable benchmarks based on experiences with other drugs. One has to assume a discount rate, perhaps chosen based on some idea of what risk-adjusted rate of return you could make on your next best possible investment. One also has to assume what the drug development timeline looks like: what years you spend in which clinical trial phases and so on. And one makes number of different assumptions to drive an estimate of what the costs and potential revenues are. There are infinitely many details one can, and sometimes does, add to such a model — the rate of ramp-up in prescribing after drug approval, the time until market entry by generics after loss of exclusivity, corporate overhead and sales costs, and on and on. But at the level that I as a patient care about it, the take-home lessons from all this don’t depend much upon this extreme level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find a publicly available example of a financial model spreadsheet, so I tried my hand at creating my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7_R5c9HstVNcT7NuFlOpWZBv_LJe6QQSHAv_ZKAbnY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;simple NPV model in Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; so that I could play with it and see how differing assumptions propagate through the system. You’re welcome to clone it and play with it yourself. In a moment I will talk through each of the assumptions and how they have shaped my thinking about what we can do to catalyze drug development in our disease. But first I want to take a high-level look at the model results and think about what they explain about how the pharmaceutical industry works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the biggest lesson from playing with this model has been to observe just how profoundly the lag time and probability of success shape the financial picture of drug development. Under the assumptions I have made, here’s a plot of the &lt;em&gt;nominal&lt;/em&gt; — non-discounted and non-probability-adjusted — annual costs (red) and revenue (black) for this drug over the next 30 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cureffi.org/media/2019/04/npv-nominal.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see at a glance that the total area of the black bars is greater than the total area of the red bars. This reflects the fact that, in nominal terms, the drug would be profitable — a company would stand to net $211 million by investing in this drug today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the discounting and in the risk. Here is a plot of these factors impact the picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cureffi.org/media/2019/04/npv-discount-probability.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow line is the discount factor, assuming a discount rate of 8% (this assumption is discussed further below). A dollar next year is worth 92¢ today, a dollar two years from now is worth 85¢, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark purple line is the probability of reaching each stage, based on an arbitrary assumption of 50% probability of advancing from preclinical to clinical, followed by the published clinical trial success rates for each phase as reported in [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406927&quot; title=&quot;Hay M, Thomas DW, Craighead JL, Economides C, Rosenthal J. Clinical development success rates for investigational drugs. Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Jan;32(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2786. PubMed PMID: 24406927.&quot;&gt;Hay 2014&lt;/a&gt;]. To give you a sense of the damage, it is estimated that only 10.4% [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406927&quot; title=&quot;Hay M, Thomas DW, Craighead JL, Economides C, Rosenthal J. Clinical development success rates for investigational drugs. Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Jan;32(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2786. PubMed PMID: 24406927.&quot;&gt;Hay 2014&lt;/a&gt;] to 11.83% [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26928437&quot; title=&quot;DiMasi JA, Grabowski HG, Hansen RW. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&amp;amp;D costs. J Health Econ. 2016 May;47:20-33. doi: 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012. Epub 2016 Feb 12. PubMed PMID: 26928437.&quot;&gt;DiMasi 2016&lt;/a&gt;] of drugs entering a Phase I clinical trial ultimately result in an approved New Drug Application (NDA). That’s terrible news, mitigated only slightly by the fact that many things that fail, at least have the decency to fail early enough that their failure saves many would-be costs in addition to abolishing would-be revenues. Thus, the probability of reaching each stage of development applies to both costs and revenues in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devastatingly earthbound pink line is the product of these two factors — the discount factor times the probability of reaching each stage. This curve looks so terrible that I had to go back and double check my assumptions and make sure I hadn’t made an arithmetic error somewhere in my spreadsheet. But sadly, it’s true. The compounding of 8% discounting means that a dollar in year 17, the year in which this hypothetical drug is approved, is worth only 26¢ today. And the probability that my drug that is now in early preclinical development will actually result in in an approved NDA 17 years from now is only 5%. Multiplying these together, the net present value of a dollar’s revenue in the first year of drug approval is one cent today. Phrased differently, it takes a hundred dollars of drug revenue 17 years from now to motivate someone to invest one dollar today. &lt;em&gt;No wonder drugs are expensive&lt;/em&gt;. If they weren’t, there wouldn’t be any new drugs. At least not unless a whole lot changed, and you can clone my Google Spreadsheet and play with it yourself to get a sense of just how much the assumptions would need to change to really alter that calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some drugs are expected to be so cheap and quick to develop, so likely to succeed, so expensive, and/or so widely prescribed, that they actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; generate a hundred dollars seventeen years from now for every dollar invested today, and those are the drugs that we see in the world around us. But under the assumptions in my purely hypothetical Google Spreadsheet model, the effect of this one-cent-on-the-dollar reality is that a profitable drug becomes rather unprofitable. Here is the annual costs and revenues plot with the heights of the bars adjusted for the discount rate and probability of reaching each year of the development pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cureffi.org/media/2019/04/npv-adjusted.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can tell at a glance that the area of the red bars is much greater than the area of the black bars — with lag time and risk accounted for, developing the drug is now expected to result in a net loss of $15 million in today’s dollars. So this spreadsheet represents a drug that would not end up being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if that’s the drug for your disease? What can you do about this? In the rest of this post, I will try to understand the major factors that go into each of the four principal variables in the model — revenue, cost, lag time, and probability of success — because therein might lie a mandate for what patient organizations and patient-scientists need to do in order to transform an impossible disease into a “developable” one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;revenue&quot;&gt;revenue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue is the money a company is going to make by selling a drug. At a first pass, this is the price of the drug times the number of people that take it. A few key variables here are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective disease prevalence.&lt;/strong&gt; At issue is not the incidence (rate at which new cases are diagnosed) nor the lifetime risk (proportion of people that ever develop the disease), but rather the point prevalence (number of patients at any given moment). In fact, it’s really the number of &lt;em&gt;potentially treatable&lt;/em&gt; patients alive at any given time. This may therefore exclude patients who haven’t yet been diagnosed, and patients who are already too advanced. Thus, the long diagnostic odyssey we see in many diseases isn’t just frustrating for the patient and their family, it also means that &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; there are fewer treatable patients out there, and therefore, pharma companies will be less attracted to invest in the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market share.&lt;/strong&gt; Of the potentially treatable patients alive at any given time, how many will take the drug? Even if your drug is the first-ever drug for a previously untreatable disease, the market share is still not going to be 100%. Getting the drug to patients depends upon physician prescribing behavior and insurance company reimbursement. It also always has a run-up period as physicians and payors become aware of the drug — new drugs don’t reach high market share overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price.&lt;/strong&gt; The average annual price per patient. This often needs to take into account the patient compliance rate (how often do people actually fill their prescriptions). I would like to think that in rare, severe diseases the compliance rate is very high, making this a non-factor, but I haven’t seen any data and there may be exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might patients be able to do to push these factors in the right direction? Raising awareness of your disease isn’t just feel-good stuff: if you can convince doctors to test for this disease sooner or more often, or convince patients to seek testing, or convince people at risk to sign up for a registry, you are increasing the &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; disease prevalence (and without making the terrible disease itself more common). Anything you can do to improve diagnosis, whether it’s establishing referral networks, making testing available, establishing biobanks or datasets to help scientists validate diagnostic tests, could also help promote earlier and better diagnosis, thus boosting effective prevalence. Another issue is that, for many diseases, there simply aren’t good data out there on prevalence — cases are seen here and there and no one has undertaken a comprehensive epidemiological effort to figure out how many there are in total. Such a lack of information may make the financial modelers more inclined to be conservative (although to be fair, I’ve also heard some say that the prevalence once you have a drug usually turns out to be higher than what people thought it was when the disease was untreatable, because a drug motivates doctors and patients to pursue diagnosis). Any work you can do to figure out the prevalence of your disease — pulling together case series, estimating genetic prevalence based on public datasets, and so on — might help in establishing that the disease is prevalent enough to be “developable”. Finally, having a strong patient network and advocacy group is key: you want to make sure would-be drug developers understand that if and when a drug is approved, your patient organization will be on the ground making sure every last eligible patient gets the drug and takes it, and that their insurance companies pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costs include everything a company puts into developing, producing, testing, and selling a drug. The nature and amount of costs vary a lot by the phase of the project [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256615&quot; title=&quot;Morgan S, Grootendorst P, Lexchin J, Cunningham C, Greyson D. The cost of drug development: a systematic review. Health Policy. 2011 Apr;100(1):4-17. doi: 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.12.002. Epub 2011 Jan 21. Review. PubMed PMID: 21256615.&quot;&gt;Morgan 2011&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26928437&quot; title=&quot;DiMasi JA, Grabowski HG, Hansen RW. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&amp;amp;D costs. J Health Econ. 2016 May;47:20-33. doi: 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012. Epub 2016 Feb 12. PubMed PMID: 26928437.&quot;&gt;DiMasi 2016&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preclinical development costs.&lt;/strong&gt; These are the costs of inventing the drug and bringing it to the point of being ready for human testing. Depending on the type of drug, this could start from screening small molecule libraries or raising and humanizing an antibody; regardless, it probably ends with Good Laboratory Practices toxicity studies to enable Phase I. I have sometimes heard the claim that preclinical costs pale in comparison to clinical-phase costs, but I have yet to see data to back this up. In the Tufts study of drug development costs [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26928437&quot; title=&quot;DiMasi JA, Grabowski HG, Hansen RW. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&amp;amp;D costs. J Health Econ. 2016 May;47:20-33. doi: 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012. Epub 2016 Feb 12. PubMed PMID: 26928437.&quot;&gt;DiMasi 2016&lt;/a&gt;], pre-human costs were just under half as much as clinical costs in out-of-pocket terms. But because preclinical costs are incurred earlier, they inflate more when you apply a discount rate, and so the “capitalized” costs for preclinical development were actually almost as high as for clinical development. Rather than preclinical costs being negligible, I think the truth is just that they are very hard to estimate. Many people won’t even bother to do any modeling until they are ready to move to the clinical stage. In the spreadsheet I have used the simplistic approach of modeling preclinical costs based on a guess of how many staff with what salaries will be busy doing preclinical development for how many years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical development costs.&lt;/strong&gt; Models for clinical trials are basically cost per patient times number of patients, in each phase, plus some multiplier to account for salaries and other internal costs that the company must bear. Note that if your disease is rare, your trials are by necessity small, which — provided they’re still feasible and well-powered — is actually an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-approval costs.&lt;/strong&gt; Detailed models might include a lot of things that are both boring and that you have no control over, like the pharma company’s overhead rate, the cost of hiring a sales team to sell the drug, the costs of chemical synthesis or biological production, the distribution cold chain, and so on. There may also be royalty or IP costs. A common model is that the company (usually a major pharma) conducting clinical trials and eventually marketing the drug didn’t invent the drug — instead, they are partnered with, or licensing IP from, a biotech startup or an academic medical center that helped develop the drug. Therefore, from the pharma company’s perspective these partnership or licensing deals come through as a cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all these different costs, what can patients exert any influence over? The biggest potential area that I see is to push on clinical trial size and duration. From the patient perspective, you may be thinking you want large trials because you want every patient in your community to have the chance to enroll, but what you want even more is small, quick, efficient trials that result in the drug being approved swiftly so that then everyone can take it, and this latter goal dovetails with the need for trials to be small enough to be feasible even if your disease is rare, and affordable enough for a company to bother investing in developing the drug in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are usually designed to have a certain level of statistical power, and while power calculations themselves require myriad assumptions, a general rule is that you need more patients if the trial outcome takes longer to observe, or if underlying variability between patients is greater. Developing good, robust, measurable outcomes for your disease — whether clinical outcomes (things like FEV1 in cystic fibrosis, 6-minute walk test in muscular dystrophy) or biomarker outcomes — and identifying homogeneous patient populations (subsets of patients in which presentation and progression are similar) might do a lot to lower the clinical trial size. Both of these are goals you could pursue by organizing natural history studies that collect patients and observe the presentation and progression of disease under the current no-drug status quo. Such studies would be run by a clinical investigator at an academic medical center, but might rely heavily on patient groups to refer patients, raise funds, and provide input on study design and outcomes that patients care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different instinct that we’ve certainly had, and that I’ve heard from other activated patients as well, is that one can make a drug development program more appealing by coming with a therapeutic lead in hand and thus shaving off time and costs from the preclinical development stage. Whether this idea holds water will inevitably depend upon the specifics of your disease biology and proposed therapeutic modality, so I don’t know that there is any generalizable rule, but I will share a few things I’ve come to realize. One is that if you launch an academic or biotech effort to find a lead, you have to consider your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; discount rate and probability of success — what else could you have done with those dollars and years — and your odds may not turn out to be better than an established company investing in this space, particularly if the latter could leverage an existing discovery pipeline and in-house expertise rather than starting from scratch. Then there’s the question of if you fail and end up with no lead, what will you learn? Sometimes the answer is a lot, sometimes it’s nothing — it all depends on the disease specifics — but I’ll at least flag that there often exists a risk of types of failures that one cannot learn much from, whereas the benefits from natural history studies and other areas you can invest in (see above and below) might be more predictable. Finally, depending on the terms (be they dictated by venture capital or by university IP licensing rules) under which your preclinical discovery work is done, even if you do find a promising lead it may not appear to potential pharma partners as a free lunch — in some cases the laws of economics may dictate that it costs them as much, or a significant fraction as much, to license the IP as it would have cost to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lag-time&quot;&gt;lag time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key variable in lag time is the time from when the first dollar is spent until the drug is approved. The reality is just slightly more complicated, of course. There are multiple regions with different regulatory agencies, so approval is not a monolith. How lag time is distributed within different stages of the development pipeline also matters a bit, since discounting affects costs as well as revenues. And another temporal factor is the duration of market exclusivity after approval. But all of these are details — the key question is when will the drug be approved, and how much is a dollar in that year worth today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth taking a brief aside to talk about discount rates. Why is the discount rate in my model 8% even though I’m certainly not earning 8% on my personal savings account and inflation is nowhere near 8% right now? Discount rates are determined by the expected yield from whatever someone — and imagine here a very financially sophisticated someone — could do with the money if not investing it in this drug. Maybe they’d invest it in a different drug, or in startups in a different sector, or in real estate, the details don’t matter, but to the people who possess the staggering amounts of money required to make a drug, there are many potential investment routes that would yield an 8% annual return. Indeed, if anything I think most finance folks and economists would object that my discount rate is too low. 8% is a figure I often saw used in public policy circles (my Master’s degrees are in city planning and transportation engineering) for evaluating public-sector investments in infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s not much one can do to change discount rate, so what can one do to change the lag time? Here, again, my take is that the key thing to push on is clinical trial duration. Particularly in rare diseases, there can be opportunities to compress or combine trial phases. Scientifically, what is required might be good biomarkers and/or good clinical outcome measurements, and finding those might require natural history studies, biobanks, and registries, all things that patient groups can help to catalyze by funding, advising, and/or getting multiple investigators to collaborate with each other. Figuring out how to actually leverage those tools to expedite trials might involve a conversation with regulators, and there are increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/PatientEngagement/default.htm&quot;&gt;many opportunities&lt;/a&gt; for patients to have these sorts of conversations with FDA, distinct from the types of meetings available to pharmaceutical companies as drug sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;probability-of-success&quot;&gt;probability of success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest hit that the model takes, even bigger than discounting, is the risk, or rather, likelihood, that the drug fails. In industry parlance, the variable in question here is “probability of technical and regulatory success” (PTRS). As noted above, published data show that in the aggregate, PTRS from the time a drug enters Phase I is only about ten percent [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406927&quot; title=&quot;Hay M, Thomas DW, Craighead JL, Economides C, Rosenthal J. Clinical development success rates for investigational drugs. Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Jan;32(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2786. PubMed PMID: 24406927.&quot;&gt;Hay 2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26928437&quot; title=&quot;DiMasi JA, Grabowski HG, Hansen RW. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&amp;amp;D costs. J Health Econ. 2016 May;47:20-33. doi: 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012. Epub 2016 Feb 12. PubMed PMID: 26928437.&quot;&gt;DiMasi 2016&lt;/a&gt;]. This is broken down by success rates at each phase, because early failures (when you haven’t yet spent on a Phase III trial) are less costly than late stage failures. Absent any data to make a more informed assumption, these sorts of aggregate statistics are a good starting point for a model, and I’ve used the phase-wise probabilities from [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406927&quot; title=&quot;Hay M, Thomas DW, Craighead JL, Economides C, Rosenthal J. Clinical development success rates for investigational drugs. Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Jan;32(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2786. PubMed PMID: 24406927.&quot;&gt;Hay 2014&lt;/a&gt;] in my spreadsheet. But the probabilities can differ a lot depending on indication (apparently infectious disease has the best success rate and oncology the poorest), modality (monoclonal antibodies fare better than small molecules), and many other factors [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406927&quot; title=&quot;Hay M, Thomas DW, Craighead JL, Economides C, Rosenthal J. Clinical development success rates for investigational drugs. Nat Biotechnol. 2014 Jan;32(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2786. PubMed PMID: 24406927.&quot;&gt;Hay 2014&lt;/a&gt;]. For any one program, given the specifics of the drug, the disease biology, the patient population and so on, modelers may well feel inclined to assume that the probability of success is higher or lower than the average. What can you do to convince them (and moreover, to be &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; in convincing them) that the probability is higher than average for your disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the magic word I have heard over and over again from people in the industry is &lt;em&gt;de-risk&lt;/em&gt;. You may not be able to do much about drugs that fail on safety — that’s really the company’s job — but many drug candidates fail on efficacy, and this is where both the fundamental science of your disease, and the tools used to study it, really matter a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mandate is to be dead certain about the therapeutic hypothesis. What causes the disease? What is the molecular target and the mechanism of action that you want a potential drug to have? What benefit do you expect that mechanism of action to yield — in what group of patients at what disease stage after what duration of treatment? These are the fundamentals without which drug development is a shot in the dark. And crazily enough, sometimes drug companies &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take shots in the dark — but usually only for very common indications (think Alzheimer’s disease) where the potential upside is so astronomical as to outweigh a probability of success that is yet much lower than the already-low average of 10%. The rarer your disease is, the less you can afford the risk that the therapeutic hypothesis isn’t even right in the first place. For many diseases, the therapeutic hypothesis is already clear — I am grateful every day that Sonia and I were born late enough to completely miss the debate over whether prion disease was caused by a virus, and to have come to our mission knowing with certainty that it is caused by prion protein. But in a disease where the therapeutic hypothesis is not yet clear, that is the paramount area to invest in. And whereas therapeutic lead molecules may come and go, disease mechanism is forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second mandate is to develop tools for drug development. This is likely to include registries and good referral networks and so on, to make sure you can find the patients when you need them and you don’t fail for lack of enrollment. It is also likely to include (again) clinical tools like biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments and natural history datasets. These can help you make sure a trial is well-designed and adequately statistically powered. Consider for example the power of a pharmacodynamic biomarker (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cureffi.org/2019/04/04/measuring-prp-in-spinal-fluid-two-different-ways/&quot;&gt;concept introduced here&lt;/a&gt;), which can read out whether a drug is having the molecular effect that you expect. While such a marker does not directly tell you whether the drug is affecting the disease state, it at least tells you if the drug it hitting its target (target engagement) and can help you find the right dose. Similarly, a good clinical outcome measure might allow you to at least get a whiff of efficacy (or lack thereof), from early small trials to help make go/no-go decisions before reaching costly large trials. Without these sorts of tools, you’re flying blind all the way into the most expensive trial stages. A situation that is likely to scare drug companies off is when the only way to have any idea whether the drug is doing anything in people is to wait all the way until the end of a large, long Phase III. Depending on the disease, this “developing tools” mandate might also include whatever preclinical tools might be likely to be predictive of clinical success. In some diseases, that might be patient cell lines, in others it may be mouse models, in others you don’t know yet what preclinical tools will turn out to be useful, but you probably still want some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone wants to become a scientist at the bench like we did, but a lot of motivated patients contribute in a lot of different ways to advancing therapeutics for their own diseases — whether through advocacy, organizing the patient community, organizing the researcher community, fundraising and betting on different investigators and scientific approaches, or myriad other ways. A lot of these are things we work on too in addition to our science at the bench. In the seven years we’ve been at it, we’ve come to see more of the big picture of what makes a disease “developable”. From my initial attitude of “we have to find a drug” we’ve shifted more towards thinking “we have to &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; a drug”. A lot of drug companies and biotechs have profound expertise in finding a drug, expertise that we would be hard-pressed to match in our academic lab, whereas they are not experts in our disease. Our interactions with industry and understanding what they look for have shaped what we think are the priorities for us to accomplish, and I now see that a lot of that is reflected in the financial model here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I’ve started to think about it is by an analogy to pistachios — see the photo at the top of this post. What I’m about to say does not apply to really truly ultra-rare conditions, where exceptionally creative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atcp.org/a-t-child-and-oligo-selected-for-aso-gene-therapy/&quot;&gt;“N of 1” approaches&lt;/a&gt; may be required, but I think it applies to diseases as rare as prion disease and probably even a bit rarer. Even in pretty rare diseases, from a pharma company’s perspective, a drug can always be priced for more than it costs to manufacture and distribute, so every potential drug would be profitable, if only success were certain and instantaneous. The jeopardy lies in whether the revenues are so much larger than the costs as to offset the years and years of lag time and overwhelming likelihood of failure. Every pistachio has a delicious nut at its center, the question is whether that nut is bursting out of the shell or barely visible through the tiniest seam. One way to think about our job as activated patients is that we need to pry our disease open, and make it an easy nut to pluck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give just one final example of how my interactons with industry have shaped my thinking, the other day I was speaking with someone at a startup that had a very specific technology applicable to just one specific class of genes. They had founded a company based on this new technology, and only later circled back to figuring out exactly which target(s) within this class they wanted to go after. I asked what the thought process had been for deciding on a target. They said they pulled a list of all the genes their technology could target, then intersected it with a list of disease genes. They then spent a few days Googling each gene on the intersected list and taking notes. The criteria? They asked which genes had a rock-solid biological link between the gene and a severe disease, along with a well-organized patient community and registry. As a bonus, it helped if the disease also had at least some progress on assembling clinical cohorts, documenting natural history, and characterizing biomarkers. Those criteria were enough to narrow the field down to three genes, all of which the company was pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of that conversation not infrequently, thinking to myself, &lt;em&gt;who knows&lt;/em&gt; what other technologies are out there, what other patents haven’t been published yet, what other startups are still in stealth mode, who is out there Googling a list of ten or a hundred genes to figure out which is “developable”. When they Google &lt;em&gt;PRNP&lt;/em&gt;, my job is to make sure they say, now &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a gene we can go after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of caveats to everything in this post. Every disease is different in its biology, its clinical picture, and how much is already known or has already been accomplished by researchers in the field. Prion disease is really my focus, and there will certainly be unconscious assumptions that I’ve made here that won’t always apply elsewhere. I’m not an expert in anyone else’s disease, but I wrote this post in the hope that, once you get done ignoring everything here that just doesn’t apply, there still might be lessons left that are generalizably useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Finished project first! I decided sometime last year that I wanted to make a smart watch from scratch. I am an electrical engineer and product designer by day, so this was a fun side project that had been rolling around in my head for a while now. Also, this project is full open sourced, the below repo has all of the build files you would need to make your own: - Circuit board files - Schematics - Bill of Materials - All the code - STL files for all the prints github.com/S-March/smarchWatch_PUBLIC I hope you guys enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;n7U0zQW&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Another glamour shot of the finished watch. This is what the time looks like when you raise your wrist. I decided a background of leaves/flowers went nice with the wood* housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;Dn2HZKw&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, on to the design! First up, this is a quick gif of the top side of the watch being designed in Fusion 360. The program is free for hobbyist and is definitely powerful enough for anything I needed. I tried openSCAD for an earlier version of the watch, and although I liked it, it just couldn't compete with this. I decided early on that I wanted a round watch. I'm not a fan of the square or squarcle watches that seem to be all over these days. Something about that shape felt too 1980's computer-y to me. From a technical point of view, it is definitely easier to make something that isn't round. Square screens are much easier to come by and have more space to show you more stuff. The reality, however, is I don't want another phone or computer on my wrist. I just want something to show me important bits of information when I need them. The shape of this particular watch was primarily driven by the screen I ended up using (which can be found in the bill of materials). It is a teardrop shape, where the actual display is round, but there are some additional electronics parts that add to the size. So you can see above, the square parts on the top and bottom where the band connects to the watch are actually there to hide the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;sgMUql8&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the bottom part of the watch. You can see the cutouts inside for the battery, vibration motor and charging pins. There are also two small holes that are used for screwing the circuit board down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;8o2VrJJ&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;A rendered version of the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;5CCSVml&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;A rendered version of the bottom. Note the yellow piece on the right hand side. That is the screen connector. It folds over itself and plugs into the circuit board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;coFd7Xb&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Another quick render of the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;x8KDOcU&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, on to the fun stuff! I have a little cheap monoprice printer here at home, it is awesome for stuff like this. I printed out the two pieces of the housing I designed above out of a woodfill PLA. What that means, is that the plastic I used to print this out, is actually 70% plastic and 30% saw dust. The cool thing about woodfill plastic, is that it behaves very similarly to actual wood. It sands down really nicely and you can stain it with wood stains! The downside to this particular type of plastic is that when it prints, it leaves a stringy mess on the print that you have to clean up. I use a file and some 220 grit sandpaper to get it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;4KJgRMu&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up is just a quick test to make sure the screen and the watch glass fit nicely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;0M3xIil&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here are the three stages of the 3D print. Bottom left is fresh off the printer, you can see the stringy mess I was talking about. The middle is a sanded down print. And the top right is after the sanded print has been dunked in a dark walnut stain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;bfm6AVL&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The next 9 pictures may be a little boring if you have no interest in the actual electronics of the smart watch (you can feel free to skip them). If you are curious as to what makes this thing tick, I will do my absolute best to describe everything in a non-technical way. When designing a schematic (think blueprints) for any sort of electronics, I try to break down all my big parts of the design into smaller blocks. This first page of the schematics is what I call the &quot;Main&quot; page. All it is, is a quick overview of the blocks that make this watch work, and how they connect to each other. So as you can see, in this particular design there are four blocks: The power block - this is the section that deals with the battery and making sure the watch has power The sensors block - this what tells the watch what is going on around it (think eyes and ears) The actuators block - this is the part of the watch that interacts with the world (think moving parts, like your legs or arms) The BLE block - this is the section that controls the whole thing, it is the brains of the operation. I probably should have labeled this better, but it was originally just meant for my eyes only. BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, it is the same bluetooth that is in your phones. If people are more interested in how the electronics actually work, I can add a more detailed explanation of these next few pictures. I will link to it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;RTHzzQO&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;First up, the power block. As you can see, just like in the last picture, I try to break down things into smaller and smaller pieces. For this particular block, we don't need much. We need the battery itself, the charger contacts, and some protection for the battery. Whenever we work with lithium ion batteries (the same type that are in almost anything rechargeable), we have to be very careful. The batteries themselves pack a lot of energy into something very small. If they short circuit or are damaged in any way, they can blow up with in a matter of seconds. The battery protection block on this page just makes sure the battery is never over-charged, under-charged or short circuited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;6zYNFZG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Second, the sensors. This particular design only has one extra sensor: an accelerometer. All an accelerometer does is measure, you guessed it, acceleration. If you remember back to your high school physics class days, you may recall that gravity is actually just a downwards acceleration. So with that in mind, if you can measure which way is down, you can figure out which direction the watch is pointing (up/down/left/right/front/back). And if we know which direction the watch is facing, then we can design the watch to only turn the screen on when you hold the watch up and its facing you. You may notice the other block in this section (I2C pullups). I2C stands for inter-intergrated circuit, all it is, is a way for chips to talk to one another. The pullups are just to make sure the I2C communications work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ufXmfBx&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The actuators section is dedicated entirely to ways the watch can interact with the world around it, in this case the screen and the vibration motor. The screen is an LCD (liquid crystal display) which is the same as a lot of phones and TVs. It is 240 pixels tall by 240 pixels wide. What this means is there are 240x240 individually controlled colored dots on a big grid. Think of it like those kids toys (lite-brites), where you can plug in different colored dots to make a picture. That is all this display is doing. The vibration motor is exactly what it sounds like, a motor that vibrates. This is used to let me know when I get a new notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;YfsBpGR&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the meat and potatoes of the watch. The Dialog Semiconductor DA14683 chip. It is a microcontroller (the brain) and it has bluetooth built in to it! There is some additional memory on the circuit board so that the watch can store pictures (people in my contacts, backgrounds, etc.). And what is called a pi-network for the antenna. I won't get into the details of the antenna stuff here, but even for most electrical engineers this stuff is black magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;TB7X2RK&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The next four pictures are the actual circuit board. This is where we take the schematic, and all the blocks we designed and make them into physical board. Circuit boards are made up of two things: copper and fiberglass. The copper is the part that makes the electrical connections between all the parts. So for example, the microcontroller (brain) is connected to the accelerometer over a copper trace (thin line of copper). But sometimes, you can manage to connect everything without needing to cross over another trace. Think of this like a maze, where if you touch the side, everything short-circuits. So what we can do is connect multiple layers of copper and stack them on top of one another (with fiberglass in between). That way we can have a trace that connects the microcontroller to the memory without having to cross the path of the vibration motor. This first picture is the &quot;top&quot; layer of the circuit board, it has stuff like the microcontroller and the memory on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uFNteg0&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This next picture is the second layer from the top. It is just used to connect stuff. No parts can go here since it is sandwiched in between fiberglass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;aasQjLV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the third layer, similar to the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;kgKchci&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the bottom layer of the circuit board. On this side, we can put more parts, so things like the battery and vibration motor are all connected here. That concludes the boring electrical stuff. Back to the fun build pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;0aEOEVA&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, welcome back to the people that skipped over the boring stuff! This is the finished circuit board. After I finished the design, I put all the files together and sent them over to a PCB manufacturer. They then take those files and print (with a super high resolution printer) on to some copper. They can then etch away the copper that isn't used and voila! Circuit boards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uebRGfV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;After getting the circuit board I just did a quick fit check with the printed parts from before. The bottom part of the watch is the part that holds the circuit board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;tOZJHdo&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Then the top part of the watch just presses down on to that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;RI2XoyG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Once the circuit board checked out size-wise, it was time to put all the chips and stuff on. I unfortunately forgot to get a cool time-lapse of this process, so the gif below is me assembling an older version of the smart watch that didn't have a screen. At least it will give you an idea of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;GCHzeyM&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is how assembling a circuit boards works. First, in addition to the actual bare circuit board, it helps to have a stencil made. The stencil will have cutouts for solder paste. This goop is, in essence, tiny beads of solder that are suspended in a paste. So, once you have your circuit board, put in on a flat surface (I like to tape it down so it doesn't move). Next, tape the stencil on top. Spread the solder past out with something like an old credit card. After all the holes in the stencil are filled with the paste, take the stencil off (very carefully). Then, the fun part, using tweezers, pick up and put down all the little chips and parts on the board. Once all the parts are on the board, un-tape the circuit board, and pop it in the reflow oven (basically a fancy toaster oven) for about 8 minutes. All those tiny beads of solder will melt and turn into solid metal connections holding everything in place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ypRp4mt&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up, the actual assembly! The board gets screwed down into the bottom housing. Those two golden squares at the top with the holes in them are the charging pads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uvETY3T&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up the glass and screen are placed into the top housing. A nice snug fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;PhQNpXk&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Connecting the screen to the circuit board is as simple plugging it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;tM8hO92&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Last but not least, flip the top part over and press it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;8ckcVR4&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Because who doesn't love a short gif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;GPQdxF4&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is the final thing all buttoned up and coded. When I raise my wrist, it shows the time. I won't bore people with the running through the code (there is a LOT of it). If people want to know more about it, I can add a more detailed review and link it here. A quick summary of some of the things I had to do: - Get bluetooth working and talking to my phone - Implement an Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) so that my phone would forward notifications to my watch - Get the microcontroller to talk to the screen (this took SO long) - Get the screen to display pixels - Design animations for the screen - Get the microcontroller talking to the memory - Write a windows program to open a folder of pictures on my desktop, crop them to a square, downsize them to 240x240 pixels, convert them to a bitmap, strip out the bitmap header, change the endianness of the bytes, put all the data into one long hex file and then transmit that hex file over UART to the watch - Write a function to take the picture data from the UART stream, and put it into memory with offsets that were readily available - Hand draw a 240 by 240 picture that contained all letters and numbers in upper and lower case, then get the microcontroller to slice that image up depending on which letter or number it needed to display (so if you wanted to right &quot;HELLO&quot; it would find the &quot;H&quot; in the picture, send it to the screen, then find the &quot;E&quot; do the same thing, etc.) - Get the accelerometer to wake up the microcontroller only when the wrist was in the right position so it used minimal battery power - Write a contacts function that would parse the notification for who the sender was and return the offset in memory of where their contact picture was - Many many more things...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;PknL3xV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;BONUS CONTENT!!! You thought I would stop at just a watch?! Nope, had to make a charging cradle for it too! Here is a quick gif of how it assembles. I designed another small circuit board that has a micro-USB plug and some spring contacts. When the watch is laid into the cradle a big magnet holds it in place and the spring contacts send power to the watch to charge the battery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;w9pMIve&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is the magnet pulling the watch into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Finish the whole thing up with the same glamour shots from earlier! This is what the watch looks like when I get a notification. First it shows a picture of who the message is from (along with what application) followed by the message itself. That is me sending a text to myself from google voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;7Ham6j8&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta post-image-meta--last&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Hope you guys liked it. I know it is a lot of really technical info, but I had an absolute blast making the watch (and I think it came out pretty nice looking)! The github link at the top has all of the circuit files, bill of materials, schematic, code, and STLs if you want to make your own!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Key points:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Privacy International have today published a report &lt;strong&gt;entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacyinternational.org/report/1699/digital-stop-and-search-how-uk-police-can-secretly-download-everything-your-mobile&quot;&gt;'Digital Stop and search: how the UK police can secretly download everything from your mobile phone'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, based on Freedom of Information requests to 47 police forces across the UK about their use of 'mobile phone extraction' technologies, which enable them to download all the content and data from a mobile phone.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Police forces across the UK are secretly downloading data from the smartphones of people across the UK, including phones belonging to people not convicted of any crime, and even phones belonging to witnesses and victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Police forces are not obtaining warrants, or seeking permission from people whose phones they search, and neither are they operating within any clear legal framework, meaning that these powers enable discriminatory policing to go unnoticed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What the police are doing is potentially unlawful and Privacy International is seeking urgent answers from the Home Office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;David Lammy MP, author of the Lammy Review, has welcomed the report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Privacy International have today published a new report examining technology UK police forces are secretly deploying, which enables them to download all of the content and data from people's phones. 'Digital Stop and search: how the UK police can secretly download everything from your mobile phone' is based on Freedom of Information requests to 47 police forces across the UK about their use of such 'mobile phone extraction' technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For over six years police forces throughout the UK have secretly been deploying highly intrusive technology that allows them to gather vast amounts of data on individuals in the UK, including those convicted of no crime, witnesses and victims. Contracting with notorious companies such as Cellebrite, UK police forces are able to use sophisticated tools to take all data from your phone, including hidden and deleted data. This includes data about your friends, family and colleagues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Privacy International have exposed a potentially unlawful regime operating with forces who are confused about the legal basis for the technology they are using. The police are acting without clear safeguards for the public, and no independent oversight to identify abuse and misuse of sensitive personal information. Seen in the light of ongoing issues of discrimination within the criminal justice system, this presents a serious cause for concern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Data can be taken from victims, witnesses and suspects without informing them. With no clear policies or guidance on the use of this technology, individuals are unaware of their legal rights in terms of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Whether data is only taken when necessary and proportionate;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Getting the police to delete this data when there is no legal reason to retain it, particularly if they are innocent of any crime;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ensuring data is held securely to prevent exposure of their personal data as a result of loss of records, misuse or security breach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Key statistics:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;26 out of 47 police forces (55%) that we submitted Freedom of Information requests to admitted they are using mobile phone extraction technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Out of the remaining 21 police forces (45%):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Eight police forces (17%) have trialed or intend to trial this technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Thirteen police forces (28%) either failed to respond to our questions or stated they hold no information on the use of this technology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Key recommendations from our report:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Privacy International's report 'Digital Stop and Search’ includes eleven key recommendations including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There needs to be an urgent independent review into this widespread, intrusive but secretive practice;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There should be a requirement for police to obtain a warrant for searching the contents of a mobile phone, issued on the basis of reasonable suspicion;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Home Office must publish guidance for the public, regarding their rights if the police want to search their mobile phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Millie Graham Wood, Solicitor, Privacy International, said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&quot;You could search a person, and their entire home, and never find anywhere near as much information as you could from searching their phone. Yet the police can take data from your phone without your consent, without your knowledge and without a warrant. It is disturbing that the police have such a highly draconian power, operating in secret, without any accountability to the public. Given the serious problems we still face in the UK with discriminatory policing, we need to urgently address how this new frontier of policing might be disproportionately and unfairly impacting on minority ethnic groups, political demonstrators, environmental activists and many other groups that can find themselves in the crosshairs of the police.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The police are continually failing to be transparent with the thousands of people whose phones they are secretly downloading data from. An immediate independent review into this practice should be initiated by the Home Office and College of Policing, with widespread consultation with the public, to find the right balance of powers for the police and protections for the public. Let's be clear - at the moment, the police have all the power and the public have no protections.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;David Lammy, MP for Tottenham and author of the 2017 Lammy Review into the treatment of, and outcomes for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system, said of Privacy International's report:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&quot;The lack of transparency around new policing tools such as mobile phone extraction is a serious cause for concern. There are no records, no statistics, no safeguards, no oversight and no clear statement of the rights that citizens have if their mobile phone is confiscated and searched by the police. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;My Review of our criminal justice system found that individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds still face bias in parts of our justice system, and it is only because we have transparency and data collection for everything from stop and search incidents to crown court sentencing decisions that these disparities are revealed and we are able to hold those in power to account. Without the collection and audit of data about the use of mobile phone extraction powers scrutiny will be impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Given the sensitive nature and wealth of information stored on our mobile phones there is significant risk of abuse and for conscious or unconscious bias to become a factor without independent scrutiny and in the absence of effective legal safeguards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We entrust so much personal information to our phones that the police having the power to download every message and photo we have sent or received without any rights and protections is another worrying example of regulations not keeping up with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;advances in technology.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;-Ends-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
