&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Insects around the world are in a crisis, according to a small but growing number of long-term studies showing dramatic declines in invertebrate populations. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1722477115&quot;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the problem is more widespread than scientists realized. Huge numbers of bugs have been lost in a pristine national forest in Puerto Rico, the study found, and the forest’s insect-eating animals have gone missing, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;In 2014, an international team of biologists estimated that, in the past 35 years, the abundance of invertebrates such as beetles and bees had &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6195/401.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;decreased by 45 percent&lt;/a&gt;. In places where long-term insect data are available, mainly in Europe, insect numbers are plummeting. A study last year showed a 76 percent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/10/18/this-is-very-alarming-flying-insects-vanish-from-nature-preserves/?utm_term=.646ed11d4999&quot;&gt;decrease in flying insects&lt;/a&gt; in the past few decades in German nature preserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The latest report, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that this startling loss of insect abundance extends to the Americas. The study’s authors implicate climate change in the loss of tropical invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;“This study in PNAS is a real wake-up call — a clarion call — that the phenomenon could be much, much bigger, and across many more ecosystems,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/dwagner/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, an expert in invertebrate conservation at the University of Connecticut who was not involved with this research. He added: “This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.rpi.edu/biology/faculty/brad-lister&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.rpi.edu/biology/faculty/brad-lister&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lister&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, has been studying rain forest insects in Puerto Rico since the 1970s. If Puerto Rico is the island of enchantment — “la isla del encanto” — then its rain forest is “the enchanted forest on the enchanted isle,” he said. Birds and coqui frogs trill beneath a 50-foot-tall emerald canopy. The forest, named El Yunque, is well-protected. Spanish King Alfonso XII claimed the jungle as a 19th-century royal preserve. Decades later, Theodore Roosevelt made it a national reserve, and El Yunque remains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/elyunque/about-forest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only tropical rain forest&lt;/a&gt; in the National Forest system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;“We went down in ’76, ’77 expressly to measure the resources: the insects and the insectivores in the rain forest, the birds, the frogs, the lizards,” Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;He came back nearly 40 years later, with his colleague Andrés García, an ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. What the scientists did not see on their return troubled them. “Boy, it was immediately obvious when we went into that forest,” Lister said. Fewer birds flitted overhead. The butterflies, once abundant, had all but vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;García and Lister once again measured the forest’s insects and other invertebrates, a group called arthropods that includes spiders and centipedes. The researchers trapped arthropods on the ground in plates covered in a sticky glue, and raised several more plates about three feet into the canopy. The researchers also swept nets over the brush hundreds of times, collecting the critters that crawled through the vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Each technique revealed the biomass (the dry weight of all the captured invertebrates) had significantly decreased from 1976 to the present day. The sweep sample biomass decreased to a fourth or an eighth of what it had been. Between January 1977 and January 2013, the catch rate in the sticky ground traps fell 60-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;“Everything is dropping,” Lister said. The most common invertebrates in the rain forest — the moths, the butterflies, the grasshoppers, the spiders and others — are all far less abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;“Holy crap,” Wagner said of the 60-fold loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Louisiana State University entomologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lsuagcenter.com/profiles/tschowalter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Timothy Schowalter&lt;/a&gt;, who is not an author of the recent report, has studied this forest since the 1990s. The new research is consistent with his data, as well as the European biomass studies. “It takes these long-term sites, with consistent sampling across a long period of time, to document these trends,” he said. “I find their data pretty compelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;The study authors also trapped anole lizards, which eat arthropods, in the rain forest. They compared these numbers with counts from the 1970s. Anole biomass dropped by more than 30 percent. Some anole species have altogether disappeared from the interior forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Insect-eating frogs and birds plummeted, too. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://luq.lter.network/data/luqmetadata173&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; used mist nets to capture birds in 1990, and again in 2005. Captures fell by about 50 percent. Garcia and Lister analyzed the data with an eye on the insectivores. The ruddy quail dove, which eats fruits and seeds, had no population change. A brilliant green bird called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/Species-Account/nb/species/purtod1/overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Puerto Rican tody&lt;/a&gt;, which eats bugs almost exclusively, diminished by 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;The food web appears to have been obliterated from the bottom. It’s credible that the authors link the cascade to arthropod loss, Schowalter said, because “you have all these different taxa showing the same trends — the insectivorous birds, frogs and lizards — but you don’t see those among seed-feeding birds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;Lister and Garcia attribute this crash to climate. In the same 40-year period as the arthropod crash, the average high temperature in the rain forest increased by 4 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperatures in the tropics stick to a narrow band. The invertebrates that live there, likewise, are adapted to these temperatures and fare poorly outside them; bugs cannot regulate their internal heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;A recent analysis of climate change and insects, published in August in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6405/916&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;journal Science&lt;/a&gt;, predicts a decrease in tropical insect populations, according to an author of that study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvm.edu/gund/profiles/scott-merrill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scott Merrill&lt;/a&gt;, who studies crop pests at the University of Vermont. In temperate regions farther from the equator, where insects can survive a wider range of temperatures, agricultural pests will devour more food as their metabolism increases, Merrill and his co-authors warned. But after a certain thermal threshold, insects will no longer lay eggs, he said, and their internal chemistry breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;The authors of a 2017 study of vanished flying insects in Germany suggested other possible culprits, including pesticides and habitat loss. Arthropods around the globe also have to contend with pathogens and invasive species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;“It’s bewildering, and I’m scared to death that it’s actually death by a thousand cuts,” Wagner said. “One of the scariest parts about it is that we don’t have an obvious smoking gun here.” A particular danger to these arthropods, in his view, was not temperature but droughts and lack of rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Lister pointed out that, since 1969, pesticide use has fallen more than 80 percent in Puerto Rico. He does not know what else could be to blame. The study authors used a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610918.2015.1122048?journalCode=lssp20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analytic method&lt;/a&gt;, invented by a professor of economics at Fordham University, to assess the role of heat. “It allows you to place a likelihood on variable X causing variable Y,” Lister said. “So we did that and then five out of our six populations we got the strongest possible support for heat causing those decreases in abundance of frogs and insects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;The authors sorted out the effects of weather like hurricanes and still saw a consistent trend, Schowalter said, which makes a convincing case for climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;“If anything, I think their results and caveats are understated. The gravity of their findings and ramifications for other animals, especially vertebrates, is hyperalarming,” Wagner said. But he is not convinced that climate change is the global driver of insect loss. “The decline of insects in northern Europe precedes that of climate change there,” he said. “Likewise, in New England, some tangible declines began in the 1950s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;No matter the cause, all of the scientists agreed that more people should pay attention to the bugpocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;“It’s a very scary thing,” Merrill said, that comes on the heels of a “gloomy, gloomy” U.N. report that estimated the world has little more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/?utm_term=.2bc091839d2c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a decade left&lt;/a&gt; to wrangle climate change under control. But “we can all step up,” he said, by using more fuel-efficient cars and turning off unused electronics. The Portland, Ore.-based Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental group that promotes insect conservation, recommends planting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://xerces.org/pollinator-conservation/gardens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; with native plants that flower throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;“Unfortunately, we have deaf ears in Washington,” Schowalter said. But those ears will listen at some point, he said, because our food supply will be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/science/decline-of-species-that-pollinate-poses-a-threat-to-global-food-supply-report-warns.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thirty-five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the world’s plant crops require pollination by bees, wasps and other animals. And arthropods are more than just pollinators. They’re the planet’s wee custodians, toiling away in unnoticed or avoided corners. They chew up rotting wood and eat carrion. “And none of us want to have more carcasses around,” Schowalter said. Wild insects provide $57 billion worth of six-legged labor in the United States each year, according to a 2006 estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;The loss of insects and arthropods could further rend the rain forest’s food web, Lister warned, causing plant species to go extinct without pollinators. “If the tropical forests go it will be yet another catastrophic failure of the whole Earth system,” he said, “that will feed back on human beings in an almost unimaginable way.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Exercise Might “Clean” the Alzheimer&amp;#039;s Brain</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-exercise-might-clean-the-alzheimers-brain1/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-exercise-might-clean-the-alzheimers-brain1/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alz.co.uk/research/WorldAlzheimerReport2015.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 million individuals worldwide&lt;/a&gt; ailing from Alzheimer’s disease, the announcements by pharmaceutical giants earlier this year that they will end research on therapeutics were devastating. The news is even more devastating considering projections that 100 million more people will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease across the globe by 2050, all potentially without a medical means to better their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, though, the pursuit of a therapeutic has been given a lifeline. &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6406/eaan8821&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; shows that physical exercise can “clean up” the hostile environments in the brains of Alzheimer’s mice, allowing new nerve cells in the hippocampus, the brain structure involved in memory and learning, to enable cognitive improvements, such as learning and memory. These findings imply that pharmacological agents that enrich the hippocampal environment to boost cell growth and survival might be effective to recuperate brain health and function in human Alzheimer’s disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-pathol-020712-163927&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain of an individual with Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is a harsh place filled with buildups of harmful nerve cell junk—amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles—and dramatic loss of nerve cells and connections that occur with severe cognitive decline, such as memory loss. Targeting and disrupting this harmful junk, specifically amyloid plaques, to restore brain function has been the basis of many failed clinical trials. This futility has led to a re-evaluation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.111&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the amyloid hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;—the central dogma for Alzheimer’s disease pathology based on the toxic accumulation of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there have been traces of evidence for &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad091531&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exercise playing a preventative role in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but exactly how this occurs and how to take advantage of it therapeutically has remained elusive. Exercise has been shown to create biochemical changes that fertilize the brain’s environment to mend nerve cell health. Additionally, exercise induces restorative changes relevant to Alzheimer’s disease pathology with improved nerve cell growth and connectivity in the hippocampus, a process called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0399_266&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adult hippocampal neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;. For these reasons, the authors Choi et al. explored whether exercise-induced effects and hippocampal nerve cell growth could be utilized for therapeutic purposes in Alzheimer’s disease to restore brain function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that exercised animals from a mouse model of Alzheimer’s had greatly enhanced memory compared to sedentary ones due to improved adult hippocampal neurogenesis and a rise in amounts of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4746328/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific molecule that promotes brain cell growth called BDNF&lt;/a&gt;.  Importantly, they could recover brain function, specifically memory, in mice with Alzheimer’s disease but without exercise by increasing hippocampal cell growth and BDNF levels using a combination of genetic—injecting a virus—and pharmacological means. On the other hand, blocking hippocampal neurogenesis early in Alzheimer’s worsened nerve cell health later in stages, leading to degeneration of the hippocampus and, subsequently, memory function. This provides preclinical proof of concept that a combination of drugs that increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF levels could be disease-modifying or prevent Alzheimer’s disease altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this work, things don’t look promising for the amyloid hypothesis—that Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the deposition of amyloid plaques. In this study, it was shown that eliminating amyloid plaques were not to necessary to ameliorate memory defects, which is consistent with evidence that plaques can also be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737680/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brains of healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. On the contrary, we may be looking at a new and improved fundamental theory for Alzheimer’s disease based on promoting a healthier brain environment and adult hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this inspiring news should be taken with an important caution—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4070393/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mouse models of Alzheimer’s are notorious for failing to translate into humans&lt;/a&gt; such that treatments that have worked to remedy mice have failed for humans. Besides, even if these findings translate into humans, it may apply to a fraction of Alzheimer’s individuals with relevant genetic components to the mouse model utilized. Future studies will need to replicate these results in mouse models emulating the range of known Alzheimer’s disease genetic milieus and, more importantly, prove its medical relevance to human disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before translating these findings into human patients, there remains significant research to establish that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(08)00838-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867408008386%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medication or drug could mimic the effects of exercise—exercise mimetics—&lt;/a&gt;by “cleaning up” the brain with BDNF and stimulating neurogenesis to combat Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, the method for administering BDNF to animals in the lab—by direct injection into the brain—is not ideal for use in people, and a hippocampal neurogenesis stimulating compound remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future attempts to generate pharmacological means to imitate and heighten the benefits of exercise—exercise mimetics—to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis in addition to BDNF may someday provide an effective means of improving cognition in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, increasing neurogenesis in the earliest stages of the disease may protect against neuronal cell death later in the disease, providing a potentially powerful disease-modifying treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Ex-Google engineer describing the company&amp;#039;s role in China censorship</title>
<link>https://threader.app/thread/1051725524064591872</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://threader.app/thread/1051725524064591872</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;thread-head&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;pic-user d-inline&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@real_vijay&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;post-img-user&quot; class=&quot;users-thread&quot; src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/929948905818570752/GI708xLD.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot; id=&quot;thread-post-start&quot;&gt;1/ Google is working on a new search engine code-named &quot;Dragonfly&quot; that will aid China's effort to censor information from its citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Google engineer I wanted to share some information on what it's like to be inside Google as these decisions are made &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;2/ I previously shared that in 2006 I was an engineer who worked on Google News and was asked to write code to censor new results in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've found some emails from 2006 that shed more light on the censorship requirements of the Chinese state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;3/ The emails I'm presenting came from a mailing list at Google where employees discussed topics on politics and economics. I have formatted the emails for readability and redacted the names of my colleagues, with whom I was debating. The topic was the 2008 Olympics in China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;4/ The striking fact that I had forgotten about until I rediscovered these emails was that China required Google to censor information both broadly (entire news sections were to be censored) and extremely expeditiously (Google needed to comply with requests within 15 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;5/ It is very likely that the same censorship requirements will apply to the Dragonfly project that Google is currently working on and perhaps the requirements have become even more stringent given Google's new willingness to comply with the Chinese state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;6/ The other thing I find disturbing, after all these years, is the willingness of my former colleagues to not only comply with the censorship but their enthusiasm in rationalizing it. It is not a coincidence that the rationale they give was the same one management had given them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;7/ As Blaise Pascal trenchantly observed in Pensées, *power creates opinion*. This is just as true within corporations as it is for national politics. There are benefits to toeing the line, plus obvious disadvantages to dissenting (e.g., risk of being fired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;8/ My colleagues, although they may have been well intentioned, were just regurgitating the reasons Google's management had given for its first foray into China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real problem, then as now, is that management seems to have no moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;9/ For many people there is little difference between what is legal and what is moral. This mindset is especially dangerous when it is held by people in power, such as Google's executives. The mindset is: if it's a legal requirement to censor, then we should do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;10/ The desire to comply becomes even more urgent for executives of large profit-seeking corporations because it gives them access to massive and lucrative markets. Without a strong moral compass, the temptation is far too strong for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;11/ As I previously tweeted, Sergey Brin is a notable exception to this temptation, and he is reported to be the reason that Google left China in 2010:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;12/ Unfortunately, Brin's influence in Google's decision making seems to have waned and the new management seems not only willing to be complicit in censorship, but to lie about what it's doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;thread-part&quot;&gt;13/ I encourage employees of Google who have been asked to work on censored products to stand up against these requests, as I did in 2006, and make it known that Google's willingness to censor is immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/real_vijay&quot;&gt;Vijay Boyapati&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____&lt;br/&gt;Tip: mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/threader_app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@threader_app&lt;/a&gt; on a Twitter thread with the keyword “compile” to get a link to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy Threader? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hi%20%40jack%2C%20I%20read%20Twitter%20threads%20on%20%40threader_app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tell @jack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;download-url&quot;&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threader/id1317519091?mt=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Threader&lt;/a&gt; on iOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository was created with the intention of helping developers master their concepts in JavaScript. It is not a requirement, but a guide for future studies. It is based on an article written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stephenthecurt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephen Curtis&lt;/a&gt; and you can read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stephenthecurt/33-fundamentals-every-javascript-developer-should-know-13dd720a90d1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>How Lisp Became God&amp;#039;s Own Programming Language</title>
<link>https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When programmers discuss the relative merits of different programming languages, they often talk about them in prosaic terms as if they were so many tools in a tool belt—one might be more appropriate for systems programming, another might be more appropriate for gluing together other programs to accomplish some ad hoc task. This is as it should be. Languages have different strengths and claiming that a language is better than other languages without reference to a specific use case only invites an unproductive and vitriolic debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one language that seems to inspire a peculiar universal reverence: Lisp. Keyboard crusaders that would otherwise pounce on anyone daring to suggest that some language is better than any other will concede that Lisp is on another level. Lisp transcends the utilitarian criteria used to judge other languages, because the median programmer has never used Lisp to build anything practical and probably never will, yet the reverence for Lisp runs so deep that Lisp is often ascribed mystical properties. Everyone’s favorite webcomic, &lt;em&gt;xkcd&lt;/em&gt;, has depicted Lisp this way at least twice: In &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/224/&quot;&gt;one comic&lt;/a&gt;, a character reaches some sort of Lisp enlightenment, which appears to allow him to comprehend the fundamental structure of the universe. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/297/&quot;&gt;another comic&lt;/a&gt;, a robed, senescent programmer hands a stack of parentheses to his padawan, saying that the parentheses are “elegant weapons for a more civilized age,” suggesting that Lisp has all the occult power of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great example is Bob Kanefsky’s parody of a song called “God Lives on Terra.” His parody, written in the mid-1990s and called “Eternal Flame”, describes how God must have created the world using Lisp. The following is an excerpt, but the full set of lyrics can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.en.html&quot;&gt;GNU Humor Collection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For God wrote in Lisp code&lt;br/&gt;When he filled the leaves with green.&lt;br/&gt;The fractal flowers and recursive roots:&lt;br/&gt;The most lovely hack I’ve seen.&lt;br/&gt;And when I ponder snowflakes,&lt;br/&gt;never finding two the same,&lt;br/&gt;I know God likes a language&lt;br/&gt;with its own four-letter name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only speak for myself, I suppose, but I think this “Lisp Is Arcane Magic” cultural meme is the most bizarre and fascinating thing ever. Lisp was concocted in the ivory tower as a tool for artificial intelligence research, so it was always going to be unfamiliar and maybe even a bit mysterious to the programming laity. But programmers now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/5c14o6/xkcd_lisp/d9szjnc/&quot;&gt;urge each other to “try Lisp before you die”&lt;/a&gt; as if it were some kind of mind-expanding psychedelic. They do this even though Lisp is now the second-oldest programming language in widespread use, younger only than Fortran, and even then by just one year.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; Imagine if your job were to promote some new programming language on behalf of the organization or team that created it. Wouldn’t it be great if you could convince everyone that your new language had divine powers? But how would you even do that? How does a programming language come to be known as a font of hidden knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Lisp get to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/images/byte_lisp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Byte Magazine Cover, August, 1979.&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover of Byte Magazine, August, 1979.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-a-the-axiomatic-language&quot;&gt;Theory A: The Axiomatic Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John McCarthy, Lisp’s creator, did not originally intend for Lisp to be an elegant distillation of the principles of computation. But, after one or two fortunate insights and a series of refinements, that’s what Lisp became. Paul Graham—we will talk about him some more later—has written that, with Lisp, McCarthy “did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt; People might see a deeper meaning in Lisp because McCarthy built Lisp out of parts so fundamental that it is hard to say whether he invented it or discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy began thinking about creating a language during the 1956 Darthmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. The Summer Research Project was in effect an ongoing, multi-week academic conference, the very first in the field of artificial intelligence. McCarthy, then an assistant professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth, had actually coined the term “artificial intelligence” when he proposed the event.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt; About ten or so people attended the conference for its entire duration.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt; Among them were Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, two researchers affiliated with the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon that had just designed a language called IPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell and Simon had been trying to build a system capable of generating proofs in propositional calculus. They realized that it would be hard to do this while working at the level of the computer’s native instruction set, so they decided to create a language—or, as they called it, a “pseudo-code”—that would help them more naturally express the workings of their “Logic Theory Machine.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt; Their language, called IPL for “Information Processing Language”, was more of a high-level assembly dialect then a programming language in the sense we mean today. Newell and Simon, perhaps referring to Fortran, noted that other “pseudo-codes” then in development were “preoccupied” with representing equations in standard mathematical notation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt; Their language focused instead on representing sentences in propositional calculus as lists of symbolic expressions. Programs in IPL would basically leverage a series of assembly-language macros to manipulate and evaluate expressions within one or more of these lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy thought that having algebraic expressions in a language, Fortran-style, would be useful. So he didn’t like IPL very much.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;/&gt; But he thought that symbolic lists were a good way to model problems in artificial intelligence, particularly problems involving deduction. This was the germ of McCarthy’s desire to create an algebraic list processing language, a language that would resemble Fortran but also be able to process symbolic lists like IPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Lisp today does not resemble Fortran. Over the next few years, McCarthy’s ideas about what an ideal list processing language should look like evolved. His ideas began to change in 1957, when he started writing routines for a chess-playing program in Fortran. The prolonged exposure to Fortran convinced McCarthy that there were several infelicities in its design, chief among them the awkward &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;/&gt; McCarthy invented an alternative, the “true” conditional expression, which returns sub-expression A if the supplied test succeeds and sub-expression B if the supplied test fails and which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; only evaluates the sub-expression that actually gets returned. During the summer of 1958, when McCarthy worked to design a program that could perform differentiation, he realized that his “true” conditional expression made writing recursive functions easier and more natural.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;/&gt; The differentiation problem also prompted McCarthy to devise the &lt;em&gt;maplist&lt;/em&gt; function, which takes another function as an argument and applies it to all the elements in a list.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;/&gt; This was useful for differentiating sums of arbitrarily many terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these things could be expressed in Fortran, so, in the fall of 1958, McCarthy set some students to work implementing Lisp. Since McCarthy was now an assistant professor at MIT, these were all MIT students. As McCarthy and his students translated his ideas into running code, they made changes that further simplified the language. The biggest change involved Lisp’s syntax. McCarthy had originally intended for the language to include something called “M-expressions,” which would be a layer of syntactic sugar that made Lisp’s syntax resemble Fortran’s. Though M-expressions could be translated to S-expressions—the basic lists enclosed by parentheses that Lisp is known for— S-expressions were really a low-level representation meant for the machine. The only problem was that McCarthy had been denoting M-expressions using square brackets, and the IBM 026 keypunch that McCarthy’s team used at MIT did not have any square bracket keys on its keyboard.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;/&gt; So the Lisp team stuck with S-expressions, using them to represent not just lists of data but function applications too. McCarthy and his students also made a few other simplifications, including a switch to prefix notation and a memory model change that meant the language only had one real type.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1960, McCarthy published his famous paper on Lisp called “Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine.” By that time, the language had been pared down to such a degree that McCarthy realized he had the makings of “an elegant mathematical system” and not just another programming language.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;/&gt; He later wrote that the many simplifications that had been made to Lisp turned it “into a way of describing computable functions much neater than the Turing machines or the general recursive definitions used in recursive function theory.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;/&gt; In his paper, he therefore presented Lisp both as a working programming language and as a formalism for studying the behavior of recursive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy explained Lisp to his readers by building it up out of only a very small collection of rules. Paul Graham later retraced McCarthy’s steps, using more readable language, in his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/jmc.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Roots of Lisp”&lt;/a&gt;. Graham is able to explain Lisp using only seven primitive operators, two different notations for functions, and a half-dozen higher-level functions defined in terms of the primitive operators. That Lisp can be specified by such a small sequence of basic rules no doubt contributes to its mystique. Graham has called McCarthy’s paper an attempt to “axiomatize computation.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;/&gt; I think that is a great way to think about Lisp’s appeal. Whereas other languages have clearly artificial constructs denoted by reserved words like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public static void&lt;/code&gt;, Lisp’s design almost seems entailed by the very logic of computing. This quality and Lisp’s original connection to a field as esoteric as “recursive function theory” should make it no surprise that Lisp has so much prestige today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-b-machine-of-the-future&quot;&gt;Theory B: Machine of the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades after its creation, Lisp had become, according to the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacker’s Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the “mother tongue” of artificial intelligence research. Early on, Lisp spread quickly, probably because its regular syntax made implementing it on new machines relatively straightforward. Later, researchers would keep using it because of how well it handled symbolic expressions, important in an era when so much of artificial intelligence was symbolic. Lisp was used in seminal artificial intelligence projects like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/shrdlu/&quot;&gt;SHRDLU natural language program&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma&quot;&gt;Macsyma algebra system&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2&quot;&gt;ACL2 logic system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mid-1970s, though, artificial intelligence researchers were running out of computer power. The PDP-10, in particular—everyone’s favorite machine for artificial intelligence work—had an 18-bit address space that increasingly was insufficient for Lisp AI programs.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;/&gt; Many AI programs were also supposed to be interactive, and making a demanding interactive program perform well on a time-sharing system was challenging. The solution, originally proposed by Peter Deutsch at MIT, was to engineer a computer specifically designed to run Lisp programs. These Lisp machines, as I described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/30/chaosnet.html&quot;&gt;my last post on Chaosnet&lt;/a&gt;, would give each user a dedicated processor optimized for Lisp. They would also eventually come with development environments written entirely in Lisp for hardcore Lisp programmers. Lisp machines, devised in an awkward moment at the tail of the minicomputer era but before the full flowering of the microcomputer revolution, were high-performance personal computers for the programming elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it seemed as if Lisp machines would be the wave of the future. Several companies sprang into existence and raced to commercialize the technology. The most successful of these companies was called Symbolics, founded by veterans of the MIT AI Lab. Throughout the 1980s, Symbolics produced a line of computers known as the 3600 series, which were popular in the AI field and in industries requiring high-powered computing. The 3600 series computers featured large screens, bit-mapped graphics, a mouse interface, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gV5obrYaogU?t=201&quot;&gt;powerful graphics and animation software&lt;/a&gt;. These were impressive machines that enabled impressive programs. For example, Bob Culley, who worked in robotics research and contacted me via Twitter, was able to implement and visualize a path-finding algorithm on a Symbolics 3650 in 1985. He explained to me that bit-mapped graphics and object-oriented programming (available on Lisp machines via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavors_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;the Flavors extension&lt;/a&gt;) were very new in the 1980s. Symbolics was the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/images/symbolics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bob Culley's path-finding program.&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bob Culley’s path-finding program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Symbolics machines were outrageously expensive. The Symbolics 3600 cost $110,000 in 1983.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16:1&quot;/&gt; So most people could only marvel at the power of Lisp machines and the wizardry of their Lisp-writing operators from afar. But marvel they did. &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; featured Lisp and Lisp machines several times from 1979 through to the end of the 1980s. In the August, 1979 issue, a special on Lisp, the magazine’s editor raved about the new machines being developed at MIT with “gobs of memory” and “an advanced operating system.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;/&gt; He thought they sounded so promising that they would make the two prior years—which saw the launch of the Apple II, the Commodore PET, and the TRS-80—look boring by comparison. A half decade later, in 1985, a &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; contributor described writing Lisp programs for the “sophisticated, superpowerful Symbolics 3670” and urged his audience to learn Lisp, claiming it was both “the language of choice for most people working in AI” and soon to be a general-purpose programming language as well.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Paul McJones, who has done lots of Lisp &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/&quot;&gt;preservation work&lt;/a&gt; for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, about when people first began talking about Lisp as if it were a gift from higher-dimensional beings. He said that the inherent properties of the language no doubt had a lot to do with it, but he also said that the close association between Lisp and the powerful artificial intelligence applications of the 1960s and 1970s probably contributed too. When Lisp machines became available for purchase in the 1980s, a few more people outside of places like MIT and Stanford were exposed to Lisp’s power and the legend grew. Today, Lisp machines and Symbolics are little remembered, but they helped keep the mystique of Lisp alive through to the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-c-learn-to-program&quot;&gt;Theory C: Learn to Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, MIT professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman, along with Sussman’s wife, Julie Sussman, published a textbook called &lt;em&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/em&gt;. The textbook introduced readers to programming using the language Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. It was used to teach MIT’s introductory programming class for two decades. My hunch is that SICP (as the title is commonly abbreviated) about doubled Lisp’s “mystique factor.” SICP took Lisp and showed how it could be used to illustrate deep, almost philosophical concepts in the art of computer programming. Those concepts were general enough that any language could have been used, but SICP’s authors chose Lisp. As a result, Lisp’s reputation was augmented by the notoriety of this bizarre and brilliant book, which has intrigued generations of programmers (and also become &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/47038-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-hugeass-image-dump-for-evidence&quot;&gt;a very strange meme&lt;/a&gt;). Lisp had always been “McCarthy’s elegant formalism”; now it was also “that language that teaches you the hidden secrets of programming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth dwelling for a while on how weird SICP really is, because I think the book’s weirdness and Lisp’s weirdness get conflated today. The weirdness starts with the book’s cover. It depicts a wizard or alchemist approaching a table, prepared to perform some sort of sorcery. In one hand he holds a set of calipers or a compass, in the other he holds a globe inscribed with the words “eval” and “apply.” A woman opposite him gestures at the table; in the background, the Greek letter lambda floats in mid-air, radiating light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/images/sicp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cover art for SICP.&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover art for SICP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what is going on here? Why does the table have animal feet? Why is the woman gesturing at the table? What is the significance of the inkwell? Are we supposed to conclude that the wizard has unlocked the hidden mysteries of the universe, and that those mysterious consist of the “eval/apply” loop and the Lambda Calculus? It would seem so. This image alone must have done an enormous amount to shape how people talk about Lisp today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the text of the book itself is often just as weird. SICP is unlike most other computer science textbooks that you have ever read. Its authors explain in the foreword to the book that the book is not merely about how to program in Lisp—it is instead about “three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of computer programs, and the computer.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;/&gt; Later, they elaborate, describing their conviction that programming shouldn’t be considered a discipline of computer science but instead should be considered a new notation for “procedural epistemology.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;/&gt; Programs are a new way of structuring thought that only incidentally get fed into computers. The first chapter of the book gives a brief tour of Lisp, but most of the book after that point is about much more abstract concepts. There is a discussion of different programming paradigms, a discussion of the nature of “time” and “identity” in object-oriented systems, and at one point a discussion of how synchronization problems may arise because of fundamental constraints on communication that play a role akin to the fixed speed of light in the theory of relativity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;/&gt; It’s heady stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this isn’t to say that the book is bad. It’s a wonderful book. It discusses important programming concepts at a higher level than anything else I have read, concepts that I had long wondered about but didn’t quite have the language to describe. It’s impressive that an introductory programming textbook can move so quickly to describing the fundamental shortfalls of object-oriented programming and the benefits of functional languages that minimize mutable state. It’s mind-blowing that this then turns into a discussion of how a stream paradigm, perhaps something like today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/&quot;&gt;RxJS&lt;/a&gt;, can give you the best of both worlds. SICP distills the essence of high-level program design in a way reminiscent of McCarthy’s original Lisp paper. The first thing you want to do after reading it is get your programmer friends to read it; if they look it up, see the cover, but then don’t read it, all they take away is that some mysterious, fundamental “eval/apply” thing gives magicians special powers over tables with animal feet. I would be deeply impressed in their shoes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe SICP’s most important contribution was to elevate Lisp from curious oddity to pedagogical must-have. Well before SICP, people told each other to learn Lisp as a way of getting better at programming. The 1979 Lisp issue of &lt;em&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/em&gt; is testament to that fact. The same editor that raved about MIT’s new Lisp machines also explained that the language was worth learning because it “represents a different point of view from which to analyze problems.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;/&gt; But SICP presented Lisp as more than just a foil for other languages; SICP used Lisp as an &lt;em&gt;introductory&lt;/em&gt; language, implicitly making the argument that Lisp is the best language in which to grasp the fundamentals of computer programming. When programmers today tell each other to try Lisp before they die, they arguably do so in large part because of SICP. After all, the language &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck&quot;&gt;Brainfuck&lt;/a&gt; presumably offers “a different point of view from which to analyze problems.” But people learn Lisp instead because they know that, for twenty years or so, the Lisp point of view was thought to be so useful that MIT taught Lisp to undergraduates before anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lisp-comes-back&quot;&gt;Lisp Comes Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year that SICP was released, Bjarne Stroustrup published the first edition of &lt;em&gt;The C++ Programming Language&lt;/em&gt;, which brought object-oriented programming to the masses. A few years later, the market for Lisp machines collapsed and the AI winter began. For the next decade and change, C++ and then Java would be the languages of the future and Lisp would be left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course impossible to pinpoint when people started getting excited about Lisp again. But that may have happened after Paul Graham, Y-Combinator co-founder and Hacker News creator, published a series of influential essays pushing Lisp as the best language for startups. In his essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;&gt;“Beating the Averages,”&lt;/a&gt; for example, Graham argued that Lisp macros simply made Lisp more powerful than other languages. He claimed that using Lisp at his own startup, Viaweb, helped him develop features faster than his competitors were able to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20061004035628/http://wiki.alu.org/Chris-Perkins&quot;&gt;Some programmers at least&lt;/a&gt; were persuaded. But the vast majority of programmers did not switch to Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened instead is that more and more Lisp-y features have been incorporated into everyone’s favorite programming languages. Python got list comprehensions. C# got Linq. Ruby got… well, Ruby &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/&quot;&gt;is a Lisp&lt;/a&gt;. As Graham noted even back in 2001, “the default language, embodied in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot;/&gt; Though other languages are gradually becoming like Lisp, Lisp itself somehow manages to retain its special reputation as that mysterious language that few people understand but everybody should learn. In 1980, on the occasion of Lisp’s 20th anniversary, McCarthy wrote that Lisp had survived as long as it had because it occupied “some kind of approximate local optimum in the space of programming languages.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:24&quot;/&gt; That understates Lisp’s real influence. Lisp hasn’t survived for over half a century because programmers have begrudgingly conceded that it is the best tool for the job decade after decade; in fact, it has survived even though most programmers do not use it at all. Thanks to its origins and use in artificial intelligence research and perhaps also the legacy of SICP, Lisp continues to fascinate people. Until we can imagine God creating the world with some newer language, Lisp isn’t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a web developer and learned on MBPs. The touchpad was the right size, the keys had the right amount of travel, the form factor and weight were perfect.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Right now I'm considering moving to developing on a Galaga Pro and using Windows/WSL. I've got most things setup on my desktop how I like using HyperTerm (I had too much trouble with Cmder), VS Code, and ZSH. I can't seem to figure out how to install PHP 7.2 correctly to work on Laravel, nor get my GPG and SSH keys for Github working.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The bright side is if I move to Windows I wouldn't have to give up very many programs, or they have some rough but useable equivalents (Spectacle, Sequel Pro, Gifox, Bear).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I was tempted to go with Elementary on the Razer Blade Stealth, but I still want 32gb of RAM, and Propellerheads Reason doesn't work on Linux.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1) MagSafe. I know they really want to go all in on USB-C, but the original MagSafe connector was awesome. Even the weaker 2.0 version was nice. There were two instances where that connector saved my laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2) The laser-drilled power indicator. That was so cool. It looked like the light magically appeared &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the aluminum. Now there's no indication whatsoever if your laptop is on or asleep or off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3) The 2007-2011 keyboards. The ones with the real travel. Even the 2012 version with slightly reduced travel was okay. But my 2007 MacBook had the best laptop keyboard I'd ever used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;4) HDMI and SD Card slot. These are the kinds of things that you happen to need when you least expect it. When you're least likely to have that dongle with you. They're also thin ports that will fit nicely without bulking up the chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;5) Of course, function keys and an ESC key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm going to keep my 2012 MBP going as long as I can. But when it dies or is no longer supported, I'm pretty sure ThinkPad is where I'm headed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;30.880493446415&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My current Macbook Pro is probably the first bit of Apple hardware in two decades that's made me actively consider alternatives. It's been the one laptop - premium at that - from Apple which I've had continual frustrations with compared to its predecessor, for all the reasons listed above.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I love USB-C, but not for power. Already, two of my ports are loose. I've never had that on any previous Apple power connector. MagSafe was a brilliant solution to real problems, and just dropping it without a superior alternative is not at all what I expect from Apple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I also like the universality of USB-C, but it's not like Apple didn't opt to keep one legacy port for usability reasons - that little headphone port. SD and HDMI would have been enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And yes, the keyboard is terrible. For a machine I spend all day on, designed for pros, its a disappointment. Like most people here, it always takes me a little time to adapt to a new keyboard; unlike in the past, after more than a year I still loathe this one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Perhaps the only thing that doesn't bring out my inner rage is the Touchbar. I'm largely ambivalent about it - the lack of esc/f-keys was annoying for a few days but I adapted. Obviously, others disagree, but on this list its the one choice I could have found a way to rationalize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They keyboard keys feel unpleasant, and now my H key has become unreliable (about 50% of the time it works, about 25% of the time it fails to register, and 25% of the time it types 2 characters). Dealing with dongles is not worth the headache. The touchbar is a step back in UI. The new trackpad is so large I bump it all the time. MagSafe was beloved for a reason.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yesterday the last straw landed and I started setting up my 2012 MacBook again, at least for my writing, where I need a reliable built-in keyboard. I know Apple has a repair program for the 2017 MacBook keyboard[1], but it's my work machine, it's really hard to part with it for 1-3 days of repairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;ThinkPads have garbage quality control. My last three: two T450s that had bad backlight bleed. Then a X1 Carbon 6th Gen that doesn't have backlight bleed, but LTE that just stops working randomly. (At least once a day, usually when waking up from sleep--so bad I've just disabled it.) Also, the X1C6 has the best trackpad on the ThinkPad line, or so I'm told, but it still sucks compared to a MacBook Pro. My next machine is going to be a Surface Laptop, I think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;iPhones are constantly bashed by a group of users because of not having USB-C connectors. Having four USB-C ports with identical capabilities on a MacBook pro is a more pragmatic and flexible solution to have, when compared to MagSafe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;On the power level and power button issue, Apple changes its features to shape customer behavior and expectation from its devices. Apple removed battery meter from Macs since it's standby is too long (30 days) and robust (auto-hibernation), so you're unlikely to run out of juice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They also believe in the stability of MacOS such that it's not important whether the machine is off or in standby. Because it boots in ~10 seconds and wakes up in ~2. They want to remove these distinctions from their computers and try to lower your cognitive load. Actually this is one of the finest features of the Macs IMHO. They don't make you think to use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Open the lid, and if the screen doesn't come on, press the power button, done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I found that most (if not all) people who rave about a USB-C-only future do not actually use more than 1 or 2 peripherals. Or they want it for power connection only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Anybody who a) has a significant number of USB-A peripherals (in my case, I'd say the number is above 30 distinct devices), b) understands that the USB-C label doesn't mean that it will work when you plug it in, has a more sensible approach: USB-C is fine, but don't remove our USB-A (or lightning) ports just yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't understand why it can't have both. Have a magsafe port, ship with a magsafe charger. But if you happen to connect a USB-C charger to one of the USB-C ports, charge through that too. No issue. Playstation portable was like this - you could charge it through proprietary playstation charger, or if you connected a mini-usb cable it would charge through it. No issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The first problem appeared some time after I got the adapter, but at some point I just stopped using it, because the magnet are too weak, and because it have to be oriented a certain way. A few weeks ago I used it again, forget the laptop in the charger overnight, and it was dead the next morning.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.894894894895&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;IMHO, Macs are much more functional than they look, but they need a different way of thinking and some adjustment. Apple likes to move in front of the curve in terms of connectivity and its utilization. It's their way of design, and they like to show it as a part of the brand.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;However, I'm not implying that everyone should be comfortable with the operation principles of new MacBooks or their devices in general. I love the challenge and the different perspectives they bring, but it's sometimes limiting and slowing down until finding the best way to utilize them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is why we have different brands and designs, because one design indeed doesn't fit all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If having to find out how to best use your tool is a challenge (especially when the new iteration seems to be such an apparent step backwards compared to the old), maybe it simply isn't good design.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I also like Rams and aware some of his work. Also I see traces of his work through Mac/iOS calculators (which nods to Braun's ones), and apple's software (low level) design philosophy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That adjustment, at least in my case, doesn't come from the tool itself. I'm also a heavy Linux desktop user, so making two systems work nice (for my standards) took some time when I introduced Macs into my workflow ~10 years ago. Currently I have no friction. I think if I was solely a Mac user, that initial friction should be non-existent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;OTOH, the newest Mac I have is a Mid-2014 MBP. I don't know how the new ones compare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Honestly, I'm way too flexible and adaptable when it comes to new designs and paradigms. I think I don't have the complaint circuitry in my brain. I like to just accept and adapt. I see it as a way to counteract the tendency of being fixed on things I like, but are outdated. I also love to bring good ideas and features from new things to the old, to refine my old habits and increase productivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But, as I always say, that's just me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Cough, cough......USB-C.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c5a&quot;&gt;Well, this is where Apple gets it right - every USB-C socket supports everything. (Ok, mostly. Looking at you, MacBook 12!)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Socket - yes. But you can walk into an official Apple store, buy a brand new MacBook Pro + an &quot;apple approved&quot; LG USB-C display, and guess what - the USB-C cable that is bundled with your MacBook Pro cannot be used with the display that you just bought. What's worse, MacOS won't tell you why it doesn't work - it just won't. It's the worst and most user-hostile design in computers I have seen in years.&lt;/span&gt;

Previously I’d just wait for the light to start “breathing” and I know it’s sleeping.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I’ve been caught out several times now on the new units where I closed the lid and came back hours later only to find the laptop still on and very warm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Mostly seems down to VMs or backups running that don’t seem to want to suspend. So now I always suspend my VMs and stop backups. Which slows down my workflow greatly since it takes a minute each to suspend and resume the VM itself. I also find myself holding the laptop undercarriage right up against my ear listening for the whirring of the fans and if they stop. I look like a right idiot doing it, but there’s no other way to tell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I used to develop on a 2015 Macbook Pro, which was a fantastic computer, but I don't like the new ones as much. I've also used a 2017 Dell XPS 13 and it was good, but the Lenovo feels better to me.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Things that make it great:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1) Slightly larger screen at 14&quot; is very nice, but the overall computer is still lighter than a MBP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2) Keyboard is fantastic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3) Build quality feels like it can hold up to more abuse than MBP or Dell XPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;4) Has USB-C ports, but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; has old USB-A style ports, so no need for adapters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I dual boot with Windows and Linux. For better or worse, I still need to use Excel sometimes and LibreOffice's version doesn't cut it. The only thing I miss about macOS over Ubuntu is the ability to install Microsoft Office (without using Wine).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;[1] plug for Costco who sells a nicely loaded (i7 processor, 16gb RAM, 512GB hard drive) version for $1500, or $1400 on sale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I never use the touchpad for anything regular keys wouldn't do better. The keyboard on my 2017 MBP13 failed three times in the year I've owned it. The first time, the Apple Store person &quot;cleaned&quot; the keyboard, fixed things for a while. A couple of weeks later, the problem came back. I insisted on a better solution, and they replaced the keyboard.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Five months later, a different key failed, and the Apple Store people sent it to Memphis. This time, it came back with one of the &quot;new and improved&quot; keyboards. They also replaced the screen because of 'delamination' which I hadn't noticed. The total amount they spent to repair this computer is approaching the cost of the machine at this point! So far, the new keyboard hasn't failed yet but I'm not holding my breath…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;39.862637362637&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I had a similar experience with a top spec late 2016 MBP, which I switched to from a PC for web development. It was my first and last Apple product.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;After opening the lid one day there was a loud crackling noise and the speakers were both blown. To repair it, the Apple store had to replace the entire top case (top half of the chassis including keyboard, trackpad, speakers) and also replaced the battery, which would have cost ~£500.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I got it back two weeks later after dealing with a smug 'Genius' who treated me like an idiot. He also claimed that the software diagnostics were clean, so there was nothing wrong with the laptop. I had to drive 1 1/2 hours each way to the store for a second time during business hours just to argue in person with them, because the speakers were clearly broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The exact same problem happened twice more over the next year, taking two weeks to fix each time. The final time was outside of the 1yr AppleCare warranty, and they wanted to replace the top case, battery and logic board for ~£800.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Coupled with the useless touch bar, 16GM RAM cap, awful display scaling issues/confusion when external monitors were attached, sluggish performance for video editing and OS updates that broke the machine, it convinced me to avoid Apple products completely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Looking into how Docker works properly takes some time, so there is some overhead with that, but being able to switch environments between projects, test upgrading libs etc and instantly being able to switch back has been a game changer for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.860383944154&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;WSL is terrible. It's basically a tech demo (look up what happens if you `cp` a file from `C:\...` to `/home/user` versus `copy` or going the other direction.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's alright to boot up a linux &quot;VM&quot; using docker, but then you have to pay extra for windows pro or whatever so you can unlock hypervisor privileges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I recently bought an extra SSD to put into the windows desktop I bought and am happily running linux, don't miss windows since I put it on there (even some steam games are quite nice and convenient).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Anyway, just look into WSL before you bet the farm on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;12.921402660218&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is not accurate. I used WSL professionally for 2 years until recently switching back to Linux for unrelated reasons¹. The only issue I have had with WSL is filesystem performance. However, that is largely a result of the real-time virus protection in Windows Defender. Real-time protection is practically useless and slows down the rest of your computer as well, so disabling it is a pretty easy fix.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;WSL is actually a fantastic piece of software. I can't believe how easy it is to install literal Arch Linux onto my Windows machine. It's also fairly simple these days to integrate VS Code with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;¹ I've gradually lost enough vision in both eyes that I frequently lose track of the mouse cursor, so I switched to Linux for i3wm and better keyboard controls. Otherwise I would likely still be using Windows + WSL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Agreed, I think it's an amazing feature. Have been a full time linux user for 20 years, my new laptop is BIOS locked ( ugh ) so I _cant_ install linux ( didnt know that before buying it ) , but it's actually not an issue because of WSL, it's exactly what I always wanted in Windows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I mainly run lubuntu for my desktop needs and every now and then I think gentoo wouldn't do this to me gentoo might take 3 days for a upgrade to complete, but it wouldn't fail me like lubuntu is right now. Plus systemd makes me scream at night.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I've been thinking recently about a similar service that instead of trying to find content that it thinks you'd like and relates to your current interest, it would work the opposite, just for you to find new and interesting things that are outside your normal content-bubble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The photos app was amazing. Live tiles are amazing. The music player and it's live tile was amazing. The performance was the same whether on a low end budget phone or the top of the line model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So many good ui and ux decisions like the lack of hamburger menus and placement of all menu items along the bottom of the screen with the extra items being hidden away in a drop-down using ellipsis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The UI and UX were both extremely well thought out and worked smoother than any Android phone on equivalent specs. (apart from the confusing settings menus)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The lack of adoption from both devs and users killed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Both of these fall square on Microsoft. Developers didn't care for the platform in part because there weren't users, but also because every version had a completely different UI framework that wasn't compatible with older oses, but if you didn't use it, your app wouldn't fit well on the new oses (and occasionally never start up). Developers of Windows mobile 6 apps had no path to wp7, other than rewriting everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Users got a very weird upgrade story. Sometimes, upgrades were just not available, despite promises that they would be. Windows Mobile 10 was a mess, Edge is worse than mobile IE, but users don't have a choice to go back. Microsoft pushed back on a mobile Firefox in the app store early, and if they changed their mind it was too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Finally, Microsoft decided to retarget towards the high end with Windows Mobile 10 devices -- somehow they forgot that most of the devices they were selling were low end devices, where they could have a lot better responsiveness than a similar cost Android, because of platform differences (single app at a time is probably a big part, but maybe there's some other components).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Windows Mobile 10 also lost all the boxy UI which I loved :(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I must say, the first time in ages I used a modern windows phone was some Nokia in 2014ish, still running wp 8. I was really positively surprised how well designed it was. Pleasing to use, at least what I could judge from in a day of use. This whole tile bullshit from the desktop finally made sense and felt great. Also Scrolling felt smoother than on any Android device I ever held for some reason.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;9.9043977055449&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Imo, the hubs were really what made WP special and it would've been amazing with more third-party buy-in (which realistically was never going to happen). Going to a single centralized spot for social media or whatever else, instead of browsing through a dozen different apps, is such a great idea.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I was totally on board with WP but then Microsoft bungled the later WP updates (my phone wasn't supported, and it was one of the last ones with a physical keyboard) and third-parties never really supported the platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Blackberry 10 OS had the same thing -- a unified location (called the hub) where all of you communication would go. It was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, except that third-party apps rarely (and decreasingly) integrated with it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;With Android, Blackberry changed its strategy and now integrated all social notifications into the Hub. But it just opens the corresponding conversation in the social app, you can't respond directly from the Hub (which should be possible to implement now with Nougat-style answer to notifications)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The swiping keyboard had an accuracy unmatched by anything since, including the Lumia 950 I'm using to type this, which sucks (win 10 mobile rebuilt it for some stupid reason. It was perfect!)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I still think about going back to the 925. Battery life was great, camera was decent, and it was the perfect size for hand and pocket. Only the browser lets it down and that's mostly because modern js sites don't support ie mobile and a lot of stuff breaks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I had a series of them and was all-in on the new models announced via kickstarter, when they suddenly disappeared and were bought by Fitbit. All forthcoming products were killed off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They've been pretty reasonable with sunsetting the servers and helping the community move towards an open model, but it's only a matter of time before my Pebble Time Round bites the dust and I can't fix it (my partner's has already gone)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Pebble Time 2 was going to be the ultimate watch as far as I was concerned. Such a shame it never got made. I still love my old Pebble collection and wear them regularly.

It hits a sweet spot for me between being user configurable, having limited communications and display and y'know, being a actual wristwatch. It's not nearly as full featured as my Pebble, but it also has a multi-year battery life and long range subghz RF for notifications and whatnot.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Battery lasts a month, screen is not e-ink but it's always on (I believe LCD), watchfaces are customizable but there's not a lot of good ones since the resolution of the screen and the colors aren't great. Functionality is pretty limited, but good enough for time, gps and notifications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have one and I'm satisfied with it, and I'm looking forward to what they do with v2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;+1 for this. The Bip is great for the price (I paid £60). If the SW was a little better (e.g. music control, some better watchfaces) it would be perfect. Maybe being a tad smaller + a bit nicer looking as well. It's great as a notifier on your wrist that works well as a watch.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, the edge is slightly raised above the face on it, so while there are a couple of nicks on the bezel, there are no scratches on the glass. The sapphire glass may also be part of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This has become so frustrating as of late, especially when you search for something like &quot;c++ map&quot; and it decides to completely ignore the &quot;c++&quot; part of your search, leaving you with pages of actual maps.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think this is a function of trying to make searches more effective for unsophisticated users at the expense of users who know how to be more precise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Similar to Apple and GNOME, it ends up penalizing the expert users to cater to non-expert users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is why you need to have the regular interface for people who shouldn't be expected to be experts, but have a separate interface for people who know what they are doing, because supporting both types of users is often mutually exclusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The google behavior you describe got so annoying for me, along with the inability to copy the link in the results, I switched to DDG. It still provides results that don’t include one of my search terms all the time. It’s really annoying behavior.&lt;/span&gt;

As in, with Altavista you needed to rummage through the first couple pages (luckily back then you only had a couple pages' worth of results) to find what you were looking for.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Maybe what we miss is not exactly Altavista but a mid-2000s Google, also with the low occurrence of spam and sponsored content that we had back then. How about duckduckgo, does it fit the bill?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Similarly, rockbox was really great mp3 player firmware, when I used to use one of those. It had a funny feature I've never seen elsewhere: multi-lingual article-ignoring sort.

I use it almost every day. I remember the first time I tried Rockbox on it; when it didn't take 5 minutes to boot because it was scanning every file (like the stock firmware did), I loved it immediately. When 3.14 came out last year, I got excited when I discovered that I could play Opus files on it. (Before, it crashed hard every time I tried.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I got one for my dad last year, and was surprised that Sandisk discontinued the Rockbox compatible models, and used players were going for $~50, presumably because of their Rockbox compatibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rockbox had the best interface of any music player ever (along with WinAmp), and even though having all my music in the cloud is great, neither Amazon nor Google seem to have taken into account that you might actually have a large music collection when designing their Android players.

With a small group of five friends we set up a Friday DJ rotation where one person would queue songs all day and the others listen in. All the &quot;broadcasts&quot; got saved as playlists, which you could &quot;favourite&quot; from your own account and go back to whenever you wanted. People could make requests when they had a &quot;next track&quot; that would segue well with what you were already playing. It was really fun!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have never had a period of more high quality music discovery and I sorely miss those playlists, many of which featured obscure/rare/live tracks that simply aren't available in today's music services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;26.884120171674&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Mine was definitely one the 200 series SanDisks! I can't say for certain which device I used. I got the device from my roommate, who got it in a woot.com &quot;bag of crap&quot; that included a couple refurbed mp3 players.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I remember the default firmware being extremely slow to use. It spent cpu time it couldn't afford to render animations between &quot;apps&quot; that added nothing. I think it may have been extensor picky about which codecs it supported, though I wouldn't have had much that wasn't mp3s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I really loved rockbox. I liked how configurable it was, and how minimal it was. I'd previously used sdd based mp3 players. A dell dj (I was crushed when they canceled that line, and more so when the Seagate hard drive failed) and the first gen video ipod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Rockbox worked very well for music, which is all I used it for. I always used windows explorer to transfer files to /from, and that worked well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I found installing rockbox very easy. More so than installing ddwrt or homebrew on a wii. I don't think I ever updated rockbox. I probably used it for a year and a half, max.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A group of buzz makers tries to steal the glory from the real titans under disguise of so called disruption. All without delivering the real value, but with tons of religious preaching.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The computing industry probably reached the levels of Hollywood in 1930s where every Joe and Mary were going to make it. It clearly is a fad, but at the same time we have to face the fact that computing industry had become more mature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As a result, it started to absorb wider areas and masses of people. While the &quot;preaching fad&quot; will certainly fade away, we have to deal with increased technological segregation caused but the massive influx.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;...which I coincidentally listened to via Audible today. There’s a lot more to the story than, “...shut them down... for insufficient profits.” They wanted to branch out from the RTS genre, prototyped a bunch of different ideas, but didn’t really get far enough (or enough traction with MSFT, which wrote their checks) to ship them. Microsoft was wary of them launching new IP, so tasked them with making Halo Wars, which was an RTS for consoles. This was a drastically different undertaking than RTS-for-PCs due to controllers (instead of keyboards + mice), and they all got burned out working on it after many years. Microsoft shut them down after Halo Wars shipped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm sure there were many reasons it died, but my theory is that Google strategically wanted to kill it because the User was in control of the data-sources and the algorithm.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is what Facebook and Twitter did. Their feeds used to be a simple chrono sort of sources you determined, but then they slowly took control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was a great way to follow the Internet chronologically and could have been developed much further from that point of view.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Nowadays you are supposed follow the Internet randomly, based on whatever you happen to see in social media by chance or curated by algorithms. It’s not a good way to get a balanced view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It ticks me off to this day. I can’t imagine it being terribly difficult to maintain, particularly with Google’s limitless resources.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It would have been amazing if instead of having Google Plus be an entirely separate thing, they had added Google Plus's sharing and discussion features onto Google Reader and grown from that as a base. Something like that could very well still be a thriving product today.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm gonna say Reader was like a dysfunctional relationship for me, once they shut it down and I had to move on (currently using newsblur.com) I saw how good an actively devoped RSS app could be&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Honestly, ever since Reader was killed I have way more free time on my hands. Maybe it was my poor time management but it was a time hole for me, I'm actually glad that, at the time, nothing as good was around to make me stick on the endless RSS feeds I was subscribed.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have the opposite issue: I love newsblur so much, because I can fast forward through RSS feeds and read them quickly, which means I don't have to keep going to the sites.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c5a&quot;&gt;I used Feedly for a while, but I pretty much abandoned my RSS fix after the demise of Reader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I do miss it, and the idea that this was a popular way to consume news / content etc. However I can still use RSS on feedly, inoreader and a bunch of self-hosted alternatives. By moving away from Google I am also escaping their all-seeing eye, albeit to some minor extent. In the time since Google retired Reader I have begun to see them as a negative presence in the world. I have moved from Gmail and Google Calendar to Fastmail, self-host my contacts and will move on from Android as soon as Ubuntu Touch or another alternative become fully featured enough.&lt;/span&gt;

<title>Paul Allen has died</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;25619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;MSFT&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Co-Founder Paul Allen died from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen's Vulcan Inc. announced that he died in Seattle at 65 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VulcanInc/status/1051957360455892992&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@VulcanInc: It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of @PaulGAllen, our founder and noted technologist, philanthropist, community builder, conservationist, musician and supporter of the arts. All of us who worked with Paul feel an inexpressible loss today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen's sister, Jody, said he was &quot;a remarkable individual on every level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While most knew Paul Allen as a technologist and philanthropist, for us he was a much-loved brother and uncle, and an exceptional friend. Paul's family and friends were blessed to experience his wit, warmth, his generosity and deep concern,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;For all the demands on his schedule, there was always time for family and friends. At this time of loss and grief for us – and so many others – we are profoundly grateful for the care and concern he demonstrated every day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen ranked among the world's wealthiest individuals. As of Monday afternoon, he ranked 44th on &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#29058880251c&quot;&gt;Forbes' 2018 list of billionaires&lt;/a&gt; with an estimated net worth of more than $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Vulcan, Allen's network of philanthropic efforts and organizations, the Microsoft co-founder supported research in artificial intelligence and new frontier technologies. The group also invested in Seattle's cultural institutions and the revitalization of parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen owned two professional sports teams, the NFL Seattle Seahawks and NBA Portland Trailblazers. He was also an electric guitarist who occasionally jammed with celebrity musicians including Bono and Mick Jagger, and a huge music fan. He funded and designed the Experience Music Project in Seattle, devoted to the history of rock music and dedicated to his musical hero Jimi Hendrix. (It has since been re-christened the &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mopop.org/&quot;&gt;Museum of Pop Culture&lt;/a&gt;.) The building was designed by architect Frank Gehry to resemble a melted electric guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulcan CEO Bill Hilf said, &quot;All of us who had the honor of working with Paul feel inexpressible loss today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He possessed a remarkable intellect and a passion to solve some of the world's most difficult problems, with the conviction that creative thinking and new approaches could make profound and lasting impact,&quot; Hilf said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Allen revealed that he had started treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the same type of cancer he was treated for in 2009. In 1983, Allen left the company he founded with Bill Gates when he was first diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, which he defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft with Allen, said that &quot;personal computing would not have existed without him&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends, Paul Allen. From our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Paul wasn't content with starting one company. He channeled his intellect and compassion into a second act focused on improving people's lives and strengthening communities in Seattle and around the world. He was fond of saying, &quot;If it has the potential to do good, then we should do it.&quot; That's the kind of person he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul loved life and those around him, and we all cherished him in return. He deserved much more time, but his contributions to the world of technology and philanthropy will live on for generations to come. I will miss him tremendously.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Allen made &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6457724980540121088/&quot;&gt;&quot;indispensible&quot; contributions to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and the technology industry. Nadella also said he learned a lot from Allen and will continue to be inspired by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As co-founder of Microsoft, in his own quiet and persistent way, he created magical products, experiences and institutions, and in doing so, he changed the world,&quot; Nadella said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called Allen a &quot;truly wonderful, bright and inspiring person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steven_ballmer/status/1051962323227856897?s=12&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@steven_ballmer: Paul was a truly wonderful, bright and inspiring person—and a great friend. I will miss him&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, former president of Microsoft's Windows division, said Allen &quot;did so much to shape lives with computing and his later work in science, community, and research.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1051959374233489408&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@stevesi: Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen dies Paul was an original and a dear person who did so much to shape lives with computing and his later work in science, community, and research. I am so deeply saddened by his passing. He will be missed. RIP Paul.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll said he was deeply saddened by Allen's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petecarroll/status/1051965960830181376?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@PeteCarroll: Deeply saddened by the passing of @PaulGAllen. I'll miss him greatly. His gracious leadership and tremendous inspiration will never be forgotten. The world is a better place because of Paul's passion, commitment, and selflessness. His legacy will live on forever.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Allen was &quot;the driving force behind keeping the NFL in the Pacific Northwest.&quot; Goodell said he valued Allen's advice on a wide range of subjects and sent his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;His passion for the game, combined with his quiet determination, led to a model organization on and off the field. He worked tirelessly alongside our medical advisers to identify new ways to make the game safer and protect our players from unnecessary risk&quot; Goodell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trail Blazers tweeted, &quot;We miss you. We thank you. We love you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1051962568292458496&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@trailblazers: We miss you. We thank you. We love you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen's death was met with an outpouring of condolences from tech leaders. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said with Allen's death, the world has &quot;lost a great technology pioneer today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1051969167618801664?s=21&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@sundarpichai: We lost a great technology pioneer today - thank you Paul Allen for your immense contributions to the world through your work and your philanthropy. Thoughts are with his family and the entire Microsoft community.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook called him a &quot;pioneer&quot; and a &quot;force for good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1051976402126270464?s=12&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@timcook Our industry has lost a pioneer and our world has lost a force for good. We send our deepest condolences to Paul's friends, the Allen family and everyone at Microsoft.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he was saddened by Allen's passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1051971422296264704&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@Benioff: Saddened by the passing of Paul Allen a great leader in tech and a man of all seasons who fully enjoyed his life and wealth yet also gave back to the world at scale. I was especially impressed with how he took care of the Oceans. May the one who brings peace bring peace to all.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos praised his &quot;relentless&quot; push forward in technology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-container twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1051983010722013184&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@JeffBezos: Very sad to hear of Paul Allen's passing. His passion for invention and pushing forward inspired so many. He was relentless to the end. My heart goes out to Paul's family and friends.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— CNBC's Matt Rosoff, Ryan Ruggiero and Reuters contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen left the company after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. A previous version mischaracterized the timeline of his departure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Removing Old Versions of TLS</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/10/15/removing-old-versions-of-tls/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/10/15/removing-old-versions-of-tls/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In March of 2020, Firefox will disable support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Internet, 20 years is an eternity.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246&quot;&gt;TLS 1.0&lt;/a&gt; will be 20 years old in January 2019.  In that time, TLS has protected billions – and probably trillions – of connections from eavesdropping and attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that time, we have collectively learned a lot about what it takes to design and build a security protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we are not aware of specific problems with TLS 1.0 that require immediate action, several aspects of the design are neither as strong or as robust as we would like given the nature of the Internet today.  Most importantly, TLS 1.0 does not support modern cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) no longer recommends the use of older TLS versions.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate/&quot;&gt;draft document&lt;/a&gt; describes the technical reasons in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will disable &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346&quot;&gt;TLS 1.1&lt;/a&gt; at the same time.  TLS 1.1 only addresses a limitation of TLS 1.0 that can be addressed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/a/24489/106093&quot;&gt;other ways&lt;/a&gt;. Our telemetry shows that only 0.1% of connections use TLS 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2398&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mzl.la/2IQ5j0Y&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2398 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/security/files/2018/10/TLS-Version-Usage-Firefox-Beta-62-August-September-2018-600x371.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph showing the versions that we intend to remove (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) have low usage&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/10/TLS-Version-Usage-Firefox-Beta-62-August-September-2018-600x371.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/10/TLS-Version-Usage-Firefox-Beta-62-August-September-2018-252x156.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/10/TLS-Version-Usage-Firefox-Beta-62-August-September-2018-768x475.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2018/10/TLS-Version-Usage-Firefox-Beta-62-August-September-2018.png 903w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;TLS versions for all connections established by Firefox Beta 62, August-September 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our telemetry shows that many sites already use TLS 1.2 or higher (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/&quot;&gt;Qualys says 94%&lt;/a&gt;).  TLS 1.2 is a prerequisite for HTTP/2, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c274/8de616247677b44815c6a7477afed5c79084.pdf&quot;&gt;can improve site performance&lt;/a&gt;.  We recommend that sites use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility&quot;&gt;modern profile&lt;/a&gt; of TLS 1.2 unless they have specialized needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sites that need to upgrade, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/08/13/tls-1-3-published-in-firefox-today/&quot;&gt;recently released&lt;/a&gt; TLS 1.3 includes an improved core design that has been rigorously analyzed by cryptographers.  TLS 1.3 can also make connections faster than TLS 1.2. Firefox already makes far more connections with TLS 1.3 than with TLS 1.0 and 1.1 combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that these changes will appear in pre-release versions of Firefox (Beta, Developer Edition, and Nightly) earlier than March 2020.  We will announce specific dates when we have more detailed plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that upgrading something as fundamental as TLS can take some time.  This change affects a large number of sites.  That is why we are making this announcement so far in advance of the March 2020 removal date of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other browsers have made similar announcements. &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/modernizing-transport-security.html&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/10/15/modernizing-tls-edge-ie11/&quot;&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webkit.org/blog/8462/deprecation-of-legacy-tls-1-0-and-1-1-versions/&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; all plan to make the same change.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twilio to Acquire Sendgrid</title>
<link>https://www.twilio.com/press/releases/release_twilio_acquires_sendgrid</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.twilio.com/press/releases/release_twilio_acquires_sendgrid</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accelerates Twilio’s Mission to Fuel the Future of Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brings Together the Two Leading Communication Platforms for Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Combination to Create One, Best-in-Class Cloud Communications Platform for Companies to Communicate with Customers Across Every Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twilio &amp;amp; SendGrid Together Serve Millions of Developers, Have 100,000+ Customers, and Have a Greater than $700 Million Annualized Revenue Run Rate*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and SendGrid today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Twilio to acquire SendGrid in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $2 billion. At the exchange ratio of 0.485 shares of Twilio Class A common stock per share of SendGrid common stock, this price equates to approximately $36.92 per share based on today’s closing prices. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the leading email API platform to the leading cloud communications platform can drive tremendous value to the combined customer bases. The resulting company would offer developers a single, best-in-class platform to manage all of their important communication channels -- voice, messaging, video, and now email as well. Together, the companies currently drive more than half a trillion customer interactions annualized*, and growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Increasingly, our customers are asking us to solve all of their strategic communications challenges - regardless of channel. Email is a vital communications channel for companies around the world, and so it was important to us to include this capability in our platform,&quot; said Jeff Lawson, Twilio's co-founder and chief executive officer. &quot;The two companies share the same vision, the same model, and the same values. We believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring together the two leading developer-focused communications platforms to create the unquestioned platform of choice for all companies looking to transform their customer engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tremendous day for all SendGrid customers, employees and shareholders,” said Sameer Dholakia, SendGrid’s chief executive officer. “Our two companies have always shared a common goal - to create powerful communications experiences for businesses by enabling developers to easily embed communications into the software they are building. Our mission is to help our customers deliver communications that drive engagement and growth, and this combination will allow us to accelerate that mission for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details Regarding the Proposed SendGrid Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boards of directors of Twilio and SendGrid have each approved the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the transaction, Twilio Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Twilio, will be merged with and into SendGrid, with SendGrid surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Twilio. At closing, each outstanding share of SendGrid common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.485 shares of Twilio Class A common stock, which represents a per share price for SendGrid common stock of $36.92 based on the closing price of Twilio Class A common stock on October 15, 2018. The exchange ratio represents a 14% premium over the average exchange ratio for the ten calendar days ending, October 15, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

Certain stockholders of SendGrid owning approximately 6% of the outstanding SendGrid shares have entered into voting agreements and certain stockholders of Twilio who control approximately 33% of total Twilio voting power have entered into voting agreements, or proxies, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, to vote in favor of the SendGrid acquisition and the issuance of Twilio shares in connection with the SendGrid acquisition, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
