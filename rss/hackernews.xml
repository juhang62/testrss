<title>Airpods make more money than Spotify, Twitter, Snapchat, and Shopify combined</title>
<link>https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/apple-airpods-iphone-accessory-or-the-next-big-thing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/apple-airpods-iphone-accessory-or-the-next-big-thing</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a startup with $12 billion of revenue, 125%+ YoY revenue growth (two years in a row), and Apple-esque gross margins (30-50%). Without knowing anything else about the business, what would you value it at? $50 billion? $100 billion? More?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Apple’s AirPods business, the fastest-growing segment of the world’s most valuable company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, when Apple released their first ever wireless earbuds called &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2tzks3n&quot;&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, many thought of them as an add-on product that could boost Apple’s average iPhone sales price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was that instead of selling every new phone with earphones included, Apple could sell improved earphones as a second product, without changing the price of the phone. Smart move for an incremental revenue boost, but the magnitude of AirPods success has surpassed all expectations. Now it looks like AirPods could become much more than just an iPhone accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iPhone Sales and Revenue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, Apple has sold roughly 215 million iPhones per year. These phones cost roughly $1,000 each, and therefore generate $215 billion of revenue for Apple each year. This makes up 81% of Apple’s total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AirPods Sales and Revenue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while investors have come to terms with the flat revenue for Apple’s iPhone business, it’s becoming apparent that Apple might have another big hit on their hands. AirPods sales have been beating expectations ever since Apple launched them in December of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Apple doesn’t share sales numbers for AirPods, industry analysts have converged on estimated sales numbers for each of the last 3 years. In 2017, Apple sold an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/12/how-big-can-apples-airpods-business-become/#1a0a65577f89&quot;&gt;15 million devices&lt;/a&gt;, each priced at $150. That gave Apple a $2.25 billion revenue boost, only a 1% boost to Apple’s $215 billion iPhone revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2018, AirPods sales began to quiet Apple bears. &lt;a href=&quot;https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/15/apple-sold-35-million-airpods-in-2018-currently-most-popular-hearable-brand&quot;&gt;35 million pairs&lt;/a&gt; were sold, still priced at $150. That gave Apple an additional $5.25 billion in revenue, then representing 2.4% of iPhone revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2019, Apple has pulled off yet another incredible year of AirPods sales. Apple sold an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019&quot;&gt;60 million units&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2019 the prices increased too. Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/35slL1f&quot;&gt;second generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; launched at $200, and their newest variation, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/37EKRv7&quot;&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; sell for $250. Assuming an even split of sales between Gen 1, Gen 2, and AirPods Pro, Airpods revenue was $12 billion in 2019. That’s 4.5% of Apple’s iPhone revenue. Investors are paying attention now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AirPods Sales Growth And Potential&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because while 4.5% doesn’t sound impressive, it’s 4.5% of the world’s most successful product, which represents almost all the revenue of the $1.3T behemoth that is Apple. And with Apple valued at 5x revenues, a similar multiple would imply the AirPods business is worth $60 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except AirPods sales are growing at triple digit rates each year. In 2018, AirPods revenue grew 133% over 2017, and in 2019 AirPods revenue was up another 128% over 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what AirPods revenue looks like compared to some of the world’s top tech companies. AirPods make as much money as Spotify, Twitter, Snap, and Shopify *combined*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And considering their triple-digit growth two years in a row, I would be shocked if AirPods didn’t earn more money than Uber in 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dfd5aca7badfa129f80056c/5e14ca6b97c44041a7371964_IhGV24h4Vt-uCJTdALL5ChuW-EFFyzoEb7p5CbCntzUloFxLKow_r32opz3xt4C30Td1cx8IY2u9tFaVdd7_1I64kKOSaDkC-Bv3987c6aqqxmsHDZs18lY35gYoxwqP2DGe7sAO.png&quot; alt=&quot;AirPods make more money than Spotify, Twitter, Snap, and Shopify combined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget. AirPods only represent a portion of Apple’s audio business. Apple also owns Beats By Dre, which is responsible for a healthy chunk of the world’s over-ear headphones market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AirPods Impact On Apple’s Business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as investors look forward to anticipate the future impact AirPods will have on Apple’s business, there are a few things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, unit sales of AirPods have significant room to grow from here. 110 million AirPods have been sold since they launched, while Apple’s installed base of iPhones is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/29/apple-iphone-installed-base-900-million/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKJEFO_8j6S7cdSmQLFmmRe9-VCMQwxCfVa79tDRF8SgLjENddzy-g2oIa_u7obJ8mvslH2p8h8BTrJbmcXl0eo4DIgLVZlT-7O8VCPmsrfMfkNyNUPZD8-iZ2_AjmqFR9kcUvRaQtH5rjzx8OH7UavI0U-eFb3cXS0mCvt1Vy5Z&quot;&gt;900 million&lt;/a&gt;. That means almost all iPhone users are still either using wired earphones or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the growth of unit sales is likely already priced in to the stock. It doesn't take a genius to do the math above and figure out that AirPods sales will continue growing from here. The real question that investors should be asking is &quot;what could AirPods become that the world hasn't realized yet?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where new AirPods features become important. Rumors are swirling that Apple may launch an &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/20/sirios-launch-2020-report/&quot;&gt;operating system for AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and apps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ttyl.social&quot;&gt;TTYL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yac.chat&quot;&gt;Yac&lt;/a&gt; are already creating buzz as audio-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple can successfully build an ecosystem of applications around AirPods and audio experiences, Apple will have more freedom to raise prices without lowering demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio experiences could also be a tool for growing Apple’s base of phone buyers. The differences between Apple’s iPhone and all other smartphones is shrinking every year. But new audio experiences could change that and re-ignite growth in Apple’s iPhone sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the combination of higher prices and higher unit sales that the future success of AirPods depends on. New iPhone accessories alone won’t move the needle for Apple in the long run, but the creation of an entire audio ecosystem just might. Keep an eye on AirPods feature improvements, and the possibility of an Apple audio operating system in 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Evaluating State and Local Business Tax Incentives</title>
<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w26603</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nber.org/papers/w26603</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;bibtop&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBER Working Paper No. 26603&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issued in January 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBER Program(s):&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/DAE.html&quot;&gt;Program on the Development of the American Economy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/EFG.html&quot;&gt;Economic Fluctuations and Growth Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/IO.html&quot;&gt;Industrial Organization Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/ITI.html&quot;&gt;International Trade and Investment Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/LS.html&quot;&gt;Labor Studies Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/PE.html&quot;&gt;Public Economics Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/POL.html&quot;&gt;Political Economy Program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papersbyprog/PR.html&quot;&gt;Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay describes and evaluates state and local business tax incentives in the United States. In 2014, states spent between $5 and $216 per capita on incentives for firms in the form of firm-specific subsidies and general tax credits, which mostly target investment, job creation, and research and development. Collectively, these incentives amounted to nearly 40% of state corporate tax revenues for the typical state, but some states' incentive spending exceeded their corporate tax revenues. States with higher per capita incentives tend to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firm-specific incentives are usually large establishments in manufacturing, technology, and high-skilled service industries, and the average discretionary subsidy is $178M for 1,500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are richer, larger, and more urban than the average county, and poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. Comparing “winning” and runner-up locations for each deal in a bigger and more recent sample than in prior work, we find that average employment within the 3-digit industry of the deal increases by roughly 1,500 jobs. While we find some evidence of direct employment gains from attracting a firm, we do not find strong evidence that firm-specific tax incentives increase broader economic growth at the state and local level. Although these incentives are often intended to attract and retain high-spillover firms, the evidence on spillovers and productivity effects of incentives appears mixed. As subsidy-giving has become more prevalent, subsidies are no longer as closely tied to firm investment. If subsidy deals do not lead to high spillovers, justifying these incentives requires substantial equity gains, which are also unclear empirically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Hi HN — I'm 43, and at a bit of a crossroads. I sold my share in a company last year and have been taking time off to figure out my next move, and while I've mostly done startups my whole career, I am considering going for a job at a big tech company (FAANG/Lyft/Stripe/etc.). Does anyone have any experience doing this? I can still keep up coding, but should I do that, or try for management? What skills should I brush up on particularly? Mostly, I am a bit fed up with the stress and uncertainty of startups and looking for something more stable, at least for a while.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The system quickly reorganized the words and sentences into new text. His screen displayed a rapidly increasing tally of the articles generated by his product, which he dubs the “Content Farm Automatic Collection System.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the articles in hand, a set of websites that Peng controlled published them, and his thousands of fake social media accounts spread them across the internet, instantly sending manipulated content into news feeds, messaging app inboxes, and search results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I developed this for manipulating public opinion,” Peng told the Reporter, an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.twreporter.org/a/about-us-english-version&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investigative news site&lt;/a&gt; in Taipei, which partnered with BuzzFeed News for this article. He added that automation and artificial intelligence “can quickly generate traffic and publicity much faster than people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old wore Adidas Yeezy sneakers and a gold Rolex as he sat in a two-story office in the industrial part of Taichung that was filled with feng shui items such as a money frog and lucky bamboo. A riot gun, which uses compressed air to fire nonlethal projectiles, rested on his desk. Peng said he bought it for “recreational purposes.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, he detailed his path from sending spam emails as a 14-year-old to, being recruited to help with the 2018 reelection campaign of Najib Razak, the former prime minister of Malaysia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peng’s clients are companies, brands, political parties, and candidates in Asia. “Customers have money, and I don't care what they buy,&quot; he said. They’re purchasing an end-to-end online manipulation system, which can influence people on a massive scale — resulting in votes cast, products sold, and perceptions changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peng’s product is modeled on automation software he saw in China, which he believes no one else outside the mainland has. But while his technology may be unique, his company, Bravo-Idea, is not. There is now a worldwide industry of PR and marketing firms ready to deploy fake accounts, false narratives, and pseudo news websites for the right price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If disinformation in 2016 was characterized by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Macedonian spammers pushing pro-Trump fake news&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russian trolls running rampant on platforms&lt;/a&gt;, 2020 is shaping up to be the year communications pros for hire provide sophisticated online propaganda operations to anyone willing to pay. Around the globe, politicians, parties, governments, and other clients hire what is known in the industry as “black PR” firms to spread lies and manipulate online discourse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BuzzFeed News review — which looked at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qoxtiT0gRrezrE97tayTN-RKT9pU13uRUwyS6fm80ac/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;account takedowns by platforms that deactivated and investigations by security and research firms&lt;/a&gt; — found that since 2011, at least 27 online &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=2637&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;information operations&lt;/a&gt; have been partially or wholly attributed to PR or marketing firms. Of those, 19 occurred in 2019 alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, in late December, Twitter &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/new-disclosures-to-our-archive-of-state-backed-information-operations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it removed more than 5,000 accounts that it said were part of “a significant state-backed information operation” in Saudi Arabia carried out by marketing firm Smaat. The same &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-georgia-vietnam-and-the-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook announced a takedown of hundreds of accounts, pages, and groups that it found were engaged in “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/inauthentic-behavior-policy-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;foreign and government interference&lt;/a&gt;” on behalf of the government of Georgia. It attributed the operation to Panda, an advertising agency in Georgia, and to the country’s ruling party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, told BuzzFeed News “the professionalization of deception” is a growing threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The broader notion of deception and influence operations has been around for some time, but over the past several years, we have seen [...] companies grow up that basically build their business model around deception,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Although Peng may&lt;/b&gt; be one of the most sophisticated black PR practitioners, he is far from the only one. The Saudi and Georgian revelations followed a drumbeat of similar takedowns of and investigations into marketing and PR firms in countries such as Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Brazil, Indonesia, and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cindyotis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cindy Otis&lt;/a&gt;, a former CIA officer and the author of &lt;i&gt;True or False: A CIA Analyst's Guide to Spotting Fake News&lt;/i&gt;, told BuzzFeed News that information operations by nation-states like Russia and Iran have provided “a playbook for individuals and groups that are financially motivated to delve into this space.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of black PR firms means investigators at platforms, security firms, and within the intelligence community are “spending increasing amounts of time looking at the disinformation-for-hire services that are out there,” said Otis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archimedes Group, an Israeli black PR firm, created networks of hundreds of Facebook pages, accounts, and groups around the world, boasting on its website that it would “use every tool and take every advantage available in order to change reality according to our client’s wishes.” For an election in Mali, it managed a fake fact-checking page that claimed to be run by local students. In Tunisia, it ran a page titled “Stop à la Désinformation et aux Mensonges” (“Stop Disinformation and Lies”). In Nigeria, it ran pages advocating for and against the same politician, former vice president Atiku Abubakar. Researchers &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/dfrlab/inauthentic-israeli-facebook-assets-target-the-world-281ad7254264&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;postulated&lt;/a&gt; that the pro-Abubakar page “was likely designed to identify his supporters in order to target them with anti-Abubakar content later.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the PR firm Pragmatico employed dozens of young, digitally savvy people to pump out positive comments on fake Facebook accounts about clients. In Poland, Cat@Net managed networks of fake Twitter accounts operated by staffers with disabilities working from home, whom the agency hired because it could pay them below-market rates while they received government subsidies. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.investigate-europe.eu/undercover-at-a-troll-farm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reporting by Investigate Europe&lt;/a&gt; also found Cat@Net performed work for one of Poland’s most prominent PR agencies, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://art-media.com.pl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Art-Media&lt;/a&gt;. (The company denied working with Cat@Net.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Puerto Rico, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2019/07/las-889-paginas-de-telegram-entre-rossello-nevares-y-sus-allegados/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;journalists revealed&lt;/a&gt; that former governor Ricardo Rosselló was an administrator of a Telegram group chat where a consultant from marketing firm KOI &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/dfrlab/from-telegram-to-twitter-top-puerto-rican-officials-plotted-possible-information-operation-a899a00e078e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appeared to plan and direct social media campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to push pro-government messages and attack rivals. In August, Rosselló resigned, in part over widespread outrage over the chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peng’s career is&lt;/b&gt; a road map of how online manipulation services evolved from solo operations to agencies that openly advertise their services and employ large staffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 14 years old, he wrote an email spam program to stuff mailboxes of people in Taiwan. “Using 30 computers I had in a room, I became a very big player in sending spam,” Peng said. “I think 1 of every 2 people in Taiwan has received junk mails that I was responsible for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school, he created software to spam popular internet message boards with offers, labeling the product as an &quot;Automatic Bulletin Posting Kit.” One ad asked visitors to porn sites, &quot;Do you know that excessive masturbation can cause impotence and premature ejaculation?&quot; Peng said the fearmongering ad helped drive sales for male enhancement pills he was promoting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peng created thousands of fake accounts on popular Chinese message boards to promote his and his clients’ products. He soon began making and selling websites and counseling via Skype on how to make money online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hosted so many that I even lost my voice! I was a high school student then, and my mother was wondering what I was doing speaking on the phone all day,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, singers from schools across Taiwan competed in a popular TV competition. Peng’s alma mater won; its performer received more than 41 million online votes, almost twice the Taiwanese population. A school official confirmed to the Reporter that the school had requested help from Peng in the competition but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, Peng has been developing his “Content Farm Automatic Collection System.” His clients use his system to overwhelm their chosen corners of the internet with torrents of AI-generated text that influence search results. Peng perfected the system by buying the services of every social media and SEO manipulation offering he could find on Taobao, a huge Chinese e-commerce site owned by Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was scammed a few times in the beginning because I didn’t really understand the software,” he said. “Many of them were fake or useless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peng instructed his six developers to build a system inspired by the best of what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This marketing logic is in response to China’s huge population of 1.4 billion people, [where content] only gets eyeballs when there is volume,” he said. “In comparison, there are only 23 million people in Taiwan. Applying this logic, I will create the largest volume in the shortest amount of time, and the information I spread will reach everyone’s eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While Peng focuses on&lt;/b&gt; automation, black PR firms elsewhere rely on manual labor, using brute force with what he does with code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For investigative reporter Vasil Bidun, that meant an eight-hour shift in the trendy Podil neighborhood of Kyiv. He would log on to different fake Facebook accounts to comment in favor of candidates, criticize their opponents, or steer conversations in specific directions. Ukraine’s presidential election was underway, and he said his employer, Pragmatico, seemed to have secured contracts with several people running for office. (All politicians asked about the troll farm have denied involvement.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aim is to get an emotional reaction from a person,” Bidun said in an interview. “If they read a comment, even [if they understand] that it was written by a bot, it could have affected them emotionally and it becomes more difficult for them to control themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bidun wasn’t just punching the clock at the agency. After &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egIjW5jBATA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR2RpcY_bb6ry-L1jdqlF0vHBMmyiA_KAo52O6OiZcx9dewzHWFdD2MDeRg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three months working undercover at the agency&lt;/a&gt;, he &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/inside-a-ukrainian-troll-farm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published an in-depth investigation&lt;/a&gt;. He and roughly 50 other Pragmatico employees worked in a single apartment, rotating in three shifts. It was mostly students trying to earn extra money, just over $300 per month, he said. No one talked about the ethics of the work — they just did what they were told, promoting the candidacies of both conservative and progressive politicians, including popular musician Svyatoslav Vakarchuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the summer break and it was a method to earn a bit of money,” he said. “Most don’t think much about the consequences their work can have; they just write.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days before Bidun’s investigation was published in September 2019, Facebook &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-iraq-and-ukraine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced the removal&lt;/a&gt; of the firm's assets on the platform, which amounted to 168 accounts, 149 pages, and 79 groups. The social media giant also revealed that Pragmatico had spent $1.6 million on ads, a significant sum for the Ukrainian market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But black PR continues to flourish on social media in other parts of Eastern Europe. This year, while reporting for Investigate Europe, Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.investigate-europe.eu/undercover-at-a-troll-farm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spent six months undercover&lt;/a&gt; working for Cat@Net, a Polish company that describes itself as an “ePR agency comprising specialists who build a positive image of companies, private individuals and public institutions — mostly in social media.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cat@Net said it was a PR company, but in reality it was [a] troll farm. They did fake accounts,” she told BuzzFeed News. (The company denied it was a troll farm in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://catatnet.pl/o-nas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement posted to its website&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pruszkiewicz said she and her colleagues used fake Twitter and Facebook accounts to deliver work for the firms’ clients. This meant promoting Polish state media, pumping up the left-wing politicians who hired them, or attacking the government’s decision to place an order for American F-35 fighter jets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cat@Net’s staffers worked remotely, congregating in Slack to receive their assignments. Sometimes a professional copywriter would provide them content, but many times it was up to employees to come up with messages for the fake accounts. Team members would celebrate each other’s successes, such as “when someone important like a politician answered a comment from the fake accounts,” Pruszkiewicz said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cat@Net focused on hiring people with disabilities because they could be paid less and qualified for government subsidies, according to Pruszkiewicz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are in a wheelchair and have bills to pay. They are often without professional skills, and Cat@Net gave them work and got from the state a lot of money for [employing] these people,” she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her reporting was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.pl/polska/farma-trolli-catnet-pelna-lista-falszywych-kont-z-farmy-trolli-catnet-sledztwo-ws/wkw2g3b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published in October 2019 in Newsweek Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the Polish government opened an investigation into the company for the disability benefits it received. However, Twitter accounts run by Cat@Net are still online, Pruszkiewicz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fake accounts still exist today and are writing on Twitter like nothing happened, and every day I can see what they are writing on Twitter and Facebook. It’s really frustrating, because I spent six months [investigating] and the company still exists,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nowhere is the&lt;/b&gt; rise of black PR firms more intertwined with marketing and politics than in the Philippines. Many legitimate-seeming agencies here offer black PR services that include fake social media accounts, websites, and coordinated harassment campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Facebook announced takedowns of properties attributed to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/01/banning-twinmark-media-enterprises/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twinmark Media Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, a digital marketing company in the Philippines, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-removes-inauthentic-engagement-philippines-nic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nic Gabunada&lt;/a&gt;, the social media director for Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 campaign. In both cases, Facebook said the operations were engaged in “coordinated inauthentic activity.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabunada &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-philippines-dutertes-drug-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; insisted in an interview with BuzzFeed News that the Facebook engagement for Duterte’s campaign had been “organic” and “volunteer-driven.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/2020-philippines-disinformation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously reported by BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;, some politicians who had decried Duterte’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-philippines-dutertes-drug-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use of fake Facebook accounts and trolling in 2016&lt;/a&gt; had used social media manipulation services in their own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black PR services have become so lucrative in the Philippines that many PR firms feel pressured to offer them. One agency director told BuzzFeed News it’s “tempting” to offer black PR services because of the potential profit. It’s difficult to compete against companies who deliver these services, she added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've had several campaigns where we were up against other firms that were willing to employ any kind of tactic to combat whatever we were putting out there if we were promoting a candidate and they were promoting an opposing candidate, for instance,” said the agency director, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Corpus Ong, an associate professor of global digital media at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has been studying black PR firms and trolling in the Philippines for years. “The Philippines offers a cautionary tale for other countries for what happens when disinformation production within the PR industry has become so financially lucrative that they have moved from shady black market transactions to the professional respectability of the corporate boardroom,” he told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ong said PR firms use industry jargon while communicating with clients to help “neutralize the stigma of the real disinformation work that they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, they would use the terms ‘supplemental pages’ and ‘digital support workers’ to describe what is otherwise known as ‘fake news sites’ or ‘paid trolls’ when they pitch their services to prospective clients. This lends an aura of respectability to the transaction and — crucially — gives politicians a level of plausible deniability,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rise of black PR&lt;/b&gt; firms is on the radar of the global PR industry, which &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/this-public-relations-firm-has-been-secretly-placing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/15/opinion/deception-on-capitol-hill.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/business/bell-pottinger-guptas-zuma-south-africa.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.odwyerpr.com/story/public/9826/2017-12-01/pr-played-key-role-rebirth-kkk.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prweek.com/article/100410/pinochet-hires-robertson-turn-media-tide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-a-us-agency-cleaned-up-rwandas-genocide-stained-image/article542612/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/62a10a9b5bce4c49b9785505240bf384&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;making&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, the industry took a stand against social media manipulation when the Public Relations and Communications Association &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/04/bell-pottinger-expelled-from-pr-trade-body-after-south-africa-racism-row&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; Bell Pottinger, a now-defunct London-based PR firm, after investigating its work &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/24/bell-pottinger-south-africa-claims-pr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, where the firm stoked racial tensions in service of a billionaire client. Bell Pottinger previously received a $500 million contract from the Pentagon to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://labs.thebureauinvestigates.com/fake-news-and-false-flags/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;execute a top secret propaganda program in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global agencies often look to industry rules. Jill Tannenbaum, the chief communications and marketing officer for PR giant Weber Shandwick, told BuzzFeed News that the company must “engage audiences with campaigns that are rooted in truth,” even when it “compete[s] in markets where dishonest tactics take place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a process in place to assess any client engagements that might not adhere to our values or include tactics that are not truthful or transparent, so we can counsel our teams and our clients accordingly,” she said in a statement. “Our local leaders – in the Philippines and around the world – are empowered to turn away work that is of concern or that does not adhere to our values.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Bell Pottinger expulsion, the International Communications Consultancy Organisation, an umbrella organization representing PR trade groups around the world, established 10 principles known as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://iccopr.com/helsinki-declaration/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Helsinki Declaration&lt;/a&gt;. They require communication professionals to “be aware of the power of social media, and use it responsibly” and to “never engage in the creation of or knowingly circulate fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis Ingham, director general of the PRCA and chief executive of the ICCO, told BuzzFeed News that black PR firms give ethical practitioners a bad name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our members are furious that they are ever tainted with the stain of these people who operate outside of [the industry's] ethical parameters,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the increasing number of information operations being attributed to PR or marketing firms, Ingham said, these firms are the exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I recognize there will always be a tiny percentage of people who call themselves PR or marketing practitioners who operate in the gray or black area,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the legitimate PR industry works to differentiate itself from these practitioners, platforms are finding it increasingly difficult to prune black PR from their ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the company is working on multiple platforms and has a wide range of business interests, we might not be able to completely destroy them,” said Facebook’s Gleicher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Facebook’s approach is to remove assets involved in a specific operation and ban the entire organization. In some cases, Facebook also bans key employees from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason we do that is making it very clear that it’s not going to be a profitable business model on our platform,” Gleicher said. “You build a business around this, we will remove you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peng, however, is undeterred. He said it’s easy to evade Facebook’s controls, and that demand for his services remains strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think cracking Facebook is quite easy. My software is developed to constantly fight against Facebook,” he said. “This is done because there are markets, customers, and needs, and people have money to pay for the service. We do it because there is a demand.” ●&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Major union launches campaign to organize video game and tech workers</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-07/major-union-launches-campaign-to-organize-video-game-and-tech-workers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-07/major-union-launches-campaign-to-organize-video-game-and-tech-workers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The last two years have witnessed a wave of walkouts, petitions and other workplace actions at video game and tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite this &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-11-06/google-employee-walkout-tech-industry-activism&quot;&gt;swell in labor activism,&lt;/a&gt; employees at no major video game studios and only a handful of tech offices have formally voted to form or join a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new campaign launched Tuesday by one of the nation’s largest labor unions — and spearheaded by one of the leading video game industry activists in Southern California — aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE for short) is a new project of the Communications Workers of America aimed specifically at unionizing video game and tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It grew out of conversations between the CWA and Game Workers Unite, a grass-roots organization that sprang up in 2018 to push for wall-to-wall unionization of the $43-billion video game industry, alongside conversations with organizers across the larger tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate from the new initiative, the Toronto chapter of GWU has also signed a formal partnership agreement with CWA to work on organizing in the area. (CWA is also the parent union of the NewsGuild, which represents workers at the L.A. Times and most major newspapers in the country.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been watching the amazing organizing of workers across the industry,” said Tom Smith, CWA’s lead organizer. “And workers themselves reached out to us while doing that amazing self-organizing, and said, ‘Can we do this in partnership with the CWA?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union declined to specify how much money it was putting behind the new effort, but has put two organizers on payroll to lead the push with support from dozens of CWA staff members across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the new staffers, Wes McEnany, comes from a more traditional labor organizing career with Boston-area unions and the labor-backed campaign for a $15 minimum wage. CWA also hired Emma Kinema, who co-founded Game Workers Unite and organized the Los Angeles and Orange County chapters of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dedicated staff and national ambition set the CODE project apart from other efforts to organize tech workers, such as the United Steelworkers-backed Pittsburgh Assn. of Tech Professionals, which successfully &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xwmnv/google-contractors-officially-vote-to-unionize&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unionized Google subcontractors&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my experience self-organizing in the game industry, people are very bottlenecked by the lack of resources and lack of legal know-how and a lack of funding — it’s very tough,” Kinema said. “The decades of experience and resources that come from partnering with an organization like CWA can take it to the next level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working conditions in the video game industry have brought the question of unionization to the forefront in recent years. At a &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-video-game-union-movement-20190412-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2019 video game developer conference,&lt;/a&gt; the industry’s practice of making employees work 100-hour weeks for months on end to finish a game in time for the preset delivery date, often without extra pay — a practice known as “crunch” — came under fire in discussions among workers, as did the rolling layoffs that come when companies staff up and shed jobs to fit cyclical production schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the tech industry writ large, workplace actions have extended beyond concerns over bread-and-butter issues such as pay and severance to questions of ethics and culture. &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-11-06/google-employee-walkout-tech-industry-activism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The worldwide Google walkouts&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-riot-games-walkout-protest-forced-arbitration-20190506-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;walkout at Los Angeles game studio Riot Games&lt;/a&gt; that followed, grew out of employee demands to end the practice of forcing workers into private arbitration instead of allowing them to sue over &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-02/riot-games-gender-discrimination-settlement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claims of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other actions, such as the &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-wayfair-walkout-border-beds-20190625-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;walkout at online furniture seller Wayfair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-hololens-defense-army-contract-20190222-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a number of petitions&lt;/a&gt; filed by workers at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, have pushed back against corporate decisions to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Defense. And Irvine-based Activision Blizzard &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/blizzard-employees-blizzcon-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;faced internal and external protests&lt;/a&gt; in late 2019 after it punished a professional gamer who made statements supporting the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers behind the new effort see the push for better working conditions and corporate ethics as one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a false dichotomy to frame the activism of a lot of tech workers around the impact that the work they do has on society as something other than a fundamental working condition,” Smith said. “For a lot of folks, that’s what led them to do this work in the first place, and people are feeling a disconnect between their personal values and what they’re seeing every day in their working lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, CWA &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-03/fired-google-workers-plan-to-file-a-federal-labor-complaint&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filed official charges&lt;/a&gt; against Google with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of five Google workers who were fired in what they say was retaliation for their organizing at the tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new project charts a path away from organizing video game workers along the Hollywood craft union model. SAG-AFTRA has represented video game voice actors for years, and &lt;a class=&quot;Link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-sag-aftra-video-games-strike20170925-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called a strike in 2017&lt;/a&gt; over pay and royalty structures. But CWA largely follows the industrial union model, which organizes entire companies at once rather than splitting workers who perform different jobs into specialized unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith, for his part, said that CWA could accommodate craft-based organizing if that’s what video game or tech workers want, emphasizing that the workers will ultimately decide how to organize. But Kinema saw the decision to join CWA in starker terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe workers are strongest when they’re together in one shop in one union, so the disciplines can’t be pitted against each other—none of that’s good for the workers,” Kinema said. “I think in games and tech the wall-to-wall industrial model is the best fit.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Translating Quake 3 into Rust</title>
<link>https://immunant.com/blog/2020/01/quake3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://immunant.com/blog/2020/01/quake3/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://immunant.com/images/blog/2020/01/frag.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Animated GIF of Rust Quake3 gameplay&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust-loving team at Immunant has been hard at work on C2Rust, a migration framework that takes the drudgery out of migrating to Rust. Our goal is to make safety improvements to the translated Rust automatically where we can, and help the programmer do the same where we cannot. First, however, we have to build a rock-solid translator that gets people up and running in Rust. Testing on small CLI programs gets old eventually, so we decided to try translating Quake 3 into Rust. After a couple of days, we were likely the first people to ever play Quake3 in Rust!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-the-stage-quake-3-sources&quot;&gt;Setting the stage: Quake 3 sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at the original Quake 3 source code and various forks, we settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ioquake3.org/&quot;&gt;ioquake3&lt;/a&gt;. It is a community fork of Quake 3 that is still maintained and builds on modern platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, we made sure we could build the project as is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ make release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ioquake3 build produces a few different libraries and executables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ tree --prune -I missionpack -P &quot;*.so|*x86_64&quot;
.
└── build
    └── debug-linux-x86_64
        ├── baseq3
        │   ├── cgamex86_64.so          # client
        │   ├── qagamex86_64.so         # game server
        │   └── uix86_64.so             # ui
        ├── ioq3ded.x86_64              # dedicated server binary
        ├── ioquake3.x86_64             # main binary
        ├── renderer_opengl1_x86_64.so  # opengl1 renderer
        └── renderer_opengl2_x86_64.so  # opengl2 renderer
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these libraries, the UI, client, and server libraries can be built as either &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php&quot;&gt;Quake VM&lt;/a&gt; assembly or native X86 shared libraries. We opted to use the native versions of these libraries for our project. Translating just the VM into Rust and using the QVM versions would have been significantly simpler but we wanted to thoroughly test out C2Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on the UI, game, client, OpenGL1 renderer and main binary for our translation. It would be possible to translate the OpenGL2 renderer as well, but we chose to skip it as it makes significant use of &lt;code&gt;.glsl&lt;/code&gt; shader files which the build system embeds as literal strings in C source code. While we could add custom build script support for embedding the GLSL code into Rust strings after we transpile, there's not a good automatic way to transpile these autogenerated, temporary files&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;. We instead just translated the OpenGL1 renderer library and forced the game to use it instead of the default renderer. Finally, we decided to skip the dedicated server and mission pack files, as they wouldn't be hard to translate but were also not necessary for our demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transpiling-quake-3&quot;&gt;Transpiling Quake 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve the directory structure used by Quake 3 and not need to change its source code, we needed to produce exactly the same binaries as the native build, meaning four shared libraries and one executable. Since C2Rust produces Cargo build files, each binary needs its own Rust crate with a corresponding &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file. For C2Rust to produce one crate per output binary, it would need a list of the binaries along with their corresponding object or source files, and linker invocation used to produce each binary (used to determine other details like library dependencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we quickly ran into one limitation with the way C2Rust intercepts the native build process: C2Rust takes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html&quot;&gt;compilation database&lt;/a&gt; file as an input, which contains a list of compilation commands executed during the build. However, this database &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; contains compilation commands, and not any linker invocations. Most tools that produce this database have this intentional limitation, e.g., &lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bear&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;compiledb&lt;/code&gt;. To our knowledge, the only tool that does include linking commands is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/tree/master/analyzer/tools/build-logger&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;build-logger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;code&gt;CodeChecker&lt;/code&gt;, which we didn't use because we only learned about it after writing our own wrappers (described below). This meant that we couldn't use a &lt;code&gt;compile_commands.json&lt;/code&gt; file produced by any of the common tools to transpile a multi-binary C program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we wrote our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/scripts/cc-wrappers/cc&quot;&gt;compiler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/scripts/cc-wrappers/ld&quot;&gt;linker&lt;/a&gt; wrapper scripts that dump out all compiler and linker invocations to a database, and then convert that into an extended &lt;code&gt;compile_commands.json&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of the normal build using a command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ make release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we add wrappers to intercept the build using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ make release CC=/path/to/C2Rust/scripts/cc-wrappers/cc
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrappers produce a directory full of JSON files, one per invocation. A second &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/scripts/convert_build_commands.py&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; aggregates all of them into a new &lt;code&gt;compile_commands.json&lt;/code&gt; file that contains both compilation and linking commands. We then extended C2Rust to read the linking commands from the database, and produce a separate crate per linked binary. Additionally, C2Rust now also reads the library dependencies of each binary and automatically adds them to that crate's &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quality of life improvement, all of the binaries can be built all at once by having them within a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html&quot;&gt;workspace&lt;/a&gt;. C2Rust produces a top-level workspace &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file, so we can build the project with a single &lt;code&gt;cargo build&lt;/code&gt; command in the &lt;code&gt;quake3-rs&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-a-few-papercuts&quot;&gt;Fixing a few Papercuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first tried to build the translated code, we hit a couple of issues with the Quake 3 sources, hitting corner cases that C2Rust couldn't handle (correctly or at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pointers-to-arrays&quot;&gt;Pointers to Arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few places, the original source code contains expressions that point one past the last element of an array. Here is a simplified example of the C code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;int array[1024];
int *p;

// ...

if (p &amp;gt;= &amp;amp;array[1024]) {
   // error...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C standard (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iso-9899.info/n1570.html&quot;&gt;C11, Section 6.5.6&lt;/a&gt;) allows pointers to an element one past the end of the array. However, Rust forbids this, even if we are only taking the address of the element. We found examples of this pattern in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/quake3-rs/code/botlib/be_aas_sample.c#L645&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AAS_TraceClientBBox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler also flagged a similar but actually buggy example in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/quake3-rs/code/game/g_mover.c#L131&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;G_TryPushingEntity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the conditional is &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. The out of bounds pointer was then dereferenced after the conditional, which is an actual memory safety bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this issue in the future, we fixed the C2Rust transpiler to use pointer arithmetic to calculate the address of an array element instead of using an array indexing operation. With this fix, code that uses this “address of element past the array end” pattern will now correctly translate and run with no modifications necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flexible-array-members&quot;&gt;Flexible Array Members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started up a game to test things out and immediately got a panic from Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 4 but the index is 4', quake3-client/src/cm_polylib.rs:973:17
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at &lt;code&gt;cm_polylib.c&lt;/code&gt;, we noticed that it was dereferencing the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; field in the following struct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot;&gt;typedef struct
{
        int             numpoints;
        vec3_t  p[4];           // variable sized
} winding_t;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; field in this struct is a pre-C99 non-compliant version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member&quot;&gt;“flexible array member”&lt;/a&gt; which is still accepted by &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;. C2Rust recognizes flexible array members with the C99 syntax (&lt;code&gt;vec3_t p[]&lt;/code&gt;) and implements simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/c2rust-transpile/src/c_ast/mod.rs#L363&quot;&gt;heuristics&lt;/a&gt; to also detect some pre-C99 versions of this pattern (0- and 1-sized arrays at the end of structures; we also found a few of those in the ioquake3 source code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/commit/ace1fae43e736613544c8d33cc69dee794f5124a&quot;&gt;Changing&lt;/a&gt; the above struct to C99 syntax fixed the panic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot;&gt;typedef struct
{
        int             numpoints;
        vec3_t  p[];            // variable sized
} winding_t;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to automatically fix this pattern in the general case (arrays of sizes other that 0 or 1) would be extremely difficult, since we would have to distinguish between regular arrays and flexible array members of arbitrary sizes. Instead, we recommend that the original C code is fixed manually — just like we did for ioquake3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tied-operands-in-inline-assembly&quot;&gt;Tied Operands in Inline Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of crashes was this C inline assembly code from the &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/bits/select.h&lt;/code&gt; system header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot;&gt;# define __FD_ZERO(fdsp)                                            \
  do {                                                              \
    int __d0, __d1;                                                 \
    __asm__ __volatile__ (&quot;cld; rep; &quot; __FD_ZERO_STOS               \
                          : &quot;=c&quot; (__d0), &quot;=D&quot; (__d1)                \
                          : &quot;a&quot; (0), &quot;0&quot; (sizeof (fd_set)           \
                                          / sizeof (__fd_mask)),    \
                            &quot;1&quot; (&amp;amp;__FDS_BITS (fdsp)[0])             \
                          : &quot;memory&quot;);                              \
  } while (0)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which defines the internal version of the &lt;code&gt;__FD_ZERO&lt;/code&gt; macro. This definition hits a rare corner case of &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; inline assembly: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html#InputOperands&quot;&gt;tied input/output operands&lt;/a&gt; with different sizes. The &lt;code&gt;&quot;=D&quot; (__d1)&lt;/code&gt; output operand binds the &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; register to the &lt;code&gt;__d1&lt;/code&gt; variable as a 32-bit value, while &lt;code&gt;&quot;1&quot; (&amp;amp;__FDS_BITS (fdsp)[0])&lt;/code&gt; binds the same register to the address of &lt;code&gt;fdsp-&amp;gt;fds_bits&lt;/code&gt; as a 64-bit pointer. &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt; fix this mismatch by using the 64-bit register &lt;code&gt;rdi&lt;/code&gt; instead and then truncating its value before the assignment to &lt;code&gt;__d1&lt;/code&gt;, while Rust defaults to LLVM's semantics which leave this case undefined. What we saw happening for debug builds (but not release builds, which behaved correctly) was that both operands would be assigned to the &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; register, causing the pointer to be truncated to 32 bits before the inline assembly, which would cause crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt; passes Rust inline assembly to LLVM with very few changes, we decided to fix this particular case in C2Rust. We implemented a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/tree/master/c2rust-asm-casts&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;c2rust-asm-casts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; crate that fixes the issue above via the Rust type system using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/blob/master/c2rust-asm-casts/src/lib.rs#L13&quot;&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt; and some helper functions that automatically extend and truncate the values of tied operands to an internal size that is large enough to hold both operands. The code above correctly transpiles to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-Rust&quot;&gt;let mut __d0: c_int = 0;
let mut __d1: c_int = 0;
// Reference to the output value of the first operand
let fresh5 = &amp;amp;mut __d0;
// The internal storage for the first tied operand
let fresh6;
// Reference to the output value of the second operand
let fresh7 = &amp;amp;mut __d1;
// The internal storage for the second tied operand
let fresh8;
// Input value of the first operand
let fresh9 = (::std::mem::size_of::&amp;lt;fd_set&amp;gt;() as c_ulong).wrapping_div(::std::mem::size_of::&amp;lt;__fd_mask&amp;gt;() as c_ulong);
// Input value of the second operand
let fresh10 = &amp;amp;mut *fdset.__fds_bits.as_mut_ptr().offset(0) as *mut __fd_mask;
asm!(&quot;cld; rep; stosq&quot;
     : &quot;={cx}&quot; (fresh6), &quot;={di}&quot; (fresh8)
     : &quot;{ax}&quot; (0),
       // Cast the input operands into the internal storage type
       // with optional zero- or sign-extension
       &quot;0&quot; (AsmCast::cast_in(fresh5, fresh9)),
       &quot;1&quot; (AsmCast::cast_in(fresh7, fresh10))
     : &quot;memory&quot;
     : &quot;volatile&quot;);
// Cast the operands out (types are inferred) with truncation
AsmCast::cast_out(fresh5, fresh9, fresh6);
AsmCast::cast_out(fresh7, fresh10, fresh8);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the code above does not require the types for any input or output values in the assembly statement, relying instead on Rust's type inference to resolve those types (mainly the types of &lt;code&gt;fresh6&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fresh8&lt;/code&gt; above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;aligned-global-variables&quot;&gt;Aligned Global Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final source of crashes we encountered was the following global variable that stores a SSE constant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot;&gt;static unsigned char ssemask[16] __attribute__((aligned(16))) =
{
        &quot;\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\x00\x00\x00\x00&quot;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust currently supports the alignment attribute on structure types, but not on global variables, i.e., &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; items. We are looking into ways to solve this in the general case in either Rust or C2Rust, but have decided to fix this issue manually for ioquake3 with a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/master/asm-snapvector.patch&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; file for now. This patch file replaces the Rust equivalent of &lt;code&gt;ssemask&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-Rust&quot;&gt;#[repr(C, align(16))]
struct SseMask([u8; 16]);
static mut ssemask: SseMask = SseMask([
    255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0,
]);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-quake3-rs&quot;&gt;Running quake3-rs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt; emits the binaries, but they are all emitted under &lt;code&gt;target/release&lt;/code&gt; using a directory structure that the &lt;code&gt;ioquake3&lt;/code&gt; binary does not recognize. We wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/master/make_quake3_rs_links.sh&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; that creates symbolic links in the current directory to replicate the correct directory structure (including links to the &lt;code&gt;.pk3&lt;/code&gt; files containing the game assets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ /path/to/make_quake3_rs_links.sh /path/to/quake3-rs/target/release /path/to/paks
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/path/to/paks&lt;/code&gt; path should point to a directory containing the &lt;code&gt;.pk3&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's run the game! We need to pass &lt;code&gt;+set vm_game 0&lt;/code&gt;, etc., so that we load these modules as Rust shared libraries instead of QVM assembly, and &lt;code&gt;cl_renderer&lt;/code&gt; to use the OpenGL1 renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ ./ioquake3 +set sv_pure 0 +set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui 0 +set cl_renderer &quot;opengl1&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://immunant.com/images/blog/2020/01/quake3_startup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image of Quake3 console startup running in Rust&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have Quake3 running in Rust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may browse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/tree/transpiled/quake3-rs&quot;&gt;transpiled sources&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;transpiled&lt;/code&gt; branch of our repository. We also provide the &lt;code&gt;refactored&lt;/code&gt; branch containing the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/tree/refactored/quake3-rs&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/transpiled/refactor_commands.txt&quot;&gt;refactoring commands&lt;/a&gt; pre-applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transpiling-instructions&quot;&gt;Transpiling Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try translating Quake 3 and run it yourself, please be aware that you will need to own the original Quake 3 game assets or download the demo assets from the web. You'll also need to install C2Rust (the required Rust nightly version at the time of writing is &lt;code&gt;nightly-2019-12-05&lt;/code&gt;, but we recommend you check the C2Rust &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/c2rust&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/c2rust&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; for the latest one):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ cargo +nightly-2019-12-05 install c2rust
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and copies of our C2Rust and ioquake3 repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ff8f6ebdff8f6ebf7eafdb1fcf0f2&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;:immunant/c2rust.git
$ git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0f68667b4f68667b677a6d216c6062&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;:immunant/ioq3.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to installing &lt;code&gt;c2rust&lt;/code&gt; with the command above, you may build C2Rust manually using &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt;. In either case, the C2Rust repository is still required as it contains the compiler wrapper scripts that are required to transpile ioquake3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immunant/ioq3/blob/master/transpile.sh&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; that automatically transpiles the C code and applies the &lt;code&gt;ssemask&lt;/code&gt; patch. To use it, run the following command from the top level of the &lt;code&gt;ioq3&lt;/code&gt; repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ ./transpile.sh &amp;lt;/path/to/C2Rust repository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/path/to/c2rust binary&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command should produce a &lt;code&gt;quake3-rs&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory containing the Rust code, where you can subsequently run &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt; and the rest of the steps described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue to develop C2Rust, we'd love to hear what you want to see translated next. Drop us a line at &lt;a href=&quot;https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f1b0a0e022f0602021a010e011b410c0002&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;097d6c6864496064647c6768677d276a6664&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and let us know! If you have legacy C code you need modernized and translated, the team here at Immunant is here to help. We are available for consulting and contracting engagements ranging from one-time support to full-service code modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The first chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1</title>
<link>https://sha-mbles.github.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sha-mbles.github.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We have computed the very first &lt;strong&gt;chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1&lt;/strong&gt;. In a nutshell, this means a complete and practical break of the SHA-1 hash function, with dangerous practical implications if you are still using this hash function. To put it in another way: all attacks that are practical on MD5 are now also practical on SHA-1. Check our paper &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity-improvements&quot;&gt;Complexity Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have significantly improved the complexity of SHA-1 attacks, with a speedup factor around 10. More precisely, we have reduced the cost of a collision attack from 2&lt;sup&gt;64.7&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;61.2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the cost of a chosen-prefix collision attack from 2&lt;sup&gt;67.1&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;63.4&lt;/sup&gt; (on a GTX 970 GPU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;record-computation&quot;&gt;Record Computation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented the entire chosen-prefix collision attack with those improvements. This attack is extremely technical, contains many details, various steps, and requires a lot of engineering work. In order to perform this computation with a small academic budget, we rented cheap gaming or mining GPUs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpuserversrental.com/&quot;&gt;GPUserversrental&lt;/a&gt;, rather that the datacenter-grade hardware used by big cloud providers. We have successfully run the computation during two months last summer, using 900 GPUs (Nvidia GTX 1060).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side result, this shows that it now costs less than 100k USD to break cryptography with a security level of 64 bits (i.e. to compute 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; operations of symmetric cryptography).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pgpgnupg-impersonation&quot;&gt;PGP/GnuPG Impersonation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the PGP/GnuPG Web of Trust as demonstration of our chosen-prefix collision attack against SHA-1. The Web of Trust is a trust model used for PGP that relies on users signing each other’s identity certificate, instead of using a central PKI. For compatibility reasons the legacy branch of GnuPG (version 1.4) still uses SHA-1 by default for identity certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our SHA-1 chosen-prefix collision, we have created two PGP keys with different UserIDs and colliding certificates: key B is a legitimate key for Bob (to be signed by the Web of Trust), but the signature can be transferred to key A which is a forged key with Alice’s ID. The signature will still be valid because of the collision, but Bob controls key A with the name of Alice, and signed by a third party. Therefore, he can impersonate Alice and sign any document in her name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have create a chosen-prefix collision with prefixes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;99040d047fe81780012000&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;99030d047fe81780011800&lt;/code&gt; (in hexadecimal notation). You can download the two messages below, and verify their hash with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sha1sum&lt;/code&gt; tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prefixes have been chosen to build two PGP public keys with colliding SHA-1 certification signatures. You can download two example keys below, with different user names, and examine them with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pgpdump -i&lt;/code&gt; to see that the SHA-1 signatures issued by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xAFBB1FED6951A956&lt;/code&gt; are the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid malicious usage, the keys have a creation date far in the future; if you want to analyse them with pgp, you can use options &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--ignore-time-conflict --ignore-valid-from&lt;/code&gt; (more generally you can prefix arbitrary commands with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;faketime @2145920400&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have tried to contact the authors of affected software before announcing this attack, but due to limited resources, we could not notify everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gnupg&quot;&gt;GnuPG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have first discussed this attack with the GnuPG developers the 9th of May 2019 and eventually informed them of the newly found chosen-prefix collision the 1st of October 2019. The issue is tracked with CVE number CVE-2019-14855. A countermeasure has been implemented in commit edc36f5, included in GnuPG version 2.2.18 (released on the 25th of November 2019): SHA-1-based identity signatures created after 2019-01-19 are now considered invalid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cacert&quot;&gt;CAcert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cacert.org/&quot;&gt;CAcert&lt;/a&gt; is one of them main CAs for PGP keys. We noticed that there is a large number of keys with recent SHA-1 signatures from CAcert on public keyservers. This seems to indicate that they still use SHA-1 to sign user keys. We have first contacted them by email on December 14th, and got an answer on January 6th acknowledging this issue. They are planning a switch to a secure hash function for key certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openssl&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have contacted the OpenSSL developers on December 14th. They are considering disabling SHA-1 at security level 1 (defined as 80-bit security) after our attack. Since security level 1 is the default configuration, this would prevent SHA-1 usage for certificates, and for handshake signatures. Debian Linux had previously set the default configuration to security level 2 (defined as 112-bit security) in the latest release (Debian Buster); this already prevents dangerous usage of SHA-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-chosen-prefix-collision&quot;&gt;What is a chosen-prefix collision?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classical collision (or identical-prefix collision) for a hash function H is simply two messages M and M’ that lead to the same hash output: H(M) = H(M’). Even though this security notion is fundamental in cryptography, exploiting a classical collision for attacks in practice is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chosen-prefix collision is a more constrained (and much more difficult to obtain) type of collision, where two message prefixes P and P’ are first given as challenge to the adversary, and his goal is then to compute two messages M and M’ such that H(P || M) = H(P’ || M’), where || denotes concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such an ability, the attacker can obtain a collision even though prefixes can be chosen arbitrarily (and thus potentially contain some meaningful information). This is particularly impactful when the hash function is used in a digital signature scheme, one of the most common usage of a hash function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-sha-1-really-still-used&quot;&gt;Is SHA-1 really still used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHA-1 usage has significantly decreased in the last years; in particular web browsers now reject certificates signed with SHA-1. However, SHA-1 signatures are still supported in a large number of applications. SHA-1 is the default hash function used for certifying PGP keys in the legacy branch of GnuPG, and those signatures were accepted by the modern branch of GnuPG before we reported our results. Many non-web TLS clients also accept SHA-1 certificates, and SHA-1 is still allowed for in-protocol signatures in TLS and SSH. Even if actual usage is low (in the order of 1%), the fact that SHA-1 is allowed threatens the security because a meet-in-the-middle attacker will downgrade the connection to SHA-1. SHA-1 is also the foundation of the GIT versioning system. There are probably a lot of less known or proprietary protocols that still use SHA-1, but this is more difficult to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-affected&quot;&gt;What is affected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any usage where collision resistance is expected from SHA-1 is of course at high risk. We identified a few settings that are directly affected by chosen-prefix collisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PGP keys can be forged if third parties generate SHA-1 key certifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X.509 certificates could be broken if some Certificate Authorities issue SHA-1 certificates with predictable serial numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We note that classical collisions and chosen-prefix collisions do not threaten all usages of SHA-1. In particular, HMAC-SHA-1 seems relatively safe, and preimage resistance (aka ability to invert the hash function) of SHA-1 remains unbroken as of today. Yet, as cryptographers we recommend to deprecate SHA-1 everywhere, even when there is no direct evidence that this weaknesses can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-do&quot;&gt;What should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove any use of SHA-1 in your product as soon as possible and use instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf&quot;&gt;SHA-256&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf&quot;&gt;SHA-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHA-1 has been broken for 15 years, so there is no good reason to use this hash function in modern security software. Attacks only get better over time, and the goal of the cryptanalysis effort is to warn users so that they can deprecate algorithms before the attacks get practical. We actually expect our attack to cost just a couple thousand USD in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-does-the-attack-cost&quot;&gt;How much does the attack cost?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By renting a GPU cluster online, the entire chosen-prefix collision attack on SHA-1 costed us about 75k USD. However, at the time of conputation, our implementation was not optimal and we lost some time (because research). Besides, computation prices went further down since then, so we estimate that our attack costs today about 45k USD. As computation costs continue to decrease rapidly, we evaluate that it should cost less than 10k USD to generate a chosen-prefix collision attack on SHA-1 by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, a classical collision for SHA-1 now costs just about 11k USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wasnt-there-already-a-collision-attack-against-sha-1&quot;&gt;Wasn’t there already a collision attack against SHA-1?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classical collision has been computed for SHA-1 in late 2017, as you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://shattered.io/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is very different from a chosen-prefix collision, where any prefix pair can be challenged for the collision, which leads to a much more serious impact in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wasnt-there-already-a-chosen-prefix-collision-attack-against-sha-1&quot;&gt;Wasn’t there already a chosen-prefix collision attack against SHA-1?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we announced a new chosen-prefix collision attack, as you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/459&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/sha1-cp&quot;&gt;some test code&lt;/a&gt; is also available) and this work was published at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2019/&quot;&gt;Eurocrypt 2019&lt;/a&gt; conference. Here, we further improved these results up to a point where the attack becomes doable for a reasonable amount of money, and we wrote an actual implementation of the attack to compute the chosen-prefix collision against SHA-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-try-it-out-for-myself&quot;&gt;Can I try it out for myself?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our attack on SHA-1 has pratical implications, in order to make sure proper countermeasures have been pushed we will wait for some time before releasing source code that allows to generate SHA-1 chosen-prefix collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Jake Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 7, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The random-number generation facilities in the kernel have been reworked some over the past few months—but problems in that subsystem have been addressed over an &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Random_numbers&quot;&gt;even longer time frame&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/802360/&quot;&gt;most recent changes&lt;/a&gt; were made to stop the &lt;tt&gt;getrandom()&lt;/tt&gt; system call from blocking for long periods of time at system boot, but the underlying cause was the behavior of the blocking random pool. A recent patch set would remove that pool and it would seem to be headed for the mainline kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Lutomirski &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/cover.1577088521.git.luto@kernel.org/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; version 3 of the patch set toward the end of December. It makes &quot;&lt;span&gt;two major semantic changes to Linux's random APIs&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. It adds a new &lt;tt&gt;GRND_INSECURE&lt;/tt&gt; flag to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;getrandom()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; system call (though Lutomirski refers to it as &lt;tt&gt;getentropy()&lt;/tt&gt;, which is implemented in glibc using &lt;tt&gt;getrandom()&lt;/tt&gt; with fixed flags); that flag would cause the call to always return the amount data requested, but with no guarantee that the data is random. The kernel would just make its best effort to give the best random data it has at that point in time. &quot;&lt;span&gt;Calling it 'INSECURE' is probably the best we can do to discourage using this API for things that need security.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches also remove the blocking pool. The kernel currently maintains two pools of random data, one that corresponds to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt; and another for &lt;tt&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/tt&gt;, as described in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/658497/&quot;&gt;2015 article&lt;/a&gt;. The blocking pool is the one for &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt;; reads to that device will block (thus the name) until &quot;enough&quot; entropy has been gathered from the system to satisfy the request. Further reads from that file will also block if there is insufficient entropy in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the blocking pool means that reads from &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt; behave like &lt;tt&gt;getrandom()&lt;/tt&gt; with a &lt;tt&gt;flags&lt;/tt&gt; value of zero (and turns the &lt;tt&gt;GRND_RANDOM&lt;/tt&gt; flag into a noop). Once the cryptographic random-number generator (CRNG) has been initialized, reads from &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt; and calls to &lt;tt&gt;getrandom(..., 0)&lt;/tt&gt; will not block and will return the requested amount of random data. Lutomirski said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Linux's blocking pool has outlived its usefulness. Linux's CRNG generates output that is good enough to use even for key generation. The blocking pool is not stronger in any material way, and keeping it around requires a lot of infrastructure of dubious value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes were made with an eye toward ensuring that existing programs are not really affected; in fact, the problems with long waits for things like generating GnuPG keys will get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series should not break any existing programs. /dev/urandom is unchanged. /dev/random will still block just after booting, but it will block less than it used to. getentropy() with existing flags will return output that is, for practical purposes, just as strong as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutomirski noted that there is still the open question of whether the kernel should provide so-called &quot;true random numbers&quot;, which is, to a certain extent, what the blocking pool was meant to do. He can only see one reason to do so: &quot;&lt;span&gt;compliance with government standards&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. He suggested that if the kernel were to provide that, it should be done through an entirely different interface—or be punted to user space by providing a way for it to extract raw event samples that could be used to create such a blocking pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan Müller &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/9872655.prSdhymlXK@positron.chronox.de/&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that his Linux random-number generator (LRNG) &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2722222.P16TYeLAVu%40positron.chronox.de/&quot;&gt;patch set&lt;/a&gt; (now up to version 26) might be a way to provide true random numbers for applications that need them. The LRNG is &quot;&lt;span&gt;fully compliant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-90b/final&quot;&gt;SP800-90B&lt;/a&gt; requirements&lt;/span&gt;&quot; , which makes it a solution to the governmental-standards problem. Matthew Garrett &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20191226100334.bsh3b3dphs4j4cvx@srcf.ucam.org/&quot;&gt;objected&lt;/a&gt; to the term &quot;true random data&quot;, noting that the devices being sampled could, in principle, be modeled accurately enough to make them predictable: &quot;&lt;span&gt;We're not sampling quantum events here.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; Müller &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/8794771.pXx7ivobnm@tauon.chronox.de/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the term comes from the German AIS 31 standard to describe a random-number generator that only produces output &quot;&lt;span&gt;at an equal rate as the underlying noise source produces entropy&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the terminology, though, having a blocking pool as is proposed by the LRNG patches will just lead to various problems, at least if it is available without privilege, Lutomirski &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/888017FA-06A1-42EF-9FC0-46629138DA9E@amacapital.net/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;This doesn’t solve the problem. If two different users run stupid programs like gnupg, they will starve each other.
&lt;p&gt;As I see it, there are two major problems with /dev/random right now: it’s prone to DoS (i.e. starvation, malicious or otherwise), and, because no privilege is required, it’s prone to misuse. Gnupg is misuse, full stop. If we add a new unprivileged interface, gnupg and similar programs will use it, and we lose all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Müller &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/4820831.xlnk3tY4r2@tauon.chronox.de/&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of &lt;tt&gt;getrandom()&lt;/tt&gt; will now allow GnuPG to use that interface since it will provide the needed guarantee that the pool has been initialized. From discussions with GnuPG maintainer Werner Koch, Müller believes that guarantee is the only reason GnuPG currently reads directly from &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt;. But if there is an unprivileged interface that is subject to denial of service (like &lt;tt&gt;/dev/random&lt;/tt&gt; today), it will be misused by some applications, Lutomirski &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/E464D551-1631-4EA8-ADFB-852E16D29CA9@amacapital.net/&quot;&gt;asserted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theodore Y. Ts'o, who is the maintainer of the Linux random-number subsystem, appears to have changed his mind along the way about the need for a blocking pool. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20191226140423.GB3158@mit.edu/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that removing that pool would effectively get rid of the idea that Linux has a true random-number generator (TRNG), which &quot;&lt;span&gt;is not insane; this is what the *BSD's have always done&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. He, too, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20191227130436.GC70060@mit.edu/&quot;&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; that providing a TRNG mechanism will just serve as an attractant for application developers. He also thinks that it is not really possible to guarantee a TRNG in the kernel, given all of the different types of hardware supported by Linux. Even making the facility only available to root will not solve the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application programmers would give instructions requiring that their application be installed as root to be more secure, &quot;because that way you can get access the _really_ good random numbers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Müller &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/15817620.rmTN4T87Wr@tauon.chronox.de/&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if Ts'o was giving up on the blocking pool implementation that he had added long ago. Ts'o &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20191227220857.GD70060@mit.edu/&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that he was; he is planning to take the patches from Lutomirski and is pretty strongly opposed to adding a blocking interface back into the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel can't offer up any guarantees about whether or not the noise source has been appropriately characterized. All say, a GPG or OpenSSL developer can do is get the vague sense that TRUERANDOM is &quot;better&quot; and of course, they want the best security, so of *course* they are going to try to use it. At which point it will block, and when some other clever user (maybe a distro release engineer) puts it into an init script, then systems will stop working and users will complain to Linus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cryptographers and others who really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a TRNG, Ts'o is also in favor of providing them a way to collect their own entropy in user space to use as they see fit. Entropy collection is not something that the kernel can reliably do on all of the different hardware that it supports, nor can it estimate the amount of entropy provided by the different sources, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BigQuote&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;The kernel shouldn't be mixing various noise sources together, and it certainly shouldn't be trying to claim that it knows how many bits of entropy that it gets when [it] is trying to play some jitter entropy game on a stupid-simple CPU architecture for IOT/Embedded user cases where everything is synchronized off of a single master oscillator, and there is no CPU instruction reordering or register renaming, etc., etc.
&lt;p&gt;You can talk about providing tools that try to make these estimations --- but these sorts of things would have to be done on each user's hardware, and for most distro users, it's just not practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if it's just for cryptographers, then let it all be done in userspace, and let's not make it easy for GPG, OpenSSL, etc., to all say, &quot;We want TrueRandom(tm); we won't settle for less&quot;. We can talk about how do we provide the interfaces so that those cryptographers can get the information they need so they can get access to the raw noise sources, separated out and named, and with possibly some way that the noise source can authenticate itself to the Cryptographer's userspace library/application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of discussion about how that interface might look; there may be security implications for some of the events, for example. Ts'o &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20191229144904.GB7177@mit.edu/&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the keyboard scan codes (i.e. the keys pressed) are mixed into the pool as part of the entropy collection. &quot;&lt;span&gt;Exposing this to userspace, even if it is via a privileged system call, would be... unwise.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; It does seem possible that other event timings could provide some kind of side-channel information leak as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would seem that a longtime feature of the Linux random-number subsystem is on its way out. Given the changes that the random-number subsystem have undergone recently, it effectively was only causing denial-of-service problems when it was used; there are now better ways to get the best random numbers that the kernel can provide. If a TRNG is still desired for Linux, that lack will need to be addressed in the future, but likely will not be done within the kernel itself.&lt;/p&gt;
