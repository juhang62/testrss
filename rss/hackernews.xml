<title>The Decline of Usability</title>
<link>https://datagubbe.se/decusab/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://datagubbe.se/decusab/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In which we delve into the world of user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our premise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time (roughly between 1994 and 2012) when a reasonably computer-literate user could sit down in front of almost any operating system and quickly get to grips with the GUI, no matter what their home base was. Windows, MacOS, CDE, OpenStep, OS/2 and even outliers like Amiga, Atari and BeOS all had more in common than what set them apart. All windows had a title bar for dragging, easy identification and displaying current input focus. Clearly labeled drop-down menus following a set standard (File, Edit, View, Help etc.) made it easy for a newcomer to an application to browse program features and learn keyboard shortcuts. Buttons, input fields and other widget elements were clearly identifiable through various visual cues, such as 3D bevels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few rogue applications didn't play by the rules, but the vast majority of software did, at least in the fundamental places that really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it seems we're on another track completely. Despite being endlessly fawned over by an army of professionals, Usability, or as it used to be called, &quot;User Friendliness&quot;, is steadily declining. During the last ten years or so, adhering to basic standard concepts seems to have fallen out of fashion. On comparatively new platforms, I.E. smartphones, it's inevitable: the input mechanisms and interactions with the display are so different from desktop computers that new paradigms are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, these paradigms have begun spreading to the desktop, where keyboards for fast typing and pixel-precision mice effectively render them pointless. Coupled with the flat design trend, UI elements are increasingly growing both bigger and yet somehow harder to locate and tell apart from non-interactive decorations and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, designers of desktop applications seem to have abandoned the fact that a desktop computer is capable of displaying several applications and windows at the same time and that many users are accustomed to this. Instead, we're increasingly treated to small-screen, single-app paradigms copied from smartphones. That's a turn for the worse in its own right, but perhaps more troubling and annoying is the recurring sidestepping from the tried and true UI design that is so ingrained in many users it's practically muscle memory by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples to prove a point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Window Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these title bars of a few popular Windows 10 applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/windowtitles.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above is composed from screenshots taken on the same computer during the span of a few minutes. No settings have been changed between shots. Immediately, a plethora of UI problems become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you even tell how many windows there are? The answer is six - although the top three and bottom two could, when ending up stacked like this, look as if they're two single applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these title bars denote active windows. The top one, Outlook, looks exactly the same when inactive, as does Slack. Except for the command prompt (cmd.exe), the change between active and inactive on the remaining windows is so subtle that when aligned next to each other, it's virtually impossible to determine which one has the input focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the title bars contain some kind of UI widget. Some have little tool icons, some have tabs, some have drop-down menus, some have combinations thereof. There is no set behavior and, more importantly, the clickable area for traditional operations (move, focus, raise) on each title bar is now of variable width. If you're accustomed to a title bar being for handling the window and nothing else, it's very easy to misclick and activate an application feature you didn't intend to. Oh, and the little Visual Studio Code logo on the second title bar from the top? Nope, not an icon. Purely decorational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's perhaps most jarring about this is that four of the six applications are made by Microsoft themselves, thus setting the standard for this kind of erratic design. We can already see the effects: the taking over of window title bars seems to get worse with time. Consider the latest version of Slack (click for a larger image):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/slackhotspot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/slackhotspot.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Windows 2 (not 2000 - I'm really talking about Windows 2), users have been able to resize windows by dragging their top border and corners. Not so with Slack, anymore. The red lines in the image denote the remaining hotspots available for resizing. The blue lines denote the remaining hotspots available for moving the window. The rest is now taken up by a non-standard concoction of widgets that most users will either soon learn keyboard shortcuts for or that could very easily be incorporated into a more traditional UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, some usability whizkid at some point decided to completely nullify the single most fundamental way of managing the window of an application mostly running on platforms where stacking, floating window management is not only the norm but pretty much the only available option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Browsers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Slack aren't the only culprits. Google, for example, have gotten increasingly into some kind of A/B testing of late and their Chrome browser now features this type of tooltip when hovering on tabs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/hovertab.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, a browser tab will display a small, floating tooltip after having been hovered for a bit of time. This massive monstrosity pops up without delay and covers a large area of the underlying UI. The usefulness of browser tab tooltips can be discussed in itself, but this is no doubt both pointless and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google aren't the only ones capable of producing distracting UI:s, though. The newly released Firefox version 75 features what has become known as &quot;the megabar&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/megabar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new take on the URL bar pops up when you least expect it, is very hard to get rid of and, as a bonus, covers the tried, tested and highly usable bookmarks toolbar below it. Just like widgets in title bars, this breaks the behavior of a UI concept in such a major way it's hard to begin describing: text input fields are ubiquitous, ancient and their basic concept has been the same since at least the early 1980:s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scroll bars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blow against recognizability and usability is harder to take a screenshot of, namely auto-hiding scroll bars. On a smartphone, it's a great invention because you can free up real estate on a small display and you've usually got your thumb resting close to the screen, ready to do a test scroll in your full screen app to see if more content is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the desktop, however, a scroll bar is very useful for determining your current position in the content without having to break away from what you're presently doing and reach for the mouse. It's also useful for doing the same in windows that are currently not in focus. For example, in a tailing log file reader or command prompt with a debug stream, you might be interested in knowing if you're looking at the latest output or not. With auto-hiding scroll bars, this becomes much harder and you have to resort to other, often less apparent or more cumbersome methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of screenshots of hidden scroll bars, let's look at how QT5 renders them by default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/sbar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which part of this is the bar and which part is the tray? I know by now that the slightly brighter part is the bar, yet I frequently misclick, because the flat design makes them so hard to tell apart. Worse still is the infinitesimal contrast, so low that on older, cheaper laptop screens, it's downright impossible to tell the difference between bar and tray. New users probably don't know that with the right tools, QT5 can be configured to sport a more traditional look, so the default look should be geared towards them. Those intent on customizing the appearance of their personal desktop will usually find a way to do so anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Missing Menu Bars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another apparently unfashionable UI standard is the menu bar. It used to be a lowest common denominator between platforms and, when still present, it works basically the same on Windows, Mac and Unix-likes. For the most part, it even keeps the traditional &quot;File, Edit, View&quot; approach to things. The Gnome designers, however, have decided that such menus are apparently a bad feature and they should probably never have been used in the first place. To rectify more than three decades of such folly, they have created... something I'm not sure what to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tricks up their sleeve is the hamburger menu. On smartphones, it's a great feature, but on the desktop, it's unnecessary: If there's anything we have on today's wide screen displays, it's horizontal space. In Gnome, it seems to be a catch-all for UI operations that didn't end up somewhere else. Like in Evince:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/ev_menu3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open, Save, Print, Close. All of them reasonable tasks, except there's no adherence to standards. In Gnome-MPV, the hamburger menu looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/gmpv_menu3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Open or Close here, you silly user! What did you expect? Some kind of coherent thought? If you want to open a file, just click the little icon to the left featuring a plus sign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/gmpv_menu2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a button with the Gnome-MPV icon on it. One might assume this button would contain features specific to Gnome-MPV, such as the ones found the the hamburger menu, but no. Instead it looks like this, containing options for preferences and quitting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/gmpv_menu1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Evince, the button featuring an Evince icon produces this menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/ev_menu1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bummer! In Evince, you clearly have to look somewhere else to find in-app preferences and a quit option: things are wildly inconsistent between applications, creating confusion and frustration for users. I also can't find a way to navigate these menus using the keyboard once they're open, as opposed to normal drop-down menus and other similar hamburger menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Gnome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many more examples in just these two Gnome applications alone that it's bordering on parodical. For example, they are designed for Gnome's new paradigm of incorporating toolbars into the window title bar, thus institutionalizing the crimes of the Windows applications mentioned above. The difference is of course that if you're running another window manager, it just looks silly, for example leaving you with two close gadgets. It also means that to keep a reasonably large area free for moving the window (At least that's better than Slack!), widgets that could previously have been fitted into a toolbar below the title bar now needs to be opened separately, such as this search box in Evince (click for a larger image):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/ev_search.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/ev_search.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Or this little extra toolbar for making annotations, containing a whopping total of two icons. That's one whole icon more than is used to open the toolbar itself, clearly warranting this particular design approach:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/ev_extratoolbar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of crimes against basic concepts of desktop UI design. There are plenty more and they're present on all platforms. They are also, it seems, growing increasingly common: the times of coherency and industry standards seem to be over. I hope that with this little rant, I can plant a seed to bring them back. If not, it was at least good to blow off some steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to end by discussing some counter arguments I've come across when discussing modern UI design on various online forums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology is progressing! You can't stop change! Just deal with it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These and similar truisms and platitudes are commonly used when no real argument is available. It's people like you and me who decide to change UI design, not an unstoppable force of nature. Changing things doesn't necessarily imply improving them and it's improvement we should strive for, otherwise change is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're living in the past!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering the apparent anachronisms in the above screenshots, I can't argue with the fact that I am. However, that doesn't automatically mean I'm wrong. It also doesn't mean I think all modern desktop environments should look like Windows 95 or CDE. There are other roads forward and other ways to improve the look and feel of UI:s without breaking fundamental concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electron apps can't follow a single platform's standard!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-platform applications will of course never fully incorporate into the host enviroment the way native ones do. But because of this, it's of extra importance that they at least adhere to the paradigms that are translatable between all the common target platforms of today. Drop-down menus, clean title bars and a clear indication of window focus aren't hard to implement, even if they don't look exactly like their surroundings. In fact, a multi-platform framework should make it easy for developers to implement these concepts and hard, if not impossible, to work around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We shouldn't complain about free software! It's free!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. Yes we should. Don't get me wrong - I have a massive amount of respect and admiration for the time, skill and effort people put into FOSS projects. They are improving my personal quality of life significantly and for that I'm very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that Gnome and KDE are FOSS, which is a thing of wonder. But they are also large enough to, just like Microsoft and Google, have a significant impact not only on normal end users but on aspiring designers and programmers as well. We should be able to share our views and discuss what that impact might result in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: Anyone setting an example should also be held to a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting things in the title bar saves screen real estate!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is true to some extent, but screen real estate in general isn't much of a problem anymore. If this had been done in the days of 640x480 VGA, it could maybe have been a viable argument. Today, anyone working enough with computers to worry about a few pixels extra can buy a screen the size of a small TV with a 2560x1440 pixel resolution for around US$200. Even the cheapest of laptops come with at least a 1366x768 resolution, which is en par with the famed megapixel displays of yesteryear's professional workstations, coveted precisely for their generous amount of screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, the problem with screen real estate comes from the current trend of UI design with so much white space between elements that what used to be a simple requester is now a full-screen application, as evident in this example (click for larger image):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/winpara2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datagubbe.se/decusab/winpara2.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those spending all their workdays coding on a 13&quot; laptop, my tip is to stop worrying about screen real estate and start worrying about your back, neck, hands and shoulders a bit more. Trust me, RSI is a serious thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing UI:s is hard and application software can't please everyone all the time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is true and, as a software developer of more than 20 years, I have a huge amount of respect for the complexity of UI design. I also happen to know that such complexity is not a valid excuse for willingly and knowingly breaking UI concepts that have been proven and working for, in some cases, more than four decades. In fact, a lot of the examples above introduce more complexity for the user to cope with. The intricacies of each application and window decoration must be learned separately and time and energy is spent by repeatedly parsing the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Apple?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't comment on the current state of MacOS since the time I've spent actually using a Mac during the last 8 years or so probably totals to a few hours. Apple used to be good at this, and I hear they still do a decent job at keeping things sane, even post-Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're old and angry!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You bet! Now get off my lawn, punk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade in the making, NASA and SpaceX have set May 27 as the target launch date for the first crewed space mission to launch into orbit from U.S. soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, two veterans of the shuttle program, will ride SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft into orbit on top of a Falcon 9 rocket from pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. That’s the same historic launch facility used by the last space shuttle flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liftoff time on May 27 is expected to be around 4:32 p.m. EDT (2032 GMT), when the Earth’s rotation brings the launch pad under the orbital plane of the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things,” NASA said in an update Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon will fire its Draco thrusters to rendezvous and dock with the space station the day after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary,” NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a launch May 27, Crew Dragon will dock with the space station at 11:29 a.m. EDT (1529 GMT) on May 28, NASA says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;BREAKING: On May 27, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@NASA&lt;/a&gt; will once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil! With our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpaceX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; partners, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Astro_Doug?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Astro_Doug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AstroBehnken?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@AstroBehnken&lt;/a&gt; will launch to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Space_Station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CrewDragon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CrewDragon&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurley and Behnken are training for the test flight, designated Demo-2, and are expected to live and work on the space station for several months. They will undock and return to Earth for a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Demo-2 flight with astronauts caps a decade-long effort to design, develop and qualify the Crew Dragon spacecraft for piloted missions. SpaceX successfully flew a Crew Dragon capsule without astronauts to the space station in March 2019 and returned the ship to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has also completed two major tests of the Crew Dragon’s launch escape system, which would be used to push the capsule away from its Falcon 9 rocket during fueling on the launch pad, or in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/13/bridenstine-says-crew-dragon-could-launch-with-astronauts-at-end-of-may/&quot;&gt;said he was “fairly confident”&lt;/a&gt; the Crew Dragon could be ready to carry astronauts to the space station at the end of May or in early June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Spaceflight Now last week, Bridenstine cited several focus areas as SpaceX and NASA march toward launch of the Demo-2 test flight. They included completing two final parachute tests, data reviews, and ensuring the astronauts and ground teams remain healthy during the global coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two remaining parachute tests was successfully completed last weekend after dropping a test rig from a C-130 cargo plane. SpaceX changed the testing plan after a helicopter drop test in March was cut short when the test rig became unstable, forcing the pilot to prematurely release the device that simulates the mass of the Crew Dragon spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was not related to the parachutes themselves, and chute testing have successfully resumed, NASA officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more parachute drop test from the C-130 cargo plane is scheduled for early May. That will be the final planned parachute test before the Demo-2 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, SpaceX said it has completed 26 tests of the Crew Dragon’s “Mark 3” parachute design, including 13 single parachute tests, 12 multi-chute drops, and an integrated test of the entire parachute recovery system on the Crew Dragon’s in-flight launch abort test in January.&lt;/p&gt;

The Falcon 9 rocket that will launch the Demo-2 mission is emblazoned with NASA’s “worm” logo, which was retired from official use in 1992. “The retro, modern design of the agency’s logo will help capture the excitement of a new, modern era of human spaceflight on the side of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the International Space Station as part of the Demo-2 flight,” NASA said. The iconic blue NASA meatball logo will remain the agency’s primary symbol. Credit: SpaceX
&lt;p&gt;An investigation into an engine failure on the most recent launch of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket — the same design that will launch the Crew Dragon astronauts — was also expected to be completed in short order, Bridenstine said last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re really good shape,” Bridenstine told Spaceflight Now last week. “I’m fairly confident that we can launch at the end of May. If we do slip, it’ll probably be into June. It won’t be much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations for the Demo-2 launch are continuing during the coronavirus pandemic. NASA has determined the crewed mission is essential, and the astronauts, their training teams and SpaceX’s spacecraft and rocket technicians remain at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other officials, such as managers and some engineers, are working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX and Boeing won multibillion-dollar NASA commercial crew contracts to develop human-rated spaceships in 2014, following several years of preliminary development and testing. SpaceX is ahead of Boeing, and the crew capsule for the upcoming test flight — designated Demo-2 — is currently at Cape Canaveral undergoing pre-launch processing and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, NASA is paying SpaceX more than $3.1 billion for Crew Dragon development and six operational crew rotation flights to the space station following the Demo-2 mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s Starliner capsule will give NASA a U.S.-built ship to ferry crews to and from the station, ending the space agency’s reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for crew transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is set to be the first commercial company to launch astronauts into orbit after Boeing ran into trouble on the first unpiloted test flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule in December.&lt;/p&gt;

NASA astronauts Doug Hurley (foreground) and Bob Behnken (background) participated in a two-day flight simulation in March. The astronauts are inside a SpaceX flight simulator in this photo. Credit: SpaceX
&lt;p&gt;Behnken, 49, will be the “joint operations commander” for the Demo-2 mission, responsible for activities such as rendezvous, docking and undocking, according to NASA. He will also be responsible for mission activities while at the space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurley, 53, will be the “spacecraft commander,” responsible for launch, landing and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were selected to join NASA’s astronaut corps in 2000, and they have each flown on two space shuttle flights. Hurley was the pilot of the space shuttle Atlantis on the shuttle program’s final mission in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Hurley and Behnken have been training for an extended stay on the space station. The Demo-2 mission was originally slated to last just a couple of weeks, with the crew’s focus on testing the Crew Dragon spacecraft before future station crews ride it to and from the space station on operational flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurley has been training to operate the space station’s Canadian-built robotic arm. Behnken has been practicing spacewalk procedures in case he is needed to go outside the station for repairs or maintenance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to keep our focus on the technical matters, the operational matters, and we’re trying to get the vehicle ready to go so that when we fly it, everything goes the way it’s supposed to,” Hurley told reporters in January. “The critical part is certifying the (Crew Dragon) vehicle for future crews… making it a great vehicle for those guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be ready when they pick the date,” Behnken said. “All the things that have to be ready, we’re just part of those things and we’ll just try really hard not to be the long pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Crew Dragon mission will be automated, but the astronauts will have the ability to command a manual launch abort with a handle on the ship’s cockpit control console. They also have the ability to manually fly the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our plan is to do some manual flying, in what we call the far-field,” Hurley said in January. “And then closer to ISS, the normal plan is to do an automated docking. Ideally, it would be nice to test that capability, but I think we can get some really good data from flying a little farther away on the docking axis with the vehicle. That is at least the plan going in, and there are some constraints with fuel and those kind of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridenstine said last week that the second Crew Dragon mission with astronauts, which will fly with a four-person crew, could launch in August or September, pending the outcome of the Demo-2 mission. On regular crew rotation flights, the Crew Dragon will be certified to remain docked at the space station as a lifeboat and return vehicle for up to 210 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon spacecraft flying on the Demo-2 mission will be able to stay at the space station for about 110 days, according to NASA. The exact duration of Hurley and Behnken’s mission will be determined based on the readiness of the next commercial crew launch, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the next Crew Dragon is ready for launch in August or September, Bridenstine said the Demo-2 mission will last around two or three months.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is BGP Safe Yet?</title>
<link>https://isbgpsafeyet.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://isbgpsafeyet.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-bgp-hijack&quot;&gt;What’s a BGP hijack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand why BGP’s lack of security is so problematic, let’s look at a simplified model of how BGP is used to route Internet packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is not run by just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; company. It’s made up of thousands of autonomous systems with nodes located all around the world, connected to each other in a massive graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the way BGP works is that each node must determine how to route packets using only what it knows from &lt;strong&gt;the nodes it connects with directly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the simple network A–B–C–D–E, the node A only knows how to reach E based on information it received from B. The node B knows about the network from A and C. And so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;BGP hijack&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when a malicious node deceives another node, lying about what the routes are for its neighbors. Without any security protocols, this misinformation can propagate from node to node, until a large number of nodes now know about, and attempt to use these incorrect, nonexistent, or malicious routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click “&lt;strong&gt;Hijack the request&lt;/strong&gt;” to visualize how packets are re-routed:&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Is BGP safe yet? · Cloudflare</og:title>
<og:description>On the Internet, network devices exchange routes via a protocol called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Unfortunately, issues with BGP have led to malicious actors being able to hijack and misconfigure devices leading to security problems which have the potential to cause widespread problems. BGP security can be greatly improved by using technologies such as RPKI to sign Internet routes. This page attempts to track the progress of major Internet players (ISPs, transit operators, and content providers) in their progress to adopt RPKI and other technologies.</og:description>

&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Requirement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required python (version 2.7) libraries: Tensorflow (&amp;gt;=1.1) + Scipy + Numpy + Rawpy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested in Ubuntu + Intel i7 CPU + Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) with Cuda (&amp;gt;=8.0) and CuDNN (&amp;gt;=5.0). CPU mode should also work with minor changes but not tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dataset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Aug, 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; We found some misalignment with the ground-truth for image 10034, 10045, 10172. Please remove those images for quantitative results, but they still can be used for qualitative evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download it directly from Google drive for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/isl-datasets/SID/Sony.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; (25 GB) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/isl-datasets/SID/Fuji.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fuji&lt;/a&gt; (52 GB) sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is download limit by Google drive in a fixed period of time. If you cannot download because of this, try these links: &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G6VruemZtpOyHjOC5N8Ww3ftVXOydSXx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; (25 GB) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C7GeZ3Y23k1B8reRL79SqnZbRBc4uizH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fuji&lt;/a&gt; (52 GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New: we provide file parts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fk8EibhBe_M1qG0ax9LQZA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Baidu Drive&lt;/a&gt; now. After you download all the parts, you can combine them together by running: &quot;cat SonyPart* &amp;gt; Sony.zip&quot; and &quot;cat FujiPart* &amp;gt; Fuji.zip&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file lists are provided. In each row, there are a short-exposed image path, the corresponding long-exposed image path, camera ISO and F number. Note that multiple short-exposed images may correspond to the same long-exposed image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file name contains the image information. For example, in &quot;10019_00_0.033s.RAF&quot;, the first digit &quot;1&quot; means it is from the test set (&quot;0&quot; for training set and &quot;2&quot; for validation set); &quot;0019&quot; is the image ID; the following &quot;00&quot; is the number in the sequence/burst; &quot;0.033s&quot; is the exposure time 1/30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clone this repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the pretrained models by running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python download_models.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run &quot;python test_Sony.py&quot;. This will generate results on the Sony test set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &quot;python test_Fuji.py&quot;. This will generate results on the Fuji test set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, the code takes the data in the &quot;./dataset/Sony/&quot; folder and &quot;./dataset/Fuji/&quot;. If you save the dataset in other folders, please change the &quot;input_dir&quot; and &quot;gt_dir&quot; at the beginning of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Training new models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To train the Sony model, run &quot;python train_Sony.py&quot;. The result and model will be save in &quot;result_Sony&quot; folder by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To train the Fuji model, run &quot;python train_Fuji.py&quot;. The result and model will be save in &quot;result_Fuji&quot; folder by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, the code takes the data in the &quot;./dataset/Sony/&quot; folder and &quot;./dataset/Fuji/&quot;. If you save the dataset in other folders, please change the &quot;input_dir&quot; and &quot;gt_dir&quot; at the beginning of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading the raw data and proccesing by Rawpy takes significant more time than the backpropagation. By default, the code will load all the groundtruth data processed by Rawpy into memory without 8-bit or 16-bit quantization. This requires at least 64 GB RAM for training the Sony model and 128 GB RAM for the Fuji model. If you need to train it on a machine with less RAM, you may need to revise the code and use the groundtruth data on the disk. We provide the 16-bit groundtruth images processed by Rawpy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfkWVkauAsGvXtDJWX0IFDuDl5ozz2PM/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; (12 GB) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJM0xYVnzmOZNacBRKebiXA4mBmiTjte/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fuji&lt;/a&gt; (22 GB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I test my own data using the provided model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed method is designed for sensor raw data. The pretrained model probably not work for data from another camera sensor. We do not have support for other camera data. It also does not work for images after camera ISP, i.e., the JPG or PNG data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will this be in any product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a research project and a prototype to prove a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can I train the model using my own raw data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, you just need to subtract the right black level and pack the data in the same way of Sony/Fuji data. If using rawpy, you need to read the black level instead of using 512 in the provided code. The data range may also differ if it is not 14 bits. You need to normalize it to [0,1] for the network input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why the results are all black?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often because the pre-trained model not downloaded properly. After downloading, you should get 4 checkpoint related files for the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Building an end-to-end Speech Recognition model in PyTorch</title>
<link>https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has changed the game in speech recognition with the introduction of end-to-end models. These models take in audio, and directly output transcriptions. Two of the most popular end-to-end models today are Deep Speech by Baidu, and Listen Attend Spell (LAS) by Google. Both Deep Speech and LAS, are recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures with different approaches to modeling speech recognition. Deep Speech uses the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to predict the speech transcript. LAS uses a sequence to sequence network architecture for its predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These models simplified speech recognition pipelines by taking advantage of the capacity of deep learning system to learn from large datasets. With enough data, you should, in theory, be able to build a super robust speech recognition model that can account for all the nuance in speech without having to spend a ton of time and effort hand engineering acoustic features or dealing with complex pipelines in more old-school GMM-HMM model architectures, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a fast-moving field, and Deep Speech and LAS style architectures are already quickly becoming outdated. You can read about where the industry is moving in the Latest Advancement Section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;How to Build Your Own End-to-End Speech Recognition Model in PyTorch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's walk through how one would build their own end-to-end speech recognition model in PyTorch. The model we'll build is inspired by Deep Speech 2 (Baidu's second revision of their now-famous model) with some personal improvements to the architecture. The output of the model will be a probability matrix of characters, and we'll use that probability matrix to decode the most likely characters spoken from the audio. You can find the full code and also run the it with GPU support on &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IPpwx4rX32rqHKpLz7dc8sOKspUa-YKO&quot;&gt;Google Colaboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing the data pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is one of the most important aspects of speech recognition. We'll take raw audio waves and transform them into Mel Spectrograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/QcgsJsmohaMtFRIw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more on the details about how that transformation looks from this excellent post &lt;a href=&quot;https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For this post, you can just think of a Mel Spectrogram as essentially a picture of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/fOPEodLdOFtLHegW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the handling of audio data, we are going to use an extremely useful utility called &lt;code&gt;torchaudio&lt;/code&gt; which is a library built by the PyTorch team specifically for audio data. We'll be training on a subset of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openslr.org/12/&quot;&gt;LibriSpeech&lt;/a&gt;, which is a corpus of read English speech data derived from audiobooks, comprised of 100 hours of transcribed audio data. You can easily download this dataset using &lt;code&gt;torchaudio&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;import torchaudio

train_dataset = torchaudio.datasets.LIBRISPEECH(&quot;./&quot;, url=&quot;train-clean-100&quot;, download=True)
test_dataset = torchaudio.datasets.LIBRISPEECH(&quot;./&quot;, url=&quot;test-clean&quot;, download=True)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each sample of the dataset contains the waveform, sample rate of audio, the utterance/label, and more metadata on the sample. You can view what each sample looks like from the source code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/master/torchaudio/datasets/librispeech.py#L40&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Augmentation - SpecAugment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the diversity of your dataset in order to increase your dataset size. This strategy is especially helpful when data is scarce or if your model is overfitting. For speech recognition, you can do the standard augmentation techniques, like changing the pitch, speed, injecting noise, and adding reverb to your audio data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found Spectrogram Augmentation (SpecAugment), to be a much simpler and more effective approach. SpecAugment, was first introduced in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779&quot;&gt;SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition&lt;/a&gt;, in which the authors found that simply cutting out random blocks of consecutive time and frequency dimensions improved the models generalization abilities significantly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/YbqKqNBodFSQAVWD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PyTorch, you can use the &lt;code&gt;torchaudio&lt;/code&gt; function &lt;code&gt;FrequencyMasking&lt;/code&gt; to mask out the frequency dimension, and &lt;code&gt;TimeMasking&lt;/code&gt; for the time dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;torchaudio.transforms.FrequencyMasking()
torchaudio.transforms.TimeMasking()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the data, we'll need to transform the audio into Mel Spectrograms, and map the character labels for each audio sample into integer labels:&lt;/p&gt;

    return spectrograms, labels, input_lengths, label_lengths&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the Model - Deep Speech 2 (but better)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model will be similar to the Deep Speech 2 architecture. The model will have two main neural network modules - N layers of Residual Convolutional Neural Networks (ResCNN) to learn the relevant audio features, and a set of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNN) to leverage the learned ResCNN audio features. The model is topped off with a fully connected layer used to classify characters per time step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/BHOBfDVTcGCQKTtp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are great at extracting abstract features, and we'll apply the same feature extraction power to audio spectrograms. Instead of just vanilla CNN layers, we choose to use Residual CNN layers. Residual connections (AKA skip connections) were first introduced in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385&quot;&gt;Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition&lt;/a&gt;, where the author found that you can build really deep networks with good accuracy gains if you add these connections to your CNN's. Adding these Residual connections also helps the model learn faster and generalize better. The paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913&quot;&gt;Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets&lt;/a&gt; shows that networks with residual connections have a “flatter” loss surface, making it easier for models navigate the loss landscape and find a lower and more generalizable minima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/qbBytawOwsmKfYlI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are naturally great at sequence modeling problems. RNN's processes the audio features step by step, making a prediction for each frame while using context from previous frames. We use BiRNN's because we want the context of not only the frame before each step, but the frames after it as well. This can help the model make better predictions, as each frame in the audio will have more information before making a prediction. We chose to use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU's) variant of RNN's as it needs less computational resources than LSTM's, and works just as well in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model outputs a probability matrix for characters which we'll use to feed into our decoder to extract what the model believes is the highest probability characters that were spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;Picking the Right Optimizer and Scheduler - AdamW with Super Convergence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimizer and learning rate schedule plays a very important role in getting our model to converge to the best point. Picking the right optimizer and scheduler can also save you compute time, and help your model generalize better to real-world use cases. For our model, we'll be using &lt;strong&gt;AdamW&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;One Cycle Learning Rate Scheduler&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Adam&lt;/strong&gt; is a widely used optimizer that helps your model converge quicker, therefore, saving compute time, but has been notorious for not generalizing as well as &lt;strong&gt;Stochastic Gradient Descent&lt;/strong&gt; AKA &lt;strong&gt;SGD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdamW&lt;/strong&gt; was first introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101&quot;&gt;Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered a “fix” to &lt;strong&gt;Adam&lt;/strong&gt;. The paper pointed out that the original &lt;strong&gt;Adam&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm has a wrong implementation of weight decay, which &lt;strong&gt;AdamW&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to fix. This fix helps with &lt;strong&gt;Adam&lt;/strong&gt;'s generalization problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;One Cycle Learning Rate Scheduler&lt;/strong&gt; was first introduced in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120&quot;&gt;Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates&lt;/a&gt;. This paper shows that you can train neural networks an order of magnitude faster, while keeping their generalizable abilities, using a simple trick. You start with a low learning rate, which warms up to a large maximum learning rate, then decays linearly to the same point of where you originally started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/XhVKIzvgauDALinA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the maximum learning rate is magnitudes higher than the lowest, you also gain some regularization benefits which helps your model generalize better if you have a smaller set of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PyTorch, these two methods are already part of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), hparams['learning_rate'])
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(optimizer,
        max_lr=hparams['learning_rate'],
        steps_per_epoch=int(len(train_loader)),
        epochs=hparams['epochs'],
        anneal_strategy='linear')&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;The CTC Loss Function - Aligning Audio to Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model will be trained to predict the probability distribution of all characters in the alphabet for each frame (ie, timestep) in the spectrogram we feed into the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/mQEJyPYmfQAHalLK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.1034482758621&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image taking from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;distill.pub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional speech recognition models would require you to align the transcript text to the audio before training, and the model would be trained to predict specific labels at specific frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation of the CTC loss function is that it allows us to skip this step. Our model will learn to align the transcript itself during training. Key to this is the “blank” label introduced by CTC, which gives the model the ability to say that a certain audio frame did not produce a character. You can see a more detail explanation of CTC and how it works from &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/&quot;&gt;this excellent post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC loss function is built into PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;criterion = nn.CTCLoss(blank=28).to(device)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;Evaluating Your Speech Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Evaluating your speech recognition model, the industry standard is using the Word Error Rate (WER) as the metric. The Word Error Rate does exactly what it says - it takes the transcription your model outputs, and the true transcription, and measures the error between them. You can see how that's implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IPpwx4rX32rqHKpLz7dc8sOKspUa-YKO&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Another useful metric is also called the Character Error Rate (CER). The CER measures the error of the characters between the model's output and the true labels. These metrics are helpful to measure how well your model performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, we'll use a &quot;greedy&quot; decoding method to process our model's output into characters that can be combined to create the transcript. A &quot;greedy&quot; decoder takes in the model output, which is a softmax probability matrix of characters, and for each time step (spectrogram frame), it chooses the label with the highest probability. If the label is a blank label, we remove it from the final transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def GreedyDecoder(output, labels, label_lengths, blank_label=28, collapse_repeated=True):
    arg_maxes = torch.argmax(output, dim=2)
    decodes = []
    targets = []
    for i, args in enumerate(arg_maxes):
        decode = []
        targets.append(text_transform.int_to_text(labels[i][:label_lengths[i]].tolist()))
        for j, index in enumerate(args):
            if index != blank_label:
                if collapse_repeated and j != 0 and index == args[j -1]:
                    continue
                decode.append(index.item())
        decodes.append(text_transform.int_to_text(decode))
    return decodes, targets&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;Training and Monitoring Your Experiments Using Comet.ml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comet.ml/site/&quot;&gt;Comet.ml&lt;/a&gt; provides a platform that allows deep learning researchers to track, compare, explain, and optimize their experiments and models. Comet.ml has improved our productivity at AssemblyAI and we highly recommend using this platform for teams doing any sort of data science experiments. Comet.ml is super easy to set up. And works with just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# initialize experiment opbject
experiment = Experiment(api_key=comet_api_key, project_name=project_name)
experiment.set_name(exp_name)

# track metrics
experiment.log_metric('loss', loss.item())&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comet.ml provides you with a very productive dashboard where you can view and track your model's progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/XIvxIXiIbFxgsPCy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Comet to track metrics, code, hyper parameters, your model's graphs, among many other things! A really handy feature that Comet provides is the ability to compare your experiment among many other experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://landen.imgix.net/blog_KKMFzSYvUskeYQpX/assets/mdwMVAypIpIDBFJg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comet has a rich feature set that we won't cover all here, but we highly recommended using it for a productivity and sanity boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; function trains the model on a full epoch of data. The &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; function evaluates the model on test data after every epoch. It gets the &lt;code&gt;test_loss&lt;/code&gt; as well as the &lt;code&gt;cer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wer&lt;/code&gt; of the model. You can start running the training script right now with GPU support in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IPpwx4rX32rqHKpLz7dc8sOKspUa-YKO&quot;&gt;Google Colaboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;How to Improve Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech Recognition Requires a ton of data and a ton of compute resources. The example laid out is trained on a subset of LibriSpeech (100 hours of audio) and a single GPU. To get state of the art results you'll need to do distributed training on thousands of hours of data, on tens of GPU's spread out across many machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to get a big accuracy improvement is to decode the CTC probability matrix using a Language Model and the CTC beam search algorithm. CTC type models are very dependent on this decoding process to get good results. Luckily there is a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode&quot;&gt;open source library&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was made to be more accessible so it's a relatively smaller model (23 million Parameters) compared to something like BERT (340 million Parameters). It seems to be the larger you can get your network, the better it performs, although there are diminishing returns. A larger model equating to better performance is not always the case though, as proven by OpenAI's research &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/assets/deep-double-descent/&quot;&gt;Deep Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model has 3 residual CNN layers and 5 Bidirectional GRU layers which should allow you to train a reasonable batch size on a single GPU with at least 11GB of memory. You can tweak some of the hyper parameters in the main function to reduce or increase the model size for your use case and compute availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;color-1&quot;&gt;Latest Advancements In Speech Recognition with Deep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a fast-moving field. It seems like you can't go by a week without some new technique getting state of the art results. Here are a few of things worth exploring int the world of speech recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformers have taken the Natural Language Processing world by storm! First Introduced in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762&quot;&gt;Attention Is All You Need&lt;/a&gt;, transformers have been taking and modified to beat pretty much all existing NLP task dethroning RNN's type architectures. The Transformer's ability to see the full context of sequence data is transferable to speech as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Pre-training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow deep learning closely you've probably heard of BERT, GPT, and GPT2. These Transformer models have first pertained on a language modeling task with unlabeled text data, and fine-tuned on a wide array of NLP task and get state of the art results! During pre-training, the model learns something fundamental on the statistics of language and uses that power to excel at other tasks. We believe this technique has great promises on speech data as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Piece Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model defined above output characters. Some benefits to that are the model doesn't have to worry about out of vocabulary words when running inference on speech. So for the word &lt;code&gt;c h a t&lt;/code&gt; each character has is its own label. The downside to using characters are inefficiency and the model being prone to more errors because you're predicting one character at a time. Using the whole word as labels have been explored, to some degree of success. Using this method, the entire word &lt;code&gt;chat&lt;/code&gt; would be the label. But using whole words, you would have to keep an index of all possible vocabularies to make a prediction, which is memory inefficient with the possibility of running into out of vocabulary words during prediction. The sweet spot would be using word piece or sub-word units as labels. Instead of characters for the individual label, you can chop up the words into sub-word units, and use those as labels, i.e. &lt;code&gt;ch at&lt;/code&gt;. This solves the out of vocabulary issue, and is much more efficient, as it needs fewer steps to decode then using characters, and without the need to have an index of all possible words. Word pieces have been used successfully with many NLP models, like BERT and would work naturall with speech recognition problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: A basketball hoop to maximize shots that go in [video]</title>
<link>https://youtu.be/vtN4tkvcBMA</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://youtu.be/vtN4tkvcBMA</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I've wondered if it is possible to make a basketball hoop where the ball always goes in. Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often. In this video I show how I wrote a program to calculate the optical backboard then machined and fabricated it. It worked out better than I was expected so I'm really happy with it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've gotten a lot of questions about my iPad setup. I'm using the &quot;concepts&quot; app. It is a pheromonal way to explore ideas since you have an infinite canvas + good zoom + colors + undo. For some of my projects the virtual paper is the size of a dinner table with ideas that branch out in all directions. Also a lot easier to store &amp;amp; share than paper. I highly recommend it if you do a lot of brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've also gotten a lot of requests for the code. At the moment I'd categorize the code as a crime against humanity and I am too ashamed to open source it. I want to revisit this project and improve the performance in the lower corners. If I do that I'll clean up the code and share it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;duh-dun&quot; sound from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orangefreesounds.com%2Flaw-and-order-sound%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=iTrUbQotkjFfcIt9CTkcgeKsxjR8MTU4NzI1ODA5NEAxNTg3MTcxNjk0&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=vtN4tkvcBMA&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orangefreesounds.com%2Flaw-and-order-sound%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=iTrUbQotkjFfcIt9CTkcgeKsxjR8MTU4NzI1ODA5NEAxNTg3MTcxNjk0&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=vtN4tkvcBMA&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CCQQ6TgYACITCM2Koqjj8OgCFcFBTAgdl9oNXkjAifDe5Jbe6b4B&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.orangefreesounds.com/law-a...&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%2F4.0%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=iTrUbQotkjFfcIt9CTkcgeKsxjR8MTU4NzI1ODA5NEAxNTg3MTcxNjk0&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=vtN4tkvcBMA&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%2F4.0%2F&amp;amp;redir_token=iTrUbQotkjFfcIt9CTkcgeKsxjR8MTU4NzI1ODA5NEAxNTg3MTcxNjk0&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=vtN4tkvcBMA&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CCQQ6TgYACITCM2Koqjj8OgCFcFBTAgdl9oNXkjAifDe5Jbe6b4B&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
