<title>A small notebook for a system administrator</title>
<link>https://habr.com/en/post/437912/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://habr.com/en/post/437912/</guid>
<description>I am a system administrator, and I need a small, lightweight notebook for every day carrying. Of course, not just to carry it, but for use it to work.&lt;p&gt;I already have a ThinkPad x200, but it’s heavier than I would like. And among the lightweight notebooks, I did not find anything suitable. All of them imitate the MacBook Air: thin, shiny, glamorous, and they all critically lack ports. Such notebook is suitable for posting photos on Instagram, but not for work. At least not for mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After not finding anything suitable, I thought about how a notebook would turn out if it were developed not with design, but the needs of real users in mind. System administrators, for example. Or people serving telecommunications equipment in hard-to-reach places — on roofs, masts, in the woods, literally in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of my thoughts are presented in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/m6/d3/mrm6d3szvghhpghfchsl_-lzgb4.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/_1/mp/vl/_1mpvlyujldpnad0cvvzvbci50y.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure to attract attention&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, your understanding of the admin notebook does not have to coincide with mine. But I hope you will find a couple of interesting thoughts here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind that «system administrator» is just the name of my position. And in fact, I have to work as a network engineer, and installer, and perform a significant part of other work related to hardware. Our company is tiny, we are far from large settlements, so all of us have to be universal specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order not to constantly clarify «this notebook», later in the article I will call it the “adminbook”. Although it can be useful not only to administrators, but also to all who need a small, lightweight notebook with a lot of connectors. In fact, even large laptops don’t have as many connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's get started…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Dimensions and weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, you want it smaller and more lightweight, but the keyboard with the screen should not be too small. And there has to be space for connectors, too.&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, a suitable option is a notebook half the size of an x200. That is, approximately the size of a sheet of A5 paper (210x148mm). In addition, the side pockets of many bags and backpacks are designed for this size. This means that the adminbook doesn’t even have to be carried in the main compartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I couldn’t fit everything I wanted into 210mm. To make a comfortable keyboard, the width had to be increased to 230mm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the illustrations the adminbook may seem too thick. But that’s only an optical illusion. In fact, its thickness is 25mm (28mm taking the rubber feet into account).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its size is close to the usual hardcover book, 300-350 pages thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s lightweight, too — about 800 grams (half the weight of the ThinkPad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case of the adminbook is made of &lt;s&gt;mithril&lt;/s&gt; aluminum. It’s a lightweight, durable metal with good thermal conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Keyboard and trackpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;A quality keyboard is very important for me. “Quality” there means the fastest possible typing and hotkey speed. It needs to be so “matter-of-fact” I don’t have to think about it at all, as if it types seemingly by force of thought.&lt;p&gt;This is possible if the keys are normal size and in their typical positions. But the adminbook is too small for that. In width, it is even smaller than the main block of keys of a desktop keyboard. So, you have to work around that somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long search and numerous tests, I came up with what you see in the picture:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/2-/mh/ag/2-mhagvoofl7vgqiadv3rcnclb0.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/2-/mh/ag/2-mhagvoofl7vgqiadv3rcnclb0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adminbook keyboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.2.1 — Adminbook keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This keyboard has the same vertical key distance as on a regular keyboard. A horizontal distance decreased just only 2mm (17 instead of 19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can even type blindly on this keyboard! To do this, some keys have small bumps for tactile orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you do not sit at a table, the main input method will be to press the keys “at a glance”. And here the muscle memory does not help — you have to look at the keys with your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hit the buttons faster, different key colors are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the numeric row is specifically colored gray to visually separate it from the QWERTY row, and NumLock is mapped to the “6” key, colored black to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the right of NumLock, gray indicates the area of the numeric keypad. These (and neighboring) buttons work like a numeric keypad in NumLock mode or when you press Fn. I must say, this is a useful feature for the admin computer — some users come up with passwords on the numpad in the form of a “cross”, “snake”, “spiral”, etc. I want to be able to type them that way too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the function keys. I don’t know about you, but it annoys me when, in a 15-inch laptop, this row is half-height and only accessible through pressing Fn. Given that there’s a lot free space around the keyboard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook doesn’t have free space at all. But the function keys can be pressed without Fn. These are separate keys that are even divided into groups of 4 using color coding and location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, have you seen which key is to the right of AltGr on modern ThinkPads? I don’t know what they were thinking, but now they have PrintScreen there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where? Where, I ask, is the context menu key that I use every day? It’s not there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the adminbook has it. Two, even! You can put it up by pressing Fn + Alt. Sorry, I couldn’t map it to a separate key due to lack of space. Just in case, I added the “Right Win” key as Fn + CtrlR. Maybe some people use it for something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the adminbook allows you to customize the keyboard to your liking. The keyboard is fully reprogrammable. You can assign the scan codes you need to the keys. Setting the keyboard parameters is done via the “KEY” button (Fn + F3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the adminbook has a keyboard backlight. It is turned on with Fn + B (below the trackpoint, you can even find it in the dark). The backlight here is similar to the ThinkPad ThinkLight. That is, it’s an LED above the display, illuminating the keyboard from the top. In this case, it is better than a backlight from below, because it allows you to distinguish the color of the keys. In addition, keys have several characters printed on them, while only English letters are usually made translucent to the backlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we’re on the topic of characters… Red letters are Ukrainian and Russian. I specifically drew them to show that keys have space for several alphabets: after all, English is not a native language for most of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there isn’t enough space for a full touchpad, the trackpoint is used as the positioning device. If you have no experience working with it — don’t worry, it’s actually quite handy. The mouse cursor moves with slight inclines of the trackpoint, like an analog joystick, and its three buttons (under the spacebar) work the same as on the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the left of the trackpoint keys is a fingerprint scanner. That makes it possible to login by fingerprint. It’s very convenient in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space bar has an NFC antenna location mark. You can simply read data from devices equipped with NFC, and you can make it to lock the system while not in use. For example, if you wear an NFC-equipped ring, it looks like this: when you remove hands from the keyboard, the computer locks after a certain time, and unlocks when you put hands on the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now the unexpected part. The keyboard and the trackpoint can work as a USB keyboard and mouse for an external computer! For this, there are USB Type C and MicroUSB connectors on the back, labeled «OTG». You can connect to an external computer using a standard USB cable from a phone (which is usually always with you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/e2/wa/m5/e2wam5d1bbckfdxpvqwl-i6aqle.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/e2/wa/m5/e2wam5d1bbckfdxpvqwl-i6aqle.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Right side of adminbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.2.2 — On the right: the power connector 5.5x2.5mm, the main LAN connector, POE indicator, USB 3.0 Type A, USB Type C (with alternate HDMI mode), microSD card reader and two «magic» buttons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching to the external keyboard mode is done with the «K» button on the right side of the adminbook. And there are actually three modes, since the keyboard+trackpoint combo can also work as a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover: to save energy, the keyboard and trackpoint can work autonomously from the rest of the adminbook. When the adminbook is turned off, pressing «K» can turn on only the keyboard and trackpoint to use them by connecting to another computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the keyboard is water-resistant. Excess water is drained down through the drainage holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Video subsystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;There are some devices that normally do not need a monitor and keyboard. For example, industrial computers, servers or DVRs. And since the monitor is «not needed», it is, in most cases, absent.&lt;p&gt;And when there is a need to configure such a device from the console, it can be a big surprise that the entire office is working on laptops and there is not a single stationary monitor within reach. Therefore, in some cases you have to take a monitor with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t need to worry about this if you have the adminbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the video outputs of the adminbook can switch «in the opposite direction» and work as video inputs by displaying the incoming image on the built-in screen. So, the adminbook can also replace the monitor (in addition to replace the mouse and keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/qr/f-/4aqrf-1sgstwwffhx-n4wr0p7ws.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/qr/f-/4aqrf-1sgstwwffhx-n4wr0p7ws.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Left side of adminbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.3.1 — On the left side of the adminbook, there are Mini DisplayPort, USB Type C (with alternate DisplayPort mode), SD card reader, USB 3.0 Type A connectors, HDMI, four audio connectors, VGA and power button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching modes between input and output is done by pressing the «M» button on the right side of the adminbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video subsystem, as well as the keyboard, can work autonomously — that is, when used as a monitor, the other parts of the adminbook remain disabled. To turn on to this mode also uses the «M» button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed screen adjustment (contrast, geometry, video input selection, etc.) is performed using the menu, brought up with the «SCR» button (Fn + F4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook has HDMI, MiniDP, VGA and USB Type C connectors (with DisplayPort and HDMI alternate mode) for video input / output. The integrated GPU can display the image simultaneously in three directions (including the integrated display).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook display is FullHD (1920x1080), 9.5’’, matte screen. The brightness is sufficient for working outside during the day. And to do it better, the set includes folding blinds for protection from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/nc/rh/k-ncrhphspvcoimfds1wurnzk3i.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/nc/rh/k-ncrhphspvcoimfds1wurnzk3i.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Blinds to protect from sunlight&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.3.2 — Blinds to protect from sunlight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to video output via these connectors, the adminbook can use wireless transmission via WiDi or Miracast protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Emulation of external drives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;One of the options for installing the operating system is to install it from a CD / DVD, but now very few computers have optical drives. USB connectors are everywhere, though. Therefore, the adminbook can pretend to be an external optical drive connected via USB.&lt;p&gt;That allows connecting it to any computer to install an operating system on it, while also running boot discs with test programs or antiviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To connect, it uses the same USB cable that’s used for connecting it to a desktop as an external keyboard/mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “CD” button (Fn + F2) controls the drive emulation — select a disc image (in an .iso file) and mount / unmount it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to copy data from a computer or to it, the adminbook can emulate an external hard drive connected via the same USB cable. HDD emulation is also enabled by the “CD” button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This button also turns on the emulation of bootable USB flash drives. They are now used to install operating systems almost more often than CDs. Therefore, the adminbook can pretend to be a bootable flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The .iso files are located on a separate partition of the hard disk. This allows you to use them regardless of the operating system. Moreover, in the emulation menu you can connect a virtual drive to one of the USB interfaces of the adminbook. This makes it possible to install an operating system on the adminbook using itself as an installation disc drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the adminbook is designed to work under Windows 10 and Debian / Kali / Ubuntu. The menu system called via function buttons with Fn works autonomously on a separate microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Rear connectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;First, a classic DB-9 connector for RS-232. Any admin notebook simply has to have it. We have it here, too, and galvanically isolated from the rest of the notebook.&lt;p&gt;In addition to RS-232, RS-485 widely used in industrial automation is supported. It has a two-wire and four-wire version, with a terminating resistor and without, with the ability to enable a protective offset. It can also work in RS-422 and UART modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these protocols are configured in the on-screen menu, called by the «COM» button (Fn + F8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are multiple protocols, it is possible to accidentally connect the equipment to a wrong connector and break it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent this from happening, when you turn off the computer (or go into sleep mode, or close the display lid), the COM port switches to the default mode. This may be a “port disabled” state, or enabling one of the protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/uz/ii/ig/uziiig_yr86yzdcnivkbapkbbgi.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/uz/ii/ig/uziiig_yr86yzdcnivkbapkbbgi.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Rear side of adminbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.1 — The rear connectors: DB-9, SATA + SATA Power, HD Mini SAS, the second wired LAN connector, two USB 3.0 Type A connectors, two USB 2.0 MicroB connectors, three USB Type C connectors, a USIM card tray, a PBD-12 pin connector (jack)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook has one more serial port. But if the first one uses the hardware UART chipset, the second one is connected to the USB 2.0 line through the FT232H converter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this, via COM2, you can exchange data via I2C, SMBus, SPI, JTAG, UART protocols or use it as 8 outputs for Bit-bang / GPIO. These protocols are used when working with microcontrollers, flashing firmware on routers and debugging any other electronics. For this purpose, pin connectors are usually used with a 2.54mm pitch. Therefore, COM2 is made to look like one of these connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/rc/ln/qdrclnoljgnlohthok4hgjb0be4.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/rc/ln/qdrclnoljgnlohthok4hgjb0be4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;USB to UART adapter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.2 — USB to UART adapter replaced by COM2 port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a secondary LAN interface at the back. Like the main one, it is gigabit-capable, with support for VLAN. Both interfaces are able to test the integrity of the cable (for pair length and short circuits), the presence of connected devices, available communication speeds, the presence of POE voltage. With the using a wiremap adapter on the other side (see chapter 17) it is possible to determine how the cable is connected to crimps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network interface menu is called with the “LAN” button (Fn + F6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook has a combined SATA + SATA Power connector, connected directly to the chipset. That makes it possible to perform low-level tests of hard drives that do not work through USB-SATA adapters. Previously, you had to do it through ExpressCards-type adapters, but the adminbook can do without them because it has a true SATA output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/dr/si/in/drsiinbafiyz8ztzwrowtvi0lk8.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/dr/si/in/drsiinbafiyz8ztzwrowtvi0lk8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;USB to SATA/IDE and ExpressCard to SATA adapters&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.3 — USB to SATA/IDE and ExpressCard to SATA adapters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adminbook also has a connector that no other laptops have — HD Mini SAS (SFF-8643). PCIe x4 is routed outside through this connector. Thus, it's possible to connect an external U.2 (directly) or M.2 type (through an adapter) drives. Or even a typical desktop PCIe expansion card (like a graphics card).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/ph/86/udph860bshazyd6lvuzvwgymwnk.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/ph/86/udph860bshazyd6lvuzvwgymwnk.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;HD Mini SAS to U.2 cable&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.4 — HD Mini SAS (SFF-8643) to U.2 cable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/dd/99/kxdd99krcllm5ooz67l_egcttym.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/dd/99/kxdd99krcllm5ooz67l_egcttym.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;U.2 drive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.5 — U.2 drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/de/gx/xndegxy5i1g7h2lwefs2jt1scpq.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/de/gx/xndegxy5i1g7h2lwefs2jt1scpq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;U.2 to M.2 adapter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.6 — U.2 to M.2 adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/z2/dd/hd/z2ddhdoioezdwov_nv9e3b0egsa.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/z2/dd/hd/z2ddhdoioezdwov_nv9e3b0egsa.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Custom adapter to PCIe from U.2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.5.7 — Combined adapter from U.2 to M.2 and PCIe (sample M.2 22110 drive is installed)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the limitations of the chipset don’t allow arbitrary use of PCIe lanes. In addition, the processor uses the same data lanes for PCIe and SATA. Therefore, the rear connectors can only work in two ways:&lt;br/&gt;— all four PCIe lanes go to the Mini SAS connector (the second network interface and SATA don’t work)&lt;br/&gt;— two PCIe lanes go to the Mini SAS, and two lanes to the second network interface and SATA connector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the back there are also two USB connectors (usual and Type C), which are constantly powered. That allows you to charge other devices from your notebook, even when the notebook is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Power Supply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The adminbook is designed to work in difficult and unpredictable conditions, therefore, it is able to receive power in various ways.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method number one&lt;/strong&gt; is Power Delivery. The power supply cable can be connected to any USB Type C connector (except the one marked “OTG”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second option&lt;/strong&gt; is from a normal 5V phone charger with a microUSB or USB Type C connector. At the same time, if you connect to the ports labeled QC 3.0, the QuickCharge fast charging standard will be supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third option&lt;/strong&gt; — from any source of 12-60V DC power. To connect, use a coaxial ( also known as “barrel”) 5.5x2.5mm power connector, often found in laptop power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For greater safety, the 12-60V power supply is galvanically isolated from the rest of the notebook. In addition, there’s reverse polarity protection. In fact, the adminbook can receive energy even if positive and negative ends are mismatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/xo/c3/juxoc3lxi7urqwgegyd6ida5h_8.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/xo/c3/juxoc3lxi7urqwgegyd6ida5h_8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Power cable&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.6.1 — The cable, connecting the power supply to the adminbook (terminated with 5.5x2.5mm connectors)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapters for a car cigarette lighter and crocodile clips are included in the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/-v/gv/l6-vgvqjrssirnvyi14czhi0mrc.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/-v/gv/l6-vgvqjrssirnvyi14czhi0mrc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adapter to crocodile clips&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.6.2 — Adapter from 5.5x2.5mm coaxial connector to crocodile clips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/an/gs/zwangsvfdvoievatpbfxqvxrszg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/an/gs/zwangsvfdvoievatpbfxqvxrszg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adapter to a car cigarette lighter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.6.3 — Adapter to a car cigarette lighter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fourth option&lt;/strong&gt; — Power Over Ethernet (POE) through the main network adapter. Supported options are 802.3af, 802.3at and Passive POE. Input voltage from 12 to 60V. This method is convenient if you have to work on the roof or on the tower, setting up Wi-Fi antennas. Power to them comes through Ethernet cables, and there is no other electricity on the tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POE electricity can be used in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;power the notebook only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forward to a second network adapter and power the notebook from batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power the notebook and the antenna at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prevent equipment damage, if one of the Ethernet cables is disconnected, the power to the second network interface is terminated. The power can only be turned on manually through the corresponding menu item.&lt;p&gt;When using the 802.3af / at protocols, you can set the power class that the adminbook will request from the power supply device. This and other POE properties are configured from the menu called with the “LAN” button (Fn + F6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can remotely reset Ubiquity access points (which is done by closing certain wires in the cable) with the second network interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indicator next to the main network interface shows the presence and type of POE: green — 802.3af / at, red — Passive POE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last, fifth&lt;/strong&gt; power supply is the battery. Here it’s a LiPol, 42W/hour battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case the external power supply does not provide sufficient power, the missing power can be drawn from the battery. Thus, it can draw power from the battery and external sources at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Display unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The display can tilt 180 degrees, and it’s locked with latches while closed (opens with a button on the front side). When the display is closed, adminbook doesn’t react to pressing any external buttons.&lt;p&gt;In addition to the screen, the notebook lid contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;front and rear cameras with lights, microphones, activity LEDs and mechanical curtains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LED of the upper backlight of the keyboard (similar to ThinkLight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LED indicators for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDD and others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wireless protocol antennas (in the blue plastic insert)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photo sensors and LEDs for the infrared remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic insert for the antennas does not reach the corners of the display lid. This is done because in the «traveling» notebooks the corners are most affected by impacts, and it's desirable that they be made of metal.&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Webcams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The notebook has 2 webcams. The front-facing one is 8MP (4K / UltraHD), while the “selfie” one is 2MP (FullHD). Both cameras have a backlight controlled by separate buttons (Fn + G and Fn + H). Each camera has a mechanical curtain and an activity LED. The shifted mechanical curtain also turns off the microphones of the corresponding side (configurable).&lt;p&gt;The external camera has two quick launch buttons — Fn + 1 takes an instant photo, Fn + 2 turns on video recording. The internal camera has a combination of Fn + Q and Fn + W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can configure cameras and microphones from the menu called up by the “CAM” button (Fn + F10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Indicator row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It has the following indicators: Microphone, NumLock, ScrollLock, hard drive access, battery charge, external power connection, sleep mode, mobile connection, WiFi, Bluetooth.&lt;p&gt;Three indicators are made to shine through the back side of the display lid, so that they can be seen while the lid is closed: external power connection, battery charge, sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicators are color-coded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microphone — lights up red when all microphones are muted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery charge: more than 60% is green, 30-60% is yellow, less than 30% is red, less than 10% is blinking red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;External power: green — power is supplied, the battery is charged; yellow — power is supplied, the battery is charging; red — there is not enough external power to operate, the battery is drained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile: 4G (LTE) — green, 3G — yellow, EDGE / GPRS — red, blinking red — on, but no connection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi: green — connected to 5 GHz, yellow — to 2.4 GHz, red — on, but not connected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can configure the indication with the “IND” button (Fn + F9)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. Infrared remote control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Near the indicators (on the front and back of the display lid) there are infrared photo sensors and LEDs to recording and playback commands from IR remotes. You can set it up, as well as emulate a remote control by pressing the “IR” button (Fn + F5).&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;11. Wireless interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;WiFi — dual-band, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac with support for Wireless Direct, Intel WI-Di / Miracast, Wake On Wireless LAN.&lt;p&gt;You ask, why is Miracast here? Because is already embedded in many WiFi chips, so its presence does not lead to additional costs. But you can transfer the image wirelessly to TVs, projectors and TV set-top boxes, that already have Miracast built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Bluetooth, there’s nothing special. It’s version 4.2 or newest. By the way, the keyboard and trackpoint have a separate Bluetooth module. This is much easier than connect them to the system-wide module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the adminbook has a built-in cellular modem for 4G (LTE) / 3G / EDGE / GPRS, as well as a GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / Beidou receiver. This receiver also doesn’t cost much, because it’s already built into the 4G modem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also an NFC communication module, with the antenna under the spacebar. Antennas of all other wireless interfaces are in a plastic insert above the display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can configure wireless interfaces with the «WRLS» button (Fn + F7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;12. USB connectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In total, four USB 3.0 Type A connectors and four USB 3.1 Type C connectors are built into the adminbook. Peripherals are connected to the adminbook through these.&lt;p&gt;One more Type C and MicroUSB are allocated only for keyboard / mouse / drive emulation (denoted as “OTG”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;«QC 3.0» labeled MicroUSB connector can not only be used for power, but it can switch to normal USB 2.0 port mode, except using MicroB instead of normal Type A. Why is it necessary? Because to flash some electronics you sometimes need non-standard USB A to USB A cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to not make adapters outselves, you can use a regular phone charging cable by plugging it into this Micro B connector. Or use an USB A to USB Type C cable (if you have one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/0p/90/7e/0p907ezbunekqwobeogjgs5fgsa.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/0p/90/7e/0p907ezbunekqwobeogjgs5fgsa.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;USB A to USB A cable&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.12.1 — Homemade USB A to USB A cable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since USB Type C supports alternate modes, it makes sense to use it. Alternate modes are when the connector works as HDMI or DisplayPort video outputs. Though you’ll need adapters to connect it to a TV or monitor. Or appropriate cables that have Type C on one end and HDMI / DP on the other. However, USB Type C to USB Type C cables might soon become the most common video transfer cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Type C connector on the left side of the adminbook supports an alternate Display Port mode, and on the right side, HDMI. Like the other video outputs of the adminbook, they can work as both input and output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing left to say is that Type C is bidirectional in regard to power delivery — it can both take in power as well as output it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;13. Other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;On the left side there are four audio connectors: Line In, Line Out, Microphone and the combo headset jack (headphones + microphone). Supports simple stereo, quad and 5.1 mode output.&lt;p&gt;Audio outputs are specially placed next to the video connectors, so that when connected to any equipment, the wires are on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built-in speakers are on the sides. Outside, they are covered with grills and acoustic fabric with water-repellent impregnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also two slots for memory cards — full-size SD and MicroSD. If you think that the first slot is needed only for copying photos from the camera — you are mistaken. Now, both single-board computers like Raspberry Pi and even rack-mount servers are loaded from SD cards. MicroSD cards are also commonly found outside of phones. In general, you need both card slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensors more familiar to phones — a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a magnetometer — are built into the lid of the notebook. Thanks to this, one can determine where the notebook cameras are directed and use this for augmented reality, as well as navigation. Sensors are controlled via the menu using the “SNSR” button (Fn + F11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the function buttons with Fn, F1 (“MAN”) and F12 (“ETC”) I haven’t described yet. The first is a built-in guide on connectors, modes and how to use the adminbook. The second is the settings of non-standard subsystems that have not separate buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;14. What's inside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The adminbook is based on the Core i5-7Y57 CPU (Kaby Lake architecture). Although it’s less of a CPU, but more of a real SOC (System On a Chip). That is, almost the entire computer (without peripherals) fits in one chip the size of a thumb nail (2x1.6 cm).&lt;p&gt;It emits from 3.5W to 7W of heat (depends on the frequency). So, a passive cooling system is adequate in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8GB of RAM are installed by default, expandable up to 16GB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 256GB M.2 2280 SSD, connected with two PCIe lanes, is used as the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi + Bluetooth and WWAN + GNSS adapters are also designed as M.2 modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAM, the hard drive and wireless adapters are located on the top of the motherboard and can be replaced by the user — just unscrew and lift the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battery is assembled from four LP545590 cells and can also be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOC and other irreplaceable hardware are located on the bottom of the motherboard. The heating components for cooling are pressed directly against the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;External connectors are located on daughter boards connected to the motherboard via ribbon cables. That allows to release different versions of the adminbook based on the same motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the possible version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/j9/sw/vq/j9swvqfi1-ituc4u9nr6-ijv3nq.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/j9/sw/vq/j9swvqfi1-ituc4u9nr6-ijv3nq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adminbook A4 (front view)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.14.1 — Adminbook A4 (front view)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/fq/ag/pwfqagvrluf1dbnmcd0rt-0eyc0.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/fq/ag/pwfqagvrluf1dbnmcd0rt-0eyc0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adminbook A4 (back view)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.14.2 — Adminbook A4 (back view)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/ir/8i/mnir8in1pssve0m2tymevz2sue4.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/ir/8i/mnir8in1pssve0m2tymevz2sue4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Adminbook A4 (keyboard)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.14.3 — Adminbook A4 (keyboard)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an adminbook with a 12.5” display, its overall dimensions are 210x297mm (A4 paper format). The keyboard is full-size, with a standard key size (only the top row is a bit narrower). All the standard keys are there, except for the numpad and the Right Win, available with Fn keys. And trackpad added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;15. The underside of the adminbook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Not expecting anything interesting from the bottom? But there is!&lt;p&gt;First I will say a few words about the rubber feet. On my ThinkPad, they sometimes fall away and lost. I don't know if it's a bad glue, or a backpack is not suitable for a notebook, but it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the adminbook, the rubber feet are screwed in (the screws are slightly buried in rubber, so as not to scratch the tables). The feet are sufficiently streamlined so that they cling less to other objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bottom there are visible drainage holes marked with a water drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the four threaded holes for connecting the adminbook with fasteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/3d/q9/ku/3dq9kus6t7ql3rh5mbpfo3_xqng.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/3d/q9/ku/3dq9kus6t7ql3rh5mbpfo3_xqng.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The underside of the adminbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.15.1 — The underside of the adminbook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large hole in the center has a tripod thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/t5/e5/ps/t5e5ps3iasu2j-22uc2rgl_5x_y.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/t5/e5/ps/t5e5ps3iasu2j-22uc2rgl_5x_y.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Camera clamp mount&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.15.2 — Camera clamp mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it necessary? Because sometimes you have to hang on high, holding the mast with one hand, holding the notebook with the second, and typing something on the third… Unfortunately, I am not Shiva, so these tricks are not easy for me. And you can just screw the adminbook by a camera mount to any protruding part of the structure and free your hands!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No protruding parts? No problem. A plate with neodymium magnets is screwed to three other holes and the adminbook is magnetised to any steel surface — even vertical! As you see, opening the display by 180° is pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/28/ub/ua28ubhpyrmountubiqjegiibem.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/28/ub/ua28ubhpyrmountubiqjegiibem.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Fastening with magnets&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.15.3 — Fastening with magnets and shaped holes for nails / screws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if there is no metal? For example, working on the roof, and next to only a wooden wall. Then you can screw 1-2 screws in the wall and hang the adminbook on them. To do this, there are special slots in the mount, plus an eyelet on the handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For especially difficult cases, there’s an arm mount. This is not very convenient, but better than nothing. Besides, it allows you to navigate even with a working notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/tp/fo/0y/tpfo0y_8gku4bmlbeqwfux1j4me.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/tp/fo/0y/tpfo0y_8gku4bmlbeqwfux1j4me.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Arm mount&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.15.4 — Arm mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, these three holes use a regular metric thread, specifically so that you can make some DIY fastening and fasten it with ordinary screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except fasteners, an additional radiator can be screwed to these holes, so that you can work for a long time under high load or at high ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k4/jo/eq/k4joeqhmaxgvzhnxno6z3alg5go.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k4/jo/eq/k4joeqhmaxgvzhnxno6z3alg5go.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Radiator&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.15.5 — Adminbook with additional radiator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;16. Accessories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The adminbook has some unique features, and some of them are implemented using equipment designed specifically for the adminbook. Therefore, these accessories are immediately included. However, non-unique accessories are also available immediately.&lt;p&gt;Here is a complete list of both:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fasteners with magnets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arm mount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heatsink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screen blinds covering it from sunlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HD Mini SAS to U.2 cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combined adapter from U.2 to M.2 and PCIe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power cable, terminated by coaxial 5.5x2.5mm connectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adapter from power cable to cigarette lighter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adapter from power cable to crocodile clips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different adapters from the power cable to coaxial connectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;universal power supply and power cord from it into the outlet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;17. Power supply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Since this is a power supply for a system administrator's notebook, it would be nice to make it universal, capable of powering various electronic devices. Fortunately, the vast majority of devices are connected via coaxial connectors or USB. I mean devices with external power supplies: routers, switches, notebooks, nettops, single-board computers, DVRs, IPTV set top boxes, satellite tuners and more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/zs/ve/jvzsveqavvi2ihuoajjnsr1xlp0.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/zs/ve/jvzsveqavvi2ihuoajjnsr1xlp0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Power adapters&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.17.1 — Adapters from 5.5x2.5mm coaxial connector to other types of connectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t many connector types, which allows to get by with an adjustable-voltage PSU and adapters for the necessary connectors. It also needs to support various power delivery standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our case, the power supply supports the following modes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Power Delivery — displayed as &lt;strong&gt;[pd]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Charge &lt;strong&gt;[qc]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.3af/at &lt;strong&gt;[at]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;voltage from 5 to 54 volts in 0.5V increments (displayed voltage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/jm/qv/fjjmqvdhezywuyh9ew3umy9wgmg.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/jm/qv/fjjmqvdhezywuyh9ew3umy9wgmg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;7-segment indicator&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.17.2 — Mode display on the 7-segment indicator (1.9. = 19.5V)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/h9/zg/u0/h9zgu0ngl01rvhgivlw7fb49gpq.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/h9/zg/u0/h9zgu0ngl01rvhgivlw7fb49gpq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Front and top sides of power supply&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.17.3 — Front and top sides of power supply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USB outputs on the power supply (5V 2A) are always on. On the other outputs the voltage is applied by pressing the ON/OFF button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desired mode is selected with the MODE button and this selection is remembered even when the power is turned off. The modes are listed like this: pd, qc, at, then a series of voltages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voltage increases by pressing and holding the MODE button, decreases by short pressing. Step to the right — 1 Volt, step to the left — 0.5 Volt. Half a volt is needed because some equipment requires, for example, 19.5 volts. These half volts are displayed on the display with decimal points (19V -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;[19]&lt;/strong&gt;, 19.5V -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;[1.9.]&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When power is on, the green LED is on. When a short-circuit or overcurrent protection is triggered, &lt;strong&gt;[SH]&lt;/strong&gt; is displayed, and the LED lights up red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Power Delivery and Quick Charge modes, voltage is applied to the USB outputs (Type A and Type C). Only one of them can be used at one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 802.3af/at modes, the power supply acts as an injector, combining the supply voltage with data from the LAN connector and supplying it to the POE connector. Power is supplied only if a device with 802.3af or 802.3at support is plugged into the POE connector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the simple voltage supply mode, electricity throu the POE connector is issued immediately, without any checks. This is the so-called Passive POE — positive charge goes to conductors 4 and 5, and negative charge to conductors 7 and 8. At the same time, the voltage is applied to the coaxial connector. Adapters for various types of connectors are used in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power supply unit has a built-in button to remotely reset Ubiquity access points. This is a very useful feature that allows you to reset the antenna to factory settings without having to climb on the mast. I don’t know — is any other manufacturers support a feature like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power supply also has the passive wiremap adapter, which allows you to determine the correct Ethernet cable crimping. The active part is located in the Ethernet ports of the adminbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/bm/ws/ppbmws4g1o5j05eyqqulnwuuwge.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/bm/ws/ppbmws4g1o5j05eyqqulnwuuwge.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Back side and wiremap adapter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig.17.4 — Back side and wiremap adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the network cable tester built into the adminbook will not replace a professional OTDR, but for most tasks it will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent overheating, part of the PSU’s body acts as an aluminum heatsink. Power supply power — 65 watts, size 10x5x4cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;18. Afterword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;“It won’t fit into such a small case!” — the sceptics will probably say. To be frank, I also sometimes think that way when re-reading what I wrote above.&lt;p&gt;And then I open the 3D model and see, that all parts fits. Of course, I am not an electronic engineer, and for sure I miss some important things. But, I hope that if there are mistakes, they are “overcorrections”. That is, real engineers would fit all of that into a case even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By and large, the adminbook can be divided into 5 functional parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the usual part, as in all notebooks — processor, memory, hard drive, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keyboard and trackpoint that can work separately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autonomous video subsystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subsystem for managing non-standard features (enable / disable POE, infrared remote control, PCIe mode switching, LAN testing, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power subsystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we consider them separately, then everything looks quite feasible.&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;SOC Kaby Lake&lt;/strong&gt; contains a CPU, a graphics accelerator, a memory controller, PCIe, SATA controller, USB controller for 6 USB3 and 10 USB2 outputs, Gigabit Ethernet controller, 4 lanes to connect webcams, integrated audio and etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that remains is to trace the lanes to connectors and supply power to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard and trackpoint&lt;/strong&gt; is a separate module that connects via USB to the adminbook or to an external connector. Nothing complicated here: USB and Bluetooth keyboards are very widespread. In our case, in addition, needs to make a rewritable table of scan codes and transfer non-standard keys over a separate interface other than USB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The video subsystem&lt;/strong&gt; receives the video signal from the adminbook or from external connectors. In fact, this is a regular monitor with a video switchboard plus a couple of VGA converters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-standard features&lt;/strong&gt; are managed independently of the operating system. The easiest way to do it with via a separate microcontroller which receives codes for pressing non-standard keys (those that are pressed with Fn) and performs the corresponding actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you have to display a menu to change the settings, the microcontroller has a video output, connected to the adminbook for the duration of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internal PSU&lt;/strong&gt; is galvanically isolated from the rest of the system. Why not? On habr.com there was an article about making a 100W, 9.6mm thickness planar transformer! And it only costs $0.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the electronic part of the adminbook is quite feasible. There is the programming part, and I don’t know which part will harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concludes my fairly long article. It long, even though I simplified, shortened and threw out minor details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal end of the article was a link to an online store where you can buy an adminbook. But it's not yet designed and released. Since this requires money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have no experience with Kickstarter or Indigogo. Maybe you have this experience? Let's do it together!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Show HN: GuiLite – Tiny UI framework, runs on MCU without OS or Qt/MFC/UWP/XCode</title>
<link>https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is GuiLite?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GuiLite has 5000 lines of C++ code, providing &lt;strong&gt;UI framework for all platforms&lt;/strong&gt;, could run on iOS, Android, GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS and &lt;strong&gt;all ARM Linux&lt;/strong&gt; IOT platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GuiLite is OS independent, even could run on any kind of &lt;strong&gt;MCU without OS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GuiLite is a embedded UI framework. It can work with Qt/MFC/UWP/XCode, which means you can get not only GuiLite features but also iOS/Android/macOS/Qt/MFC/UWP features as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GuiLite can work with other languages(e.g. Swift, Java, C#).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️We never encourage people accept GuiLite, but want people understand UI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚙️We hope GuiLite is small enough to help you understand how UI work, and build unique UI yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👑You should be the king of your UI, not any UI library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New feature: Demo on MCU -- HelloWave + HelloParticle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite/blob/master/doc/HelloWave.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite/raw/master/doc/HelloWave.gif&quot; alt=&quot;HelloWave&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite/blob/master/doc/HelloParticle.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite/raw/master/doc/HelloParticle.gif&quot; alt=&quot;HelloParticle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MCU Hardware: STM32F103ZET6(512K ROM, 64K RAM) + 240*320 16bits color TFT LCD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MCU Software: None OS + GuiLite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello Wave has only 100+ lines code!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteSamples/blob/master/HelloWave/UIcode/UIcode.cpp&quot;&gt;Check the code&lt;/a&gt;. Showing you how to use wave widget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello Particle has only 100- lines code!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteSamples/blob/master/HelloParticle/UIcode/UIcode.cpp&quot;&gt;Check the code&lt;/a&gt;. Showing you how to develop particle system.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Apple restores Google’s internal iOS apps after certificate misuse punishment</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/apple-ban-google-data-app/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/apple-ban-google-data-app/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has blocked Google from distributing its internal-only iOS apps on its corporate network after a TechCrunch investigation found the search giant abusing the certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with Apple to fix a temporary disruption to some of our corporate iOS apps, which we expect will be resolved soon,” said a &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson. A spokesperson for Apple said: “We are working together with Google to help them reinstate their enterprise certificates very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: 7pm pacific: Apple has restored Google’s Enterprise Certificate so its internal apps will now function, TechCrunch has confirmed with a source after Bloomberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhbergen/status/1091168798856556544?s=21&quot;&gt;Mark Bergen&lt;/a&gt; noted the development. A Google spokesperson tells they “can confirm that our internal corporate apps have been restored.” Googlers had lost access to employee-only iOS versions of their pre-launch test apps like YouTube, Gmail, and Calendar as well as their food and shuttle apps as well, causing a massive loss of productivity that will surely make it more careful about abiding by Apple’s policies.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/&quot;&gt;reported Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that Google was using an Apple-issued certificate that allows the company to create and build internal apps for its staff for one of its consumer-facing apps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/&quot;&gt;called Screenwise Meter&lt;/a&gt;, in violation of Apple’s rules. The app was designed to collect an extensive amount of data from a person’s iPhone for research, but using the special certificate allowed the company to allow users to bypass Apple’s App Store. Google later apologized, and said that the app “should not have operated under Apple’s developer enterprise program — this was a mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It followed in the footsteps of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook,&lt;/a&gt; which we first reported earlier this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/&quot;&gt;was also abusing its internal-only certificates&lt;/a&gt; for a research app — which the company used to pay teenagers to vacuum up their phone’s web activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple invalidating Google’s Enterprise Certificate mean its Screenwise Meter app won’t work for iPhones and nor will any other app for which the search giant relies on the certificate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Verge reporter earlier that many internal Google apps have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate&quot;&gt;also stopped working&lt;/a&gt;. That means many early and pre-release versions of its consumer-facing apps, like Google Maps, Hangouts, Gmail and other employee-only apps, such as its transportation apps, are no longer functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook faced a similar rebuke after Apple stepped in. We reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/&quot;&gt;after Apple’s ban was handed down&lt;/a&gt;, many of Facebook’s pre-launch, test-only versions of Facebook and Instagram stopped working, as well as other employee-only apps for coordinating office collaboration, travel and seeing the company’s daily lunch schedule. Neither block affects apps that consumers download from Apple’s App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has more than 35,000 employees. Google has more than 94,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Googlecand Facebook’s Certificates have been restored and their office mayhem has ceased, attention will likely turn to other abuses of the program and Apple’s power in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josh Constine contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Learn React fundamentals</title>
<link>https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this tutorial is to quickly get you off the ground with &lt;code&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; concepts. This tutorial has hands on exercises which I consider to be the most important part of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this tutorial works is that first you have to checkout this project on your computer, and run the application locally. Then open the application on a browser and you can go through the tutorial as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app/blob/master/public/Learn_React_App.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app/raw/master/public/Learn_React_App.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Learn React App&quot; title=&quot;Learn React App&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checkout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout the project to your computer using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/tyroprogrammer/learn-react-app.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environment Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't already have &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; installed on your local machine please execute below command to install &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install -g yarn
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the root directory of the project please execute below command to install all the project dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;yarn install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starting application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the root directory of the project please execute below command to start the tutorial application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this is complete, the application will be deployed on port &lt;code&gt;3000&lt;/code&gt;. Open a browser and navigate to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following the tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorial on this application are fairly straightforward to follow. Each tutorial has one or more exercises. You'll see once you are in the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise panel has split view. The left hand side of the screen has your solution rendered and the right hand side of the screen has the target solution. Right above the exercise panel you'll see location of exercise files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please open the execise file on your favorite editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime, IntelliJ etc.) and start making changes by following the instructions. Exercise files are heavily commented. Read through the comments and you should be able to write up the solution. If you have any confusion you can refer to the solution file for that exercise. Every time you make changes to the exercise file and save it, the browser will reload automatically reflecting your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exercise Comment Guide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most comments in the exercise files starts with one of the below signs. This is to help you understand what you should do to the code immediately following this comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🏆 - &lt;strong&gt;Trophy&lt;/strong&gt; - Describes the overall goal of the exercise. You can find this at the top of the exercise file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 - &lt;strong&gt;Light Bulb&lt;/strong&gt; - General information regarding the code immediately following this comment. You might find it throughout the code. No action is required on your part, just read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✏️ - &lt;strong&gt;Pencil&lt;/strong&gt; - You are supposed to edit the code immediately following this comment. It is followed by a description of the change that you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🧭 - &lt;strong&gt;Compass&lt;/strong&gt; - When the description of change is not enough, compass will give you more direction. You will find it alongside the pencil when more elaborate instruction is deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🚨 - &lt;strong&gt;Alarm&lt;/strong&gt; - This means danger. Read the comment carefully. Usually it's used to say you shouldn't change the code immediately following this. It will create havoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;Do I need to install `yarn` or can I use `npm`?
&lt;p&gt;You don't really need yarn. Just use npm if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;Which browser should I use?
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial has been tested in Chrome only so I highly recommend you use Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;Which code editor should I use for exercise?
&lt;p&gt;Anything really (Sublime, Atom, VS Code, IntelliJ) - its your preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;I accidently deleted something in exercise that I shouldn't have. What should I do?
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to just revert back to the previous version on your editor. If you want to start anew, then just checkout that particular file from github again using something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git checkout HEAD --  exercise/01-helloWorld.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you went through the exercise and saw some inconsistencies or if you have an idea to make the overall tutorial better please feel free to open a PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Want to Stop Fake News? Pay for the Real Thing</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/google-facebook-fake-news-journalism.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/google-facebook-fake-news-journalism.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as “regulators” of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/layoffs_huffpost_buzzfeed_gannett.php&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;planned layoffs&lt;/a&gt; at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/google-announces-a-300m-google-news-initiative-though-this-isnt-about-giving-out-grants-directly-to-newsrooms-like-it-does-in-europe/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pledge to spend $300 million&lt;/a&gt; each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We can start with the fact that “free” isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/business/media/youtube-reaches-settlement-over-songwriting-royalties.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;deals to pay music publishers&lt;/a&gt; when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on “free.” Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There’s no reason those who produce the news shouldn’t enjoy the same intellectual property protections as songwriters and producers (regulators in Europe are looking at replicating some of these safeguards for journalism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The tech giants are also run as “walled gardens” that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading “news” that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly. Recognizing and promoting publishers that have consistently delivered quality news content can’t be that difficult for sophisticated tech companies. And there are a range of qualified independent ratings organizations, such as NewsGuard, that could help them separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Whether they like to admit it or not, Facebook and Google are at real risk when it comes to the news business. Under the adage “You break it, you buy it,” the platforms now own what happens when quality journalism goes away. A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/27/david-simon-wire-newspapers&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/27/david-simon-wire-newspapers&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: “Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2019/1/25/18197528/buzzfeed-group-nine-merger-talk-comcast-nbc-discovery-peretti-lerer&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;talked about digital publishers merging&lt;/a&gt; to gain more negotiating leverage over the tech platforms on these issues. Legislation sponsored by Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/cicilline-introduces-journalism-competition-and-preservation-act%7D&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;would allow news publishers&lt;/a&gt; to collectively negotiate with the two companies without violating antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple blocks Google from running its internal iOS apps</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;65L3Yj&quot;&gt;Apple shut down Google’s ability to distribute its internal iOS apps earlier today. A person familiar with the situation told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that early versions of Google Maps, Hangouts, Gmail, and other pre-release beta apps stopped working alongside employee-only apps like a Gbus app for transportation and Google’s internal cafe app. The block came after Google was found to be in violation of Apple’s app distribution policy, and followed a similar shutdown that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps&quot;&gt;issued to Facebook earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RIm5V4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/apple-ban-google-data-app/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhbergen/status/1091168798856556544?s=21&quot;&gt;Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen&lt;/a&gt; reported late Thursday that the apps’ functionality had been restored; Apple appears to have worked more closely with Google to fix this situation. “We are working together with Google to help them reinstate their enterprise certificates very quickly,” an Apple spokesperson earlier told &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1091097938393128960&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;S36C8N&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple blocked Facebook and then Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FexzJt&quot;&gt;Apple’s move to block Google’s developer certificate comes just a day after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18204064/apple-google-monitoring-phone-usage-screenwise-meter&quot;&gt;Google disabled its Screenwise Meter app&lt;/a&gt; following press coverage. Google’s private app was designed to monitor how people use their iPhones, similar to Facebook’s research app. Google’s app also relied on Apple’s enterprise program, which enables the distribution of internal apps within a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BxWOYs&quot;&gt;In an earlier statement over Facebook’s certificate removal, Apple did warn that “any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked.” Facebook’s internal iOS apps have since resumed functioning, as the social network said this afternoon that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18206020/apple-facebook-internal-ios-apps-restores-enterprise-certificate&quot;&gt;Apple had restored its enterprise certificate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;l8eNCH&quot;&gt;Apple is clearly sticking to its rules and applying them equally to Facebook, Google, and likely many other companies that get caught breaking Apple’s rules in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xqvA1f&quot;&gt;There’s growing evidence that a number of companies are using Apple’s enterprise program to distribute apps to consumers. iOS developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thefaj/status/1091087789704105984&quot;&gt;Alex Fajkowski has discovered&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon, DoorDash, and Sonos all distribute beta versions of their apps to non-employees. Apple may be forced to take action against these apps, or to even revamp its entire enterprise program in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline text-black-50&quot;&gt;By &lt;a rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Christopher Forno&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-01-31&quot; title=&quot;31 January 2019&quot;&gt;31 January 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for .com names, I've been frustrated by how many are already taken but appear to be unused. It can feel like people are registering every pronounceable combination of letters in every major language, and even the unpronounceable short ones. Is there rampant domain speculation, or do I just think of the same names as everyone else? Let's look at the data...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently 137 million .com domain names registered.&lt;sup id=&quot;note1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of these, roughly 1/3 are in use (businesses, personal websites, email, etc.), another 1/3 appear to be unused, and the last 1/3 are used for a variety of speculative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.com Domain Usage, from a sample of 2,188 domains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click a category to go to its explanation. 99% CI ±3%&lt;sup id=&quot;note2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I Determined These Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by crawling a random sample of the domains from the top-level .com DNS zone file,&lt;sup id=&quot;note3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; until reaching 100,000 valid domains.&lt;sup id=&quot;note4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each domain, I collected the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the WHOIS record&lt;sup id=&quot;note5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all DNS records for the top-level domain and the &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain&lt;sup id=&quot;note6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP and HTTPS&lt;sup id=&quot;note7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; responses (status code, headers, and bodies) for the root page of the top-level domain and the &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screenshots of the root page as viewed by Mozilla Firefox 64.0 on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crawl took a little over 48 hours from a single server located in a Singapore data center. I ran a follow-up crawl for any domains that failed to connect over HTTP or HTTPS (in case of transient errors). And finally, for the 2,188 domains to be categorized I manually checked any that had failed in case the crawler had timed out or had DOM events blocked by JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I wrote a script to help me categorize websites based on their screenshot and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/categorize-app.png&quot;/&gt; The categorization script presents the possible categories as a list of buttons, with Content being the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the script to categorize domains over the next 2 days.&lt;sup id=&quot;note8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In some cases the screenshot and body were not sufficient, so I manually opened the domain in a web browser for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary Statistics and Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top 10 .com Domain Registrars, from a sample of 100,000 domains GoDaddy.com, LLC Tucows Domains Inc. Alibaba Cloud Computing (Beijing) Co., Ltd. Network Solutions, LLC eNom, Inc. NameCheap, Inc. 1&amp;amp;1 Internet SE PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com Xin Net Technology Corporation Wild West Domains, LLC Google Inc. OVH the remaining 1,841 registrars 33% 5.3% 4.2% 3.8% 3.5% 3.3% 2.5% 2.5% 2.1% 1.7% 1.5% 1.5% 35%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GoDaddy is the registrar for 1/3 of all .com domain names. That's roughly 45 million domain names. Of those, 1 in 3 have parking pages. In other words, more than 10% of all .com domain names host GoDaddy ads pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there are 1,851 registrars in the sample, the majority of those are controlled by a smaller number of operators. For example, over 1,000 of the registrars are controlled by DropCatch.com alone.&lt;sup id=&quot;note9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domain-names-are-unused#footnote9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% of domains were registered within the last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domain ages according to WHOIS creation dates, from a sample of 100,000 domains domain age (in years) 0 5 10 15 20 25 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Domain Categories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These categories evolved as I worked. For example, I hadn't anticipated the high number of gambling domains (aliases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most categories I've included a random sample of screenshots from that category, excluding redundant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-content&quot;&gt;Content (31% or ~43 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is the category of any domain with a website displaying unique content. It doesn't matter what the content is, as long as it appears to be unique for the domain and publicly accessible. When I was unsure, I placed domains in this category by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/content.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-ads&quot;&gt;Ads (23% or ~31 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that half the domains in this category are GoDaddy parking pages, on which GoDaddy places Google ads based on the keywords related to the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/ads.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-no-web-server&quot;&gt;No Web Server (11% or ~16 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was unable to connect to, or receive a valid response from, port 80 or 443 for either the top-level domain or the www subdomain &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the domain had no MX records, I placed the domain in this category. Some of these domains likely have some non-web use, such as an FTP or video game server, but I expect them to be a small fraction. Additionally, the crawling server was only configured for IPv4, so any IPv6-only websites would have been grouped here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-empty&quot;&gt;Empty (9.2% or ~13 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Empty domain is one for which a web server is answering requests, but returning empty pages, 404s, or unfilled templates (such as default WordPress installs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between an Empty domain and a Parked domain is that the Empty domain has presumably been configured by the user, but no content has been added yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/empty.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-for-sale&quot;&gt;For Sale (7.1% or ~9.8 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many domains are listed For Sale, usually by domain investors, through various brokers and marketplaces. Nearly half of this category appears to be domains sold by HugeDomains, although their website lists only &quot;over 200,000&quot; domains available for purchase (a fraction of their ~4 million domains if the sample is representative). I only included domains from recognizable marketplaces or when the contact details were were not part of an ad placement, as ad networks and domain brokers will often falsely claim that they represent a domain owner (I categorized all such domains as Ads instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/for-sale.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-error&quot;&gt;Error (5.7% or ~7.9 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a domain returned any type of error, whether an HTTP error or an in-page error, it belongs to this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I might have miscategorized some Private domains as Errors if they used basic authentication, as I did not distinguish between 403 Forbidden (due to no basic auth credentials) and other errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/error.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-parked&quot;&gt;Parked (4.8% or ~6.5 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parked domains are those that display a page from the registrar or host explaining that the domain has not been set up yet. To qualify as Parked, a domain had to serve a page without any external ads. It could advertise its own services, but it couldn't place ads from an ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/parked.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-gambling&quot;&gt;Gambling (3.0% or ~4 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All websites in this category are in Chinese and are operating under aliases, often short strings of numbers or consonants (e.g. 17770012 or tdwhtr). They follow common templates and contain similar images, often with automatically-generated logos. I assume their purpose is to attract people who think the names are lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/gambling.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-mail&quot;&gt;Mail (2.6% or ~3.5 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any domain not in any other category, but with MX DNS records (for email), I categorized as Mail. I did not attempt to see if the mail server was working or if delivery was possible. It's possible that many of these domains are not actually used for email, but I've given them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-redirect&quot;&gt;Redirect (1.1% or ~1.6 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redirects include vanity domains pointing to Facebook pages, alternative names for businesses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-private&quot;&gt;Private (0.64% or ~0.9 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private domains did not appear to have any content accessible without first logging in (or in some cases registering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://singaporedatacompany.com/blog/how-many-domains-are-unused/screenshots/private.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;category-porn&quot;&gt;Porn (0.59% or ~0.8 million)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to gambling websites, a number of pornographic websites operate under various aliases. The websites were predominantly in Chinese and the domains followed similar naming patterns. As many of the sites display pornographic material directly (not after a warning), I've not included the screenshots here.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The UAE’s secret hacking team of U.S. mercenaries</title>
<link>https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-spying-raven-specialreport-idUKKCN1PO1A6</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-spying-raven-specialreport-idUKKCN1PO1A6</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two weeks after leaving her position as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. National Security Agency in 2014, Lori Stroud was in the Middle East working as a hacker for an Arab monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had joined Project Raven, a clandestine team that included more than a dozen former U.S. intelligence operatives recruited to help the United Arab Emirates engage in surveillance of other governments, militants and human rights activists critical of the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud and her team, working from a converted mansion in Abu Dhabi known internally as “the Villa,” would use methods learnt from a decade in the U.S intelligence community to help the UAE hack into the phones and computers of its enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud had been recruited by a Maryland cybersecurity contractor to help the Emiratis launch hacking operations, and for three years, she thrived in the job. But in 2016, the Emiratis moved Project Raven to a UAE cybersecurity firm named DarkMatter. Before long, Stroud and other Americans involved in the effort say they saw the mission cross a red line: targeting fellow Americans for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am working for a foreign intelligence agency who is targeting U.S. persons,” she told Reuters. “I am officially the bad kind of spy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Project Raven reveals how former U.S. government hackers have employed state-of-the-art cyber-espionage tools on behalf of a foreign intelligence service that spies on human rights activists, journalists and political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews with nine former Raven operatives, along with a review of thousands of pages of project documents and emails, show that surveillance techniques taught by the NSA were central to the UAE’s efforts to monitor opponents. The sources interviewed by Reuters were not Emirati citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operatives utilized an arsenal of cyber tools, including a cutting-edge espionage platform known as Karma, in which Raven operatives say they hacked into the iPhones of hundreds of activists, political leaders and suspected terrorists. Details of the Karma hack were described in a separate Reuters article today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Raven. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. The UAE’s Embassy in Washington and a spokesman for its National Media Council did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAE has said it faces a real threat from violent extremist groups and that it is cooperating with the United States on counterterrorism efforts. Former Raven operatives say the project helped NESA break up an ISIS network within the Emirates. When an ISIS-inspired militant stabbed to death a teacher in Abu Dhabi in 2014, the operatives say, Raven spearheaded the UAE effort to assess if other attacks were imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various reports have highlighted the ongoing cyber arms race in the Middle East, as the Emirates and other nations attempt to sweep up hacking weapons and personnel faster than their rivals. The Reuters investigation is the first to reveal the existence of Project Raven, providing a rare inside account of state hacking operations usually shrouded in secrecy and denials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raven story also provides new insight into the role former American cyberspies play in foreign hacking operations. Within the U.S. intelligence community, leaving to work as an operative for another country is seen by some as a betrayal. “There’s a moral obligation if you’re a former intelligence officer from becoming effectively a mercenary for a foreign government,” said Bob Anderson, who served as executive assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this activity raises ethical dilemmas, U.S. national security lawyers say the laws guiding what American intelligence contractors can do abroad are murky. Though it’s illegal to share classified information, there is no specific law that bars contractors from sharing more general spycraft knowhow, such as how to bait a target with a virus-laden email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, however, are clear on hacking U.S. networks or stealing the communications of Americans. “It would be very illegal,” said Rhea Siers, former NSA deputy assistant director for policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacking of Americans was a tightly held secret even within Raven, with those operations led by Emiratis instead. Stroud’s account of the targeting of Americans was confirmed by four other former operatives and in emails reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI is now investigating whether Raven’s American staff leaked classified U.S. surveillance techniques and if they illegally targeted American computer networks, according to former Raven employees interviewed by federal law enforcement agents. Stroud said she is cooperating with that investigation. No charges have been filed and it is possible none will emerge from the inquiry. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PURPLE BRIEFING, BLACK BRIEFING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud is the only former Raven operative willing to be named in this story; eight others who described their experiences would do so only on condition of anonymity. She spent a decade at the NSA, first as a military service member from 2003 to 2009 and later as a contractor in the agency for the giant technology consultant Booz Allen Hamilton from 2009 to 2014. Her speciality was hunting for vulnerabilities in the computer systems of foreign governments, such as China, and analysing what data should be stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, her world changed. While stationed at NSA Hawaii, Stroud says, she made the fateful recommendation to bring a Dell technician already working in the building onto her team. That contractor was Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s former CIA, he’s local, he’s already cleared,” Stroud, 37, recalled. “He’s perfect!” Booz and the NSA would later approve Snowden’s transfer, providing him with even greater access to classified material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after joining Stroud’s group, Snowden fled the United States and passed on thousands of pages of top secret program files to journalists, detailing the agency’s massive data collection programs. In the maelstrom that followed, Stroud said her Booz team was vilified for unwittingly enabling the largest security breach in agency history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our brand was ruined,” she said of her team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the scandal, Marc Baier, a former colleague at NSA Hawaii, offered her the chance to work for a contractor in Abu Dhabi called CyberPoint. In May 2014, Stroud jumped at the opportunity and left Booz Allen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberPoint, a small cybersecurity contractor headquartered in Baltimore, was founded by an entrepreneur named Karl Gumtow in 2009. Its clients have included the U.S. Department of Defense, and its UAE business has gained media attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Gumtow said his company was not involved in any improper actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud had already made the switch from government employee to Booz Allen contractor, essentially performing the same NSA job at higher pay. Taking a job with CyberPoint would fulfil a lifelong dream of deploying to the Middle East and doing so at a lucrative salary. Many analysts, like Stroud, were paid more than $200,000 a year, and some managers received salaries and compensation above $400,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She understood her new job would involve a counterterrorism mission in cooperation with the Emiratis, a close U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS, but little else. Baier and other Raven managers assured her the project was approved by the NSA, she said. With Baier’s impressive resume, including time in an elite NSA hacking unit known as Tailored Access Operations, the pledge was convincing. Baier did not respond to multiple phone calls, text messages, emails, and messages on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the highly secretive, compartmentalized world of intelligence contracting, it isn’t unusual for recruiters to keep the mission and client from potential hires until they sign non-disclosure documents and go through a briefing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stroud was brought into the Villa for the first time, in May 2014, Raven management gave her two separate briefings, back-to-back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first, known internally as the “Purple briefing,” she said she was told Raven would pursue a purely defensive mission, protecting the government of the UAE from hackers and other threats. Right after the briefing ended, she said she was told she had just received a cover story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then received the “Black briefing,” a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. Raven is “the offensive, operational division of NESA and will never be acknowledged to the general public,” the Black memo says. The NESA, or National Electronic Security Authority, was the UAE’s version of the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud would be part of Raven’s analysis and target-development shop, tasked with helping the government profile its enemies online, hack them and collect data. Those targets were provided by the client, NESA, now called the Signals Intelligence Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language and secrecy of the briefings closely mirrored her experience at the NSA, Stroud said, giving her a level of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information scooped up by Raven was feeding a security apparatus that has drawn international criticism. The Emirates, a wealthy federation of seven Arab sheikhdoms with a population of 9 million, is an ally of neighbour Saudi Arabia and rival of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like those two regional powers, the UAE has been accused of suppressing free speech, detaining dissidents and other abuses by groups such as Human Rights Watch. The UAE says it is working closely with Washington to fight extremism “beyond the battlefield” and is promoting efforts to counter the “root causes” of radical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raven’s targets eventually would include militants in Yemen, foreign adversaries such as Iran, Qatar and Turkey, and individuals who criticized the monarchy, said Stroud and eight other former Raven operatives. Their accounts were confirmed by hundreds of Raven program documents reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under orders from the UAE government, former operatives said, Raven would monitor social media and target people who security forces felt had insulted the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some days it was hard to swallow, like [when you target] a 16-year-old kid on Twitter,” she said. “But it’s an intelligence mission, you are an intelligence operative. I never made it personal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Americans identified vulnerabilities in selected targets, developed or procured software to carry out the intrusions and assisted in monitoring them, former Raven employees said. But an Emirati operative would usually press the button on an attack. This arrangement was intended to give the Americans “plausible deniability” about the nature of the work, said former Raven members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TARGETING ‘GYRO’ AND ‘EGRET’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud discovered that the program took aim not just at terrorists and foreign government agencies, but also dissidents and human rights activists. The Emiratis categorized them as national security targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Arab Spring protests and the ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Emirati security forces viewed human rights advocates as a major threat to “national stability,” records and interviews show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the program’s key targets in 2012 was Rori Donaghy, according to former Raven operatives and program documents. Donaghy, then 25, was a British journalist and activist who authored articles critical of the country’s human rights record. In 2012, he wrote an opinion piece for the Guardian criticizing the UAE government’s activist crackdown and warning that, if it continued, “those in power face an uncertain future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2012, the former operatives said, the nascent UAE intelligence-gathering operation largely relied on Emirati agents breaking into the homes of targets while they were away and physically placing spyware on computers. But as the Americans built up Raven, the remote hacking of Donaghy offered the contractors a tantalizing win they could present to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of sensitivity over human rights violations and press freedom in the West, the operation against a journalist-activist was a gamble. “The potential risk to the UAE Government and diplomatic relations with Western powers is great if the operation can be traced back to UAE,” 2012 program documents said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get close to Donaghy, a Raven operative should attempt to “ingratiate himself to the target by espousing similar beliefs,” the cyber-mercenaries wrote. Donaghy would be “unable to resist an overture of this nature,” they believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posing as a single human rights activist, Raven operatives emailed Donaghy asking for his help to “bring hope to those who are long suffering,” the email message said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operative convinced Donaghy to download software he claimed would make messages “difficult to trace.” In reality, the malware allowed the Emiratis to continuously monitor Donaghy’s email account and Internet browsing. The surveillance against Donaghy, who was given the code name Gyro, continued under Stroud and remained a top priority for the Emirates for years, Stroud said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donaghy eventually became aware that his email had been hacked. In 2015, after receiving another suspicious email, he contacted a security researcher at Citizen Lab, a Canadian human rights and digital privacy group, who discovered hackers had been attempting for years to breach his computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached by phone in London, Donaghy, now a graduate student pursuing Arab studies, expressed surprise he was considered a top national security target for five years. Donaghy confirmed he was targeted using the techniques described in the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m glad my partner is sitting here as I talk on the phone because she wouldn’t believe it,” he said. Told the hackers were American mercenaries working for the UAE, Donaghy, a British citizen, expressed surprise and disgust. “It feels like a betrayal of the alliance we have,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud said her background as an intelligence operative made her comfortable with human rights targets as long as they weren’t Americans. “We’re working on behalf of this country’s government, and they have specific intelligence objectives which differ from the U.S., and understandably so,” Stroud said. “You live with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, given the code name Egret, was another target, former Raven operatives say. For years, Mansoor publicly criticized the country’s war in Yemen, treatment of migrant workers and detention of political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2013, Raven presented senior NESA officials with material taken from Mansoor’s computer, boasting of the successful collection of evidence against him. It contained screenshots of emails in which Mansoor discussed an upcoming demonstration in front of the UAE’s Federal Supreme Court with family members of imprisoned dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raven told UAE security forces Mansoor had photographed a prisoner he visited in jail, against prison policy, “and then attempted to destroy the evidence on his computer,” said a Powerpoint presentation reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen Lab published research in 2016 showing that Mansoor and Donaghy were targeted by hackers — with researchers speculating that the UAE government was the most likely culprit. Concrete evidence of who was responsible, details on the use of American operatives, and first-hand accounts from the hacking team are reported here for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansoor was convicted in a secret trial in 2017 of damaging the country’s unity and sentenced to 10 years in jail. He is now held in solitary confinement, his health declining, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mansoor’s wife, Nadia, has lived in social isolation in Abu Dhabi. Neighbours are avoiding her out of fear security forces are watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are correct. By June 2017 Raven had tapped into her mobile device and given her the code name Purple Egret, program documents reviewed by Reuters show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, Raven utilized a powerful new hacking tool called Karma, which allowed operatives to break into the iPhones of users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karma allowed Raven to obtain emails, location, text messages and photographs from iPhones simply by uploading lists of numbers into a preconfigured system, five former project employees said. Reuters had no contact with Mansoor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karma was particularly potent because it did not require a target to click on any link to download malicious software. The operatives understood the hacking tool to rely on an undisclosed vulnerability in Apple’s iMessage text messaging software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 and 2017, it would be used against hundreds of targets across the Middle East and Europe, including governments of Qatar, Yemen, Iran and Turkey, documents show. Raven used Karma to hack an iPhone used by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, as well as the phones of close associates and his brother. The embassy of Qatar in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT WASHINGTON KNEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Raven operatives believed they were on the right side of the law because, they said, supervisors told them the mission was blessed by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the NSA wasn’t involved in day-to-day operations, the agency approved of and was regularly briefed on Raven’s activities, they said Baier told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberPoint founder Gumtow said his company was not involved in hacking operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were not doing offensive operations. Period,” Gumtow said in a phone interview. “If someone was doing something rogue, then that’s painful for me to think they would do that under our banner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he said, the company trained Emiratis to defend themselves through a program with the country’s Ministry of Interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of internal Raven documents shows Gumtow’s description of the program as advising the Interior Ministry on cyber defence matches an “unclassified cover story” Raven operatives were instructed to give when asked about the project. Raven employees were told to say they worked for the Information Technology and Interoperability Office, the program document said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing sensitive defence technologies or services to a foreign government generally requires special licenses from the U.S. State and Commerce Departments. Both agencies declined to comment on whether they issued such licenses to CyberPoint for its operations in the UAE. They added that human rights considerations figure into any such approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a 2014 State Department agreement with CyberPoint showed Washington understood the contractors were helping launch cyber surveillance operations for the UAE. The approval document explains CyberPoint’s contract is to work alongside NESA in the “protection of UAE sovereignty” through “collection of information from communications systems inside and outside the UAE” and “surveillance analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One section of the State Department approval states CyberPoint must receive specific approval from the NSA before giving any presentations pertaining to “computer network exploitation or attack.” Reuters identified dozens of such presentations Raven gave to NESA describing attacks against Donaghy, Mansoor and others. It’s unclear whether the NSA approved Raven’s operations against specific targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement clearly forbade CyberPoint employees from targeting American citizens or companies. As part of the agreement, CyberPoint promised that its own staff and even Emirati personnel supporting the program “will not be used to Exploit U.S. Persons, (i.e. U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or U.S. companies.)” Sharing classified U.S. information, controlled military technology, or the intelligence collection methods of U.S. agencies was also prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gumtow declined to discuss the specifics of the agreement. “To the best of my ability and to the best of my knowledge, we did everything as requested when it came to U.S. rules and regulations,” he said. “And we provided a mechanism for people to come to me if they thought that something that was done was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Project Raven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A State Department spokesman declined to comment on the agreement but said such licenses do not authorize people to engage in human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late 2015, some Raven operatives said their missions became more audacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, instead of being asked to hack into individual users of an Islamist Internet forum, as before, the American contractors were called on to create computer viruses that would infect every person visiting a flagged site. Such wholesale collection efforts risked sweeping in the communications of American citizens, stepping over a line the operators knew well from their NSA days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. law generally forbids the NSA, CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies from monitoring U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working together with managers, Stroud helped create a policy for what to do when Raven swept up personal data belonging to Americans. The former NSA employees were instructed to mark that material for deletion. Other Raven operatives would also be notified so the American victims could be removed from future collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, Stroud noticed American data flagged for removal show up again and again in Raven’s NESA-controlled data stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, she found the work exhilarating. “It was incredible because there weren’t these limitations like there was at the NSA. There wasn’t that bullshit red tape,” she said. “I feel like we did a lot of good work on counterterrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DARKMATTER AND DEPARTURES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Raven was created in 2009, Abu Dhabi had little cyber expertise. The original idea was for Americans to develop and run the program for five to 10 years until Emirati intelligence officers were skilled enough to take over, documents show. By 2013, the American contingent at Raven numbered between a dozen and 20 members at any time, accounting for the majority of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2015, the power dynamic at the Villa shifted as the UAE grew more uncomfortable with a core national security program being controlled by foreigners, former staff said. Emirati defence officials told Gumtow they wanted Project Raven to be run through a domestic company, named DarkMatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raven’s American creators were given two options: Join DarkMatter or go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least eight operatives left Raven during this transition period. Some said they left after feeling unsettled about the vague explanations Raven managers provided when pressed on potential surveillance against other Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DarkMatter was founded in 2014 by Faisal Al Bannai, who also created Axiom, one of the largest sellers of mobile devices in the region. DarkMatter markets itself as an innovative developer of defensive cyber technology. A 2016 Intercept article reported the company assisted UAE’s security forces in surveillance efforts and was attempting to recruit foreign cyber experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emirati company of more than 650 employees publicly acknowledges its close business relationship to the UAE government, but denies involvement in state-backed hacking efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Raven’s true purpose was kept secret from most executives at DarkMatter, former operatives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DarkMatter did not respond to requests for comment. Al Bannai and the company’s current chief executive, Karim Sabbagh, did not respond to interview requests. A spokeswoman for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under DarkMatter, Project Raven continued to operate in Abu Dhabi from the Villa, but pressure escalated for the program to become more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, senior NESA officers were given more control over daily functions, former Raven operatives said, often leaving American managers out of the loop. By mid-2016, the Emirates had begun making an increasing number of sections of Raven hidden from the Americans still managing day-to-day operations. Soon, an “Emirate-eyes only” designation appeared for some hacking targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FBI QUESTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2016, FBI agents began approaching DarkMatter employees reentering the United States to ask about Project Raven, three former operatives said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI wanted to know: Had they been asked to spy on Americans? Did classified information on U.S. intelligence collection techniques and technologies end up in the hands of the Emiratis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two agents approached Stroud in 2016 at Virginia’s Dulles airport as she was returning to the UAE after a trip home. Stroud, afraid she might be under surveillance by the UAE herself, said she brushed off the FBI investigators. “I’m not telling you guys jack,” she recounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud had been promoted and given even more access to internal Raven databases the previous year. A lead analyst, her job was to probe the accounts of potential Raven targets and learn what vulnerabilities could be used to penetrate their email or messaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets were listed in various categories, by country. Yemeni targets were in the “brown category,” for example. Iran was grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning in spring 2017, after she finished her own list of targets, Stroud said she began working on a backlog of other assignments intended for a NESA officer. She noticed that a passport page of an American was in the system. When Stroud emailed supervisors to complain, she was told the data had been collected by mistake and would be deleted, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerned, Stroud began searching a targeting request list usually limited to Raven’s Emirati staff, which she was still able to access because of her role as lead analyst. She saw that security forces had sought surveillance against two other Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she questioned the apparent targeting of Americans, she received a rebuke from an Emirati colleague for accessing the targeting list, the emails show. The target requests she viewed were to be processed by “certain people. You are not one of them,” the Emirati officer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days later, Stroud said she came upon three more American names on the hidden targeting queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those names were in a category she hadn’t seen before: the “white category” — for Americans. This time, she said, the occupations were listed: journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was sick to my stomach,” she said. “It kind of hit me at that macro level realizing there was a whole category for U.S. persons on this program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, she said she turned to manager Baier. He attempted to downplay the concern and asked her to drop the issue, she said. But he also indicated that any targeting of Americans was supposed to be done by Raven’s Emirate staff, said Stroud and two other people familiar with the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroud’s account of the incidents was confirmed by four other former employees and emails reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Slideshow &lt;span class=&quot;Slideshow_count&quot;&gt;(13 Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stroud kept raising questions, she said, she was put on leave by superiors, her phones and passport were taken, and she was escorted from the building. Stroud said it all happened so quickly she was unable to recall the names of the three U.S. journalists or other Americans she came across in the files. “I felt like one of those national security targets,” she said. “I’m stuck in the country, I’m being surveilled, I can’t leave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two months, Stroud was allowed to return to America. Soon after, she fished out the business card of the FBI agents who had confronted her at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think Americans should be doing this to other Americans,” she told Reuters. “I’m a spy, I get that. I’m an intelligence officer, but I’m not a bad one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;07ad&quot; id=&quot;07ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;This is deep, albeit short, so let’s dive in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;06e5&quot; id=&quot;06e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Write tests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7468&quot; id=&quot;7468&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;Yes, for most projects you should write automated tests. You should if you value your time anyway. Much better to catch a bug locally from the tests than getting a call at 2:00 in the morning and fix it then. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Often I find myself saving time when I put time in to write tests.&lt;/strong&gt; It may or may not take longer to implement what I’m building, but I (and others) will almost definitely save time maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;224b&quot; id=&quot;224b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The thing you should be thinking about when writing tests is how much confidence they bring you that your project is free of bugs. Static typing and linting tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://flow.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt; can get you a remarkable amount of confidence, and if you’re not using these tools I highly suggest you give them a look. That said, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;even a strongly typed language should have tests.&lt;/strong&gt; Typing and linting can’t ensure your business logic is free of bugs. So you can still seriously increase your confidence with a good test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;a566&quot; id=&quot;a566&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Not too many.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c20a&quot; id=&quot;c20a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;I’ve heard managers and teams mandating 100% code coverage for applications. That’s a really bad idea. The problem is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;you get diminishing returns on your tests as the coverage increases much beyond 70%&lt;/strong&gt; (I made that number up… no science there). Why is that? Well, when you strive for 100% all the time, you find yourself spending time testing things that really don’t need to be tested. Things that really have no logic in them at all (so any bugs could be caught by ESLint and Flow). &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Maintaining tests like this actually really slow you and your team down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;65d6&quot; id=&quot;65d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You may also find yourself testing implementation details just so you can make sure you get that one line of code that’s hard to reproduce in a test environment. You &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to avoid testing implementation details because it doesn’t give you very much confidence that your application is working and it slows you down when refactoring. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;You should very rarely have to change tests when you refactor code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aaa5&quot; id=&quot;aaa5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I should mention that almost all of my open source projects have 100% code coverage. This is because most of my open source projects are smaller libraries and tools that are reusable in many different situations (a breakage could lead to a serious problem in a lot of consuming projects) and they’re relatively easy to get 100% code coverage on anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;b7ba&quot; id=&quot;b7ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Mostly integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7d9f&quot; id=&quot;7d9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;There are all sorts of different types of testing (check out my 5 minute talk about it at Fluent Conf: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da9wfQ0frGA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da9wfQ0frGA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“What we can learn about testing from the wheel”&lt;/a&gt;). They each have trade-offs. The three most common forms of testing we’re talking about when we talk of automated testing are: Unit, Integration, and End to End.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;11af&quot; id=&quot;11af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop#/4/8&quot; data-href=&quot;http://slides.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop#/4/8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a slide&lt;/a&gt; from my Frontend Masters workshop: &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-javascript/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-javascript/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Testing JavaScript Applications”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

testing pyramid
&lt;p name=&quot;e08e&quot; id=&quot;e08e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This testing pyramid is a combination of one I got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin Fowler’s blog&lt;/a&gt; and one I got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Google Testing blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c3a&quot; id=&quot;0c3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As indicated here, the pyramid shows from bottom to top: Unit, Integration, E2E. As you move up the pyramid the tests get slower to write/run and more expensive (in terms of time and resources) to run/maintain. It’s meant to indicate that you should spend more of your time on unit tests due to these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7065&quot; id=&quot;7065&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One thing that it doesn’t show though is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;as you move up the pyramid, the confidence quotient of each form of testing increases.&lt;/strong&gt; You get more bang for your buck. So while E2E tests may be slower and more expensive than unit tests, they bring you much more confidence that your application is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0610&quot; id=&quot;0610&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is why I created “The Testing Trophy” 🏆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5667&quot; id=&quot;5667&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/628658648001048577&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/628658648001048577&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;My all-time most retweeted tweet&lt;/a&gt; has to do with the main issue with unit tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;db65&quot; id=&quot;db65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Still love this one. Unit testers be like: “Looks like it’s working”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*eCs8GoVZVksoQtQx.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;480&quot; data-height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*eCs8GoVZVksoQtQx.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Man in three pieces. Legs running in place. Torso doing push-ups. Head reading.
&lt;p name=&quot;e4e9&quot; id=&quot;e4e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We’ve written unit tests that verify the man can run in place, do pushups, and read, but the man isn’t integrating with his various body parts very effectively. It doesn’t matter if your button component calls the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; handler if that handler doesn't make the right request with the right data! So while having some unit tests to verify these pieces work in isolation isn’t a bad thing, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;it doesn’t do you any good if you don’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;also&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;verify that they work together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c4f3&quot; id=&quot;c4f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Integration tests strike a great balance on the trade-offs between confidence and speed/expense.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why it’s advisable to spend &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; (not all, mind you) of your effort there.&lt;/p&gt;
