&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use k3s?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;grid-three&quot; readability=&quot;11.453793103448&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Optimized for ARM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ARM64 and ARMv7 are supported with binaries and multiarch images available for both. k3s works great from something as small as a Raspberry Pi or as large as an AWS a1.4xlarge 32GiB server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Simplified Operations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k3s is wrapped in a simple package that reduces the dependencies and steps needed to run a production Kubernetes cluster. Packaged as a single binary, k3s makes installation and upgrade as simple as copying a file. TLS certificates are automatically generated to ensure that all communication is secure by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; readability=&quot;8.1142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Perfect for Edge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K3s is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/&quot;&gt;Certified Kubernetes distribution&lt;/a&gt; designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;bg-light&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;grid-two wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;k3s is a fully compliant production-grade Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://k3s.io/img/certified-kubernetes.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy, alpha, non-default features are removed. Many of these features are not available in most Kubernetes clusters already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed in-tree plugins (cloud providers and storage plugins) which can be replaced with out-of-tree add-ons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sqlite3 as the default storage mechanism. etcd3 is still available, but not the default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrapped in a simple launcher that handles a lot of the complexity of TLS and options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Minimum System Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux 3.10+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;512 MB of ram per server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75 MB of ram per node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200 MB of disk space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x86_64, ARMv7, ARM64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;black-white&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;black&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is literally a greener place than it was 20 years ago, and the data from NASA satellites has revealed a counterintuitive source for much of this new foliage: China and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprising new study shows that the two emerging countries with the world’s biggest populations are leading the improvement in greening on land. The effect stems mainly from ambitious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/china-reassigning-60000-troops-plant-trees/&quot;&gt;tree planting programs in China&lt;/a&gt; and intensive agriculture in both countries. In 2017 alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/india-plants-record-breaking-66-million-trees-12-hours/&quot;&gt;India broke its own world record&lt;/a&gt; for the most trees planted after volunteers gathered to plant 66 million saplings in just 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greening phenomenon was first detected by researchers using satellite data in the mid-1990s, but they did not know whether human activity was one of its chief, direct causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new insight was made possible by a nearly 20-year-long data record from a NASA instrument orbiting the Earth on two satellites. It’s called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS, and its high-resolution data provides very accurate information, helping researchers work out details of what’s happening with Earth’s vegetation, down to the level of 500 meters, or about 1,600 feet, on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title=&quot;Island on the Brink of Disaster Plants Thousands of Trees and is Now a Poster Kid for Adapting to Climate Change&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/kokota-island-adapts-to-climate-change-by-planting-thousands-of-trees/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;Island on the Brink of Disaster Plants Thousands of Trees and is Now a Poster Kid for Adapting to Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, the greening of the planet over the last two decades represents an increase in leaf area on plants and trees equivalent to the area covered by all the Amazon rainforests. There are now more than two million square miles of extra green leaf area per year, compared to the early 2000s – which amounts to a 5% increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China and India account for one-third of the greening, but contain only 9% of the planet’s land area covered in vegetation – a surprising finding, considering the general notion of land degradation in populous countries from overexploitation,” said Chi Chen of the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title=&quot;People Have Passively Planted Over 30 Million Trees Simply by Surfing the Web&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/people-have-passively-planted-over-30-million-trees-simply-by-surfing-the-web/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;People Have Passively Planted Over 30 Million Trees Simply by Surfing the Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of the MODIS satellite sensor is the intensive coverage it provides, both in space and time: MODIS has captured as many as four shots of every place on Earth, every day for the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This long-term data lets us dig deeper,” said Rama Nemani, a research scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center and a co-author of the new work. “When the greening of the Earth was first observed, we thought it was due to a warmer, wetter climate and fertilization from the added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to more leaf growth in northern forests, for instance. Now, with the MODIS data that lets us understand the phenomenon at really small scales, we see that humans are also contributing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tag/china/&quot;&gt;China’s&lt;/a&gt; outsized contribution to the global greening trend comes in large part (42%) from programs to conserve and expand forests. These were developed in an effort to reduce the effects of soil erosion, air pollution and climate change. Another 32% there – and 82% of the greening seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tag/india/&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; – comes from intensive cultivation of food crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title=&quot;German 12-Year-old Boy Plants 1Million Trees, Takes Over UN Program to Plant a Trillion More&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/german-12-year-old-boy-plants-1million-trees-takes-over-un-program-to-plant-a-trillion-more/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;German 12-Year-old Boy Plants 1Million Trees, Takes Over UN Program to Plant a Trillion More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land area used to grow crops – more than 770,000 square miles – is comparable in China and India and it has not changed much since the early 2000s; yet these regions have greatly increased both their annual total green leaf area and their food production. This was achieved through multiple cropping practices, where a field is replanted to produce another harvest several times a year. Production of grains, vegetables, fruits, and more have increased by about 35-40% since 2000 to feed their large populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the greening trend may change in the future depends on numerous factors, both on a global scale and the local human level. For example, increased food production in India is facilitated by groundwater irrigation. If the groundwater is depleted, this trend may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But, now that we know direct human influence is a key driver of the greening Earth, we need to factor this into our climate models,” Nemani said. “This will help scientists make better predictions about the behavior of different Earth systems, which will help countries make better decisions about how and when to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title=&quot;700 Acres of Massive 1,000-Year-old Redwoods Are Being Turned into a Public Park&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/700-acres-of-massive-1000-year-old-redwoods-are-being-turned-into-a-public-park/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;700 Acres of Massive 1,000-Year-old Redwoods Are Being Turned into a Public Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that the gain in greenness seen around the world, which is dominated by India and China, does not offset the damage from loss of natural vegetation in tropical regions, such as Brazil and Indonesia. The consequences for sustainability and biodiversity in those ecosystems remain, but overall, Nemani sees a positive message in the new findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once people realize there’s a problem, they tend to fix it,” he said. “In the 70s and 80s in India and China, the situation around vegetation loss wasn’t good; in the 90s, people realized it; and today things have improved. Humans are incredibly resilient. That’s what we see in the satellite data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published online this week in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0220-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=494649&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, its creator Salvatore Sanfilippo (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/news/127&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;antirez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) says “one of the major points of Redis is to support more complex types as values”. From Day 1, Salvatore knew what he wanted to build. And to his credit,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/one-year-of-redis.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;he stayed focused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Redis now has 10 complex types and a module system that enables developers to build more. And as a result, Redis is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/key-value+store&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the most popular key-value store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Salvatore could not have done this alone. Someone had to be the first to share the link, and someone had to be the first to try the software. That first post was shared by David Welton (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=davidw&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;davidw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). I have no idea if he tried the software, or just thought it seemed cool, but he took a risk and shared it on Hacker News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only five people commented on that first post: three promoted alternative data stores; one suggested Salvatore re-write Redis in Erlang; and one, JUST ONE, offered some help. That one person turned out to be Ezra Zygmuntowicz (a.k.a.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ezmobius&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ezmobius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.newrelic.com/culture/ezra-zygmuntowicz/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), a very popular Ruby on Rails (RoR) developer and one of the founders of Engine Yard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ezra not only encouraged Salvatore, but implemented the first Ruby client library for Redis. Then he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ezmobius/status/1252368007&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweeted about it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which spread the word to the Rails community  At the time, RoR was helping developers create beautiful websites, but users of the framework struggled to make it scale. Thanks to Ezra’s efforts, Redis spread among RoR developers, and helped thousands of RoR websites scale. One of those websites was Twitter. Eventually, Redis went on to be a wildly popular add-on for Heroku developers, and then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://redis.io/clients&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;many, many others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were others after David and Ezra. But, as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Derek Sivers says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “It takes guts to be a first follower. You stand out, you brave ridiculing yourself. Being a first follower is an underappreciated form of leadership”. Nine years ago,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/one-year-of-redis.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salvatore said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Your early adopters are not brave because they are irresponsible, just they can evaluate something without the need to follow the mass”. So thanks to Salvatore, David and Ezra, and other early risk takers, an open source community called Redis was born. And to those first adopters of the Redis community, as we turn 10 years old today, we say thank you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Join us as we celebrate 10 years of Redis at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redislabs.com/redisconf19/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RedisConf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the yearly gathering of Redis developers, implementers and other community members. This year it takes place April 2-3 on Pier 27 in San Francisco. Perhaps you’ll find something new that will inspire you to take a risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Redis Turns 10 - How it started with a single post on Hacker News | Redis Labs</og:title>
<og:description>Redis Labs, the home of Redis and provider of Redis Enterprise, announced that Redis is marking a major milestone. 10 years ago Redis was born when a link was posted on Hacker News to a new software project called Redis by creator Salvatore Sanfilippo (a.k.a. antirez).</og:description>

&lt;h2&gt;One-Step Automated Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Install Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Piping to &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; is controversial&lt;/a&gt;, as it prevents you from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh&quot;&gt;reading code that is about to run&lt;/a&gt; on your system. Therefore, we provide these alternative installation methods which allow code review before installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 1: Clone our repository and run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
cd &quot;Pi-hole/automated install/&quot;
sudo bash basic-install.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method 2: Manually download the installer and run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
sudo bash basic-install.sh
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-install: Make your network take advantage of Pi-hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the installer has been run, you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-configure-my-devices-to-use-pi-hole-as-their-dns-server/245&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;configure your router to have &lt;strong&gt;DHCP clients use Pi-hole as their DNS server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which ensures that all devices connecting to your network will have content blocked without any further intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your router does not support setting the DNS server, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-use-pi-holes-built-in-dhcp-server-and-why-would-i-want-to/3026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;use Pi-hole's built-in DHCP server&lt;/a&gt;; just be sure to disable DHCP on your router first (if it has that feature available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, you can always manually set each device to use Pi-hole as their DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pi-hole is free, but powered by your support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reoccurring costs involved with maintaining free, open source, and privacy-respecting software; expenses which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people&quot;&gt;our volunteer developers&lt;/a&gt; pitch in to cover out-of-pocket. This is just one example of how strongly we feel about our software, as well as the importance of keeping it maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: &lt;strong&gt;your support is absolutely vital to help keep us innovating!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Donations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending a donation using our links below is &lt;strong&gt;extremely helpful&lt;/strong&gt; in offsetting a portion of our monthly expenses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd rather not &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/donate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which is okay!&lt;/em&gt;), there are other ways you can help support us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contributing via GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to contribute to issue reports, suggest new features, and create pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have something to add - anything from a typo through to a whole new feature, we're happy to check it out! Just make sure to fill out our template when submitting your request; the questions that it asks will help the volunteers quickly understand what you're aiming to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh&quot;&gt;install script&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/piholeDebug.sh&quot;&gt;debug script&lt;/a&gt; have an abundance of comments, which will help you better understand how Pi-hole works. They're also a valuable resource to those who want to learn how to write scripts or code a program! We encourage anyone who likes to tinker to read through it and submit a pull request for us to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presentations about Pi-hole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word-of-mouth continues to help our project grow immensely, and so we are helping make this easier for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be presenting Pi-hole at a conference, meetup or even a school project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/2017/05/17/giving-a-presentation-on-pi-hole-contact-us-first-for-some-goodies-and-support/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;get in touch with us&lt;/a&gt; so we can hook you up with free swag to hand out to your audience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting in touch with us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are primarily reachable on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discourse User Forum&lt;/a&gt;, we can also be found on a variety of social media outlets. &lt;strong&gt;Please be sure to check the FAQ's&lt;/strong&gt; before starting a new discussion, as we do not have the spare time to reply to every request for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Breakdown of Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Command Line Interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pihole&lt;/code&gt; command has all the functionality necessary to be able to fully administer the Pi-hole, without the need of the Web Interface. It's fast, user-friendly, and auditable by anyone with an understanding of &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/blacklist-cli.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/57f15d9665575a98275d3511f8f591863733b8c0/68747470733a2f2f70692d686f6c652e6769746875622e696f2f67726170686963732f53637265656e73686f74732f626c61636b6c6973742d636c692e676966&quot; alt=&quot;Pi-hole Blacklist Demo&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/blacklist-cli.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Core-Function-Breakdown&quot;&gt;Core Feature Breakdown&lt;/a&gt;, as well as read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/the-pihole-command-with-examples/738&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;example usage&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Web Interface Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE&quot;&gt;optional dashboard&lt;/a&gt; allows you to view stats, change settings, and configure your Pi-hole. It's the power of the Command Line Interface, with none of the learning curve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/732bd6d32141d492f987d9f0940d900fba5b4443/68747470733a2f2f70692d686f6c652e6769746875622e696f2f67726170686963732f53637265656e73686f74732f7069686f6c652d64617368626f6172642e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/732bd6d32141d492f987d9f0940d900fba5b4443/68747470733a2f2f70692d686f6c652e6769746875622e696f2f67726170686963732f53637265656e73686f74732f7069686f6c652d64617368626f6172642e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;Pi-hole Dashboard&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/pihole-dashboard.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed graphs and doughnut charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top lists of domains and clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A filterable and sortable query log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Term Statistics to view data over user-defined time ranges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to easily manage and configure Pi-hole features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... and all the main features of the Command Line Interface!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-access-pi-holes-dashboard-admin-interface/3168&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;access the dashboard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;IP_ADDPRESS_OF_YOUR_PI_HOLE&amp;gt;/admin/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://pi.hole/admin/&lt;/code&gt; (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://pi.hole/&lt;/code&gt; (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Faster-than-light Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTLDNS is a lightweight, purpose-built daemon used to provide statistics needed for the Web Interface, and its API can be easily integrated into your own projects. As the name implies, FTLDNS does this all &lt;em&gt;very quickly&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the statistics you can integrate include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total number of domains being blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of DNS queries today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total number of ads blocked today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of ads blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries forwarded (to your chosen upstream DNS server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queries cached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The API can be accessed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Web (&lt;code&gt;admin/api.php&lt;/code&gt;) and Command Line (&lt;code&gt;pihole -c -j&lt;/code&gt;). You can out find &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;more details over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Origin Of Pi-hole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pi-hole being an &lt;strong&gt;advertising-aware DNS/Web server&lt;/strong&gt;, makes use of the following technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - a lightweight DNS and DHCP server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lighttpd.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lighttpd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - web server designed and optimized for high performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.php.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - a popular general-purpose web scripting language&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While quite outdated at this point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacobsalmela.com/2015/06/16/block-millions-ads-network-wide-with-a-raspberry-pi-hole-2-0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this original blog post about Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; goes into &lt;strong&gt;great detail&lt;/strong&gt; about how Pi-hole was originally set up and how it works. Syntactically, it's no longer accurate, but the same basic principles and logic still apply to Pi-hole's current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/07/usb-3-2-will-make-your-cables-twice-as-fast-once-youve-bought-new-devices/&quot;&gt;USB 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, which doubles the maximum speed of a USB connection to 20Gb/s, is likely to materialize in systems later this year. In preparation for this, the USB-IF—the industry group that together develops the various USB specifications—has announced the branding and naming that the new revision is going to use, and... it's awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB 3.0 was straightforward enough. A USB 3.0 connection ran at 5Gb/s, and slower connections were USB 2 or even USB 1.1. The new 5Gb/s data rate was branded &quot;SuperSpeed USB,&quot; following USB 2's 480Mb/s &quot;High Speed&quot; and USB 1.1's 12Mb/s &quot;Full Speed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then USB 3.1 came along and muddied the waters. Its big new feature was doubling the data rate to 10Gb/s. The logical thing would have been to identify existing 5Gb/s devices as &quot;USB 3.0&quot; and new 10Gb/s devices as &quot;USB 3.1.&quot; But that's not what the USB-IF did. For reasons that remain hard to understand, the decision was made to retroactively rebrand USB 3.0: 5Gb/s 3.0 connections became &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 1,&quot; with the 10Gb/s connections being &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 2.&quot; The consumer branding is &quot;SuperSpeed USB 10Gbps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this branding meant is that many manufacturers say that a device supports &quot;USB 3.1&quot; even if it's only a &quot;USB 3.1 Gen 1&quot; device running at 5Gb/s. Meanwhile, other manufacturers do the sensible thing: they use &quot;USB 3.0&quot; to denote 5Gb/s devices and reserve &quot;USB 3.1&quot; for 10Gb/s parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB 3.2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usb_3_2_language_product_and_packaging_guidelines_final.pdf&quot;&gt;doubles down on this confusion&lt;/a&gt;. 5Gb/s devices are now &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1.&quot; 10Gb/s devices become &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2.&quot; And 20Gb/s devices will be... &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2×2.&quot; Because they work by running two 10Gb/s connections along different pairs of wires simultaneously, and it's just obvious from arithmetic that you'd number the generations &quot;1, 2, 2×2.&quot; Perhaps they're named for powers of two, starting with zero? The consumer branding is a more reasonable &quot;SuperSpeed USB 20Gbps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good part of all this is that USB 3.2 could mean 5, 10, or 20Gbps. You can bet that there will be manufacturers who are going to exploit that confusion wherever and whenever they can.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California keeps a secret list of criminal cops, but says you can’t have it</title>
<link>https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/02/26/california-keeps-a-secret-list-of-criminal-cops-but-says-you-cant-have-it/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/02/26/california-keeps-a-secret-list-of-criminal-cops-but-says-you-cant-have-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Their crimes ranged from shoplifting to embezzlement to murder. Some of them molested kids and downloaded child pornography. Others beat their wives, girlfriends or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing they had in common: a badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of California law enforcement officers have been convicted of a crime in the past decade, according to records released by a public agency that sets standards for officers in the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations are alarming, but the state’s top cop says Californians don’t have a right to see them. In fact, Attorney General Xavier Becerra warned two Berkeley-based reporters that simply possessing this never-before-publicly-released list of convicted cops is a violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training — known as POST — provided the information last month in response to routine Public Records Act requests from reporters for the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley and its production arm, Investigative Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazyautosizes lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-k-becerra-04xx-5.jpg?fit=310%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 310w&quot;/&gt;California Attorney General Xavier Becerra responds to questions from the Bay Area News Group’s Opinion and Editorial Board during an interview at the San Jose Mercury News office on Monday, April 16, 2018. Becerra is seeking re-election to the Attorney General’s office. (Michael Malone/Bay Area News Group) 
&lt;p&gt;But when Becerra’s office learned about the disclosure, it threatened the reporters with legal action unless they destroyed the records, insisting they are confidential under state law and were released inadvertently. The two journalism organizations have rejected Becerra’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s disheartening and ominous that the highest law enforcement officer in the state is threatening legal action over something the First Amendment makes clear can’t give rise to criminal action against a reporter,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a San Rafael-based nonprofit that advocates for free speech and open records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents provide a rare glimpse at the volume of officer misconduct at a time of heightened interest over police accountability. The list includes cops who trafficked drugs, cops who stole money from their departments and even one who robbed a bank wearing a fake beard. Some sexually assaulted suspects. Others took bribes, filed false reports and committed perjury. A large number drove under the influence of drugs and alcohol — sometimes killing people on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berkeley journalists chose not to publish the entire list until they could spend more time reporting to avoid misidentifying people among the nearly 12,000 names in the documents, said John Temple, director of the Investigative Reporting Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the details are stunning in a state where officials have fought for years to keep virtually any record of police misconduct a secret. And they come amid a larger battle playing out in courtrooms throughout the state over California’s new police transparency law, Senate Bill 1421. Law enforcement groups have sued to limit the impact of that law, claiming it shouldn’t expose police disciplinary records created before the law took effect on Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becerra himself has rejected public records requests from his own agency, and he is now being sued by a prominent First Amendment group for failing to comply. Many other agencies in California have followed the attorney general’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you disclose a document that’s confidential and private, you can’t take it back,” Becerra told reporters earlier this month. ”You don’t get a second chance to get it right, you got to get it right the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that law has garnered the most attention and a public fight over police disciplinary records, it was another law that took effect Jan. 1 that led to the disclosure of the convictions of thousands of law enforcement officers and applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The secret list&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked into a public safety omnibus bill last year was a provision allowing the state’s Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to keep information in its records showing when a current or former law enforcement officer is convicted of a felony or other crime that would disqualify them from being a cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police departments often check POST’s records as part of the routine background check process when hiring new officers. But until the law changed, POST only labeled someone as being disqualified from serving in law enforcement when the person was convicted and had exhausted all appeals — which could take years and was difficult to track. The new law allows them to disqualify someone after a conviction, according to a POST spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the start of this year, Becerra’s office provided POST for the first time a list of what the agency says are convictions of current and former law enforcement officers and people who at one time had tried to become a cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST provided 10 years’ worth of convictions — nearly 12,000 names in all — to the Berkeley-based investigative reporting organizations in early January in response to a public records request. Three weeks later the AG’s office sent a letter saying the records were “inadvertently” released and were considered confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Becerra’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nic Marais, an attorney with Keker, Van Nest &amp;amp; Peters representing Investigative Studios, said the state’s assertions that the documents had been released “inadvertently” was hard to believe given that POST spent four weeks weighing the reporters’ request. In a letter to the AG, Marais wrote that because the documents appear to be a summary of public records, the disclosure exemptions cited by POST and Attorney General Becerra’s Office do not apply. Finally, he wrote that state law exempts reporters from prosecution for receiving records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder, of the First Amendment Coalition, argued the underlying records are in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Police officers are vested by the public with extraordinary power,” he said. “In order to monitor the use of that power, the public needs to know when they are over the line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But attorney Mike Rains, who represents police officers, questions why they should be singled out by such a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To the extent the public wants that to be public record, I can understand that,” said Rains, who is leading a legal fight to block the release of officer disciplinary records under the new law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t we make that known for everybody?” Rains said of convictions, pointing out there’s no broad disclosure for lawyers, doctors, teachers and other trusted professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What the conviction list reveals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the indiscretions in the new documents released last month to the Berkeley investigative reporting organizations have never been revealed publicly until now. Some of the officers were fired from the force only after an arrest. Others remain on the job despite a criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3,500 names on the list appear to match the names of police officers in state personnel databases, and about 2,250 of those have been on the force within the last five years. But without more information, the exact breakdown of which individuals were in law enforcement as opposed to applicants to become an officer is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Caporale, a spokesman for POST, said his agency is using the list to check if active officers have committed crimes that should prevent them from working in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s that potential. That’s what we’re trying to eliminate … to make sure no one out there is a peace officer today who shouldn’t be,” Caporale said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also is on the lookout for former cops with convictions who try to get back into law enforcement, he said. “We want to make sure those folks don’t slip through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Jeong is on the list. He was an Emeryville police officer for a few months but failed his field training program. So he went to work as a dispatcher for the department. In August 2017, Jeong claimed to be a cop in order to buy a gun and three high capacity magazines in San Jose, according to court records. He was ultimately convicted of impersonating a police officer. Jeong declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Hayward police officer Joshua Cannon also is on the list. In October 2010, Cannon was arrested for driving drunk in Alameda County with blood alcohol nearly twice the legal limit. A CHP officer clocked him going 92 mph, and when the officer tried to pull him over, Cannon quickly pulled off the highway and down a sidestreet, court records show.
&lt;p&gt;Cannon eventually stopped and told the CHP officer that he was a cop and carrying an off-duty weapon. According to the CHP officer, Cannon “started asking me for a ‘break,’” the report said. “He also asked me that if I was in his situation what would I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon was convicted of misdemeanor driving under the influence — and remains on the force. He declined to comment for this story, citing department rules against talking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list also included a new revelation about a San Francisco police sergeant who had been the subject of numerous media reports for use-of-force complaints and shootings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Sgt. John Haggett was accused of helping a girlfriend dig up dirt on tenants. Internal Affairs started investigating after one of them claimed Haggett’s girlfriend made a disturbing threat: “My boyfriend is a police officer and will take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haggett, who is now retired, pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor for accessing the confidential information. He did not respond to an interview request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FTC Brings First Case Challenging Fake Paid Reviews on an Indie Retail Website</title>
<link>https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-brings-first-case-challenging-fake-paid-reviews-independent</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-brings-first-case-challenging-fake-paid-reviews-independent</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission today announced its first case challenging a marketer’s use of fake paid reviews on an independent retail website. In settling the agency’s complaint, Cure Encapsulations, Inc. and its owner, Naftula Jacobowitz, resolved allegations that they made false and unsubstantiated claims for their garcinia cambogia weight-loss supplement and that they paid a third-party website to write and post fake reviews on Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People rely on reviews when they’re shopping online,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “When a company buys fake reviews to inflate its Amazon ratings, it hurts both shoppers and companies that play by the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the FTC Did to Protect Consumers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_complaint_2-26-19.pdf&quot;&gt;FTC’s complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the defendants advertised and sold “Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia Extract with HCA” capsules on Amazon.com as an appetite-suppressing, fat-blocking, weight-loss pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC alleges that the defendants paid a website, amazonverifiedreviews.com, to create and post Amazon reviews of their product. The FTC contends that Jacobowitz told the website’s operator that his product needed to have an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars in order to have sales and to, “Please make my product … stay a five star.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the FTC’s complaint, the reviews the defendants bought were posted on Amazon.com and gave the product a five-star rating. The complaint charges the defendants with representing that the purchased Amazon reviews were truthful reviews written by actual purchasers, when in reality they were fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC’s complaint also alleges that the defendants made false and unsubstantiated claims on their Amazon product page, including through the purchased reviews, that their garcinia cambogia product is a “powerful appetite suppressant,” “Literally BLOCKS FAT From Forming,” causes significant weight loss, including as much as twenty pounds, and causes rapid and substantial weight loss, including as much as two or more pounds per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Settlement Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/quality_encapsulations_proposed_order_2-26-19.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed court order settling the FTC’s complaint&lt;/a&gt; prohibits the defendants from making weight-loss, appetite-suppression, fat-blocking, or disease-treatment claims for any dietary supplement, food, or drug unless they have competent and reliable scientific evidence in the form of human clinical testing supporting the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order also requires the defendants to have competent and reliable scientific evidence to support any other claims about the health benefits or efficacy of such products. In addition, it prohibits them from making misrepresentations regarding endorsements, including that an endorsement is truthful or by an actual user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order next requires the defendants to email notices to consumers who bought Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia capsules detailing the FTC’s allegations regarding their efficacy claims. In addition, the order requires the defendants to notify Amazon, Inc. that they purchased Amazon reviews of their Quality Encapsulations Garcinia Cambogia capsules and to identify to Amazon the purchased reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the order imposes a judgment of $12.8 million, which will be suspended upon payment of $50,000 to the Commission and the payment of certain unpaid income tax obligations. If the defendants are later found to have misrepresented their financial condition to the FTC, the full amount of the judgment will immediately become due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and proposed stipulated final order was 5-0. The FTC filed the complaint and proposed order in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated final injunctions/orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection&quot;&gt;protect and educate consumers&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>The most popular docker images each contain at least 30 vulnerabilities</title>
<link>https://snyk.io/blog/top-ten-most-popular-docker-images-each-contain-at-least-30-vulnerabilities/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://snyk.io/blog/top-ten-most-popular-docker-images-each-contain-at-least-30-vulnerabilities/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Snyk’s annual State of Open Source Security report 2019.&lt;br/&gt;This report is split into several posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or download our lovely handcrafted pdf report which contains all of this information and more in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn-small&quot; href=&quot;https://bit.ly/SoOSS2019&quot;&gt;DOWNLOAD THE STATE OF OPEN SOURCE SECURITY REPORT 2019!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of application container technology is increasing at a remarkable rate and is expected to grow by a further 40% in 2020, according to 451 Research. It is common for system libraries to be available in many docker images, as these rely on a parent image that is commonly using a Linux distribution as a base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker images almost always bring known vulnerabilities alongside their great value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve scanned through ten of the most popular images with Snyk’s recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/container-vulnerability-management-for-developers/&quot;&gt;docker scanning capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that in every docker image we scanned, we found vulnerable versions of system libraries. The official Node.js image ships 580 vulnerable system libraries, followed by the others each of which ship at least 30 publicly known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8032&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121069/Number_of_OS_vulnerabilities_by_docker_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number of OS vulnerabilities by docker image&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;563&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyk recently released its container vulnerability management solution to empower developers to fully own the security of their dockerized applications. Using this new capability, developers can find known vulnerabilities in their docker base images and fix them using Snyk’s remediation advice. Snyk suggests either a minimal upgrade, or alternative base images that contain fewer or even no vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix can be easy if you’re aware. 20% of images can fix vulnerabilities simply by rebuilding a docker image, 44% by swapping base image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on scans performed by Snyk users, we found that 44% of docker image scans had known vulnerabilities, and for which there were newer and more secure base image available. This remediation advise is unique to Snyk. Developers can take action to upgrade their docker images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyk also reported that 20% of docker image scans had known vulnerabilities that simply required a rebuild of the image to reduce the number of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Long Term Support (LTS) version of the Node.js runtime is version 10. The image tagged with 10 (i.e: node:10) is essentially an alias to node:10.14.2- jessie (at the time that we tested it) where jessie specifies an obsolete version of Debian that is no longer actively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had chosen that image as a base image in your Dockerfile, you’d be exposing yourself to 582 vulnerable system libraries bundled with the image. Another option is to use the node:10-slim image tag which provides slimmer images without unnecessary dependencies (for example: it omits the main pages and other assets). Choosing node:10-slim however would still pull in 71 vulnerable system libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most vulnerabilities originate in the base image you selected. For that reason, remediation should focus on base image fixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The node:10-alpine image is a better option to choose if you want a very small base image with a minimal set of system libraries. However, while no vulnerabilities were detected in the version of the Alpine image we tested, that’s not to say that it is necessarily free of security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpine Linux handles vulnerabilities differently than the other major distros, who prefer to backport sets of patches. At Alpine, they prefer rapid release cycles for their images, with each image release providing a system library upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8033&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121266/Number_of_vulnerabilities_by_node_image_tag.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number of vulnerabilities by node image tag&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; height=&quot;637&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Alpine Linux doesn’t maintain a security advisory program, which means that if a system library has vulnerabilities, Alpine Linux will not issue an official advisory about it; Alpine Linux will mitigate the vulnerability by creating a new base image version including a new version of that library that fixes the issue, if one is available (as opposed to backporting as mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that the newer fixed version, of a vulnerable library will be immediately available on Alpine Linux, although that is the case many times. Despite this, if you can safely move to the Alpine Linux version without breaking your application, you can reduce the attack surface of your environment because you will be using fewer libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of an image tag, like node:10, is in reality an alias to another image, which constantly rotates with new minor and patched versions of 10 as they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8034&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551121369/Docker_terminal_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Docker terminal screenshot&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;860&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practice that some teams follow is to use a specific version tag instead of an alias so that their base image would be node:10.8.0-jessie for example. However, as newer releases of Node 10 are released, there is a good chance those newer images will include fewer system library vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Snyk Docker scanning features we found that when a project uses a specific version tag such as node:10.8.0-jessie, we could then recommend newer images that contain fewer vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported for system libraries, affecting some of the popular Linux distributions such as Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. In 2018 alone we tracked 1,597 vulnerabilities in system libraries with known CVEs assigned for these distros, which is more than four times the number of vulnerabilities compared to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8029&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551120743/Linux_OS_vulnerabilities_steadily_increasing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Linux OS vulnerabilities steadily increasing&quot; width=&quot;788&quot; height=&quot;562&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at the breakdown of vulnerabilities (high and critical) it is clear that this severity level is continuing to increase through 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-8030&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1551120779/High_and_critical_vulnerabilities_in_system_libraries.png&quot; alt=&quot;High and critical vulnerabilities in system libraries&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;713&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ETS Isn&amp;#039;t TLS and You Shouldn&amp;#039;t Use It</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/blog/tls13/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3&lt;/a&gt; is available, and the protocol, which powers HTTPS and many other encrypted communications, is better and more secure than its predecessors (including SSL).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bad news: Thanks to a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/KQIyNhPk8K6jOoe2ScdPZ8E08RE&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;financial industry group called BITS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, there’s a look-alike protocol brewing called called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103500_103599/10352303/01.01.01_60/ts_10352303v010101p.pdf#page=8&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETS (or eTLS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that intentionally disables important security measures in TLS 1.3. If someone suggests that you should deploy ETS instead of TLS 1.3, they are selling you snake oil and you should run in the other direction as fast as you can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2019/02/25/tls-1.3-is-not-ets.png&quot; width=&quot;857&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; alt=&quot; It's Better Than ETS&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETS vs. TLS / SSL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETS removes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;forward secrecy&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that is so widely used and valued in TLS 1.2 that TLS 1.3 made it mandatory. This invisibly undermines security and has the potential to seriously worsen data breaches. As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103500_103599/10352303/01.01.01_60/ts_10352303v010101p.pdf#page=15&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ETS / eTLS spec&lt;/a&gt; says: &quot;eTLS does not provide per-session forward secrecy. Knowledge of a given static Diffie-Hellman private key can be used to decrypt all sessions encrypted with that key.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In earlier versions of TLS and SSL, forward secrecy was an optional feature. If enabled, it ensured that intercepted communications couldn’t be retrospectively decrypted,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;even by someone who later got a copy of the server’s private key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This remarkable property is so valuable for security that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which develops Internet standards including TLS, decided that TLS 1.3 would&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;offer algorithms that provide forward secrecy. The post-facto decryption weakness in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions is now considered a bug. It’s a product of its time that was produced by a number of factors, like government pressure not to implement stronger algorithms, a cloud of patent-related uncertainty around elliptic curve algorithms, and processor speed in the early 2000’s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nowadays, it just makes plain sense to use forward secrecy for all TLS connections. Unfortunately, during the long tenure of TLS 1.2, some companies, mostly banks, came to rely on its specific weaknesses. Late in the TLS 1.3 process,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/KQIyNhPk8K6jOoe2ScdPZ8E08RE&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BITS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/KQIyNhPk8K6jOoe2ScdPZ8E08RE&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of these companies and said their members “depend upon the ability to decrypt TLS traffic to implement data loss protection, intrusion detection and prevention, malware detection, packet capture and analysis, and DDoS mitigation.” In other words, BITS members send a copy of all encrypted traffic somewhere else for monitoring. The monitoring devices have a copy of all private keys, and so can decrypt all that traffic. They’d like TLS 1.3 to offer algorithms that disable forward secrecy so they can keep doing this decryption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there’s a real harm that comes from weakening a critical protocol to provide easier in-datacenter monitoring for a small handful of organizations. Public-facing web servers might also implement the proposed weaker algorithms, either intentionally or accidentally, and this would expose billions of people’s data to easier snooping. Plus, this isn’t even a good way to do in-datacenter monitoring–with control of the servers, an organization can log data at their servers rather than relying on post-hoc decryption. Server-side logging can also redact sensitive data like plaintext passwords that should never be retained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In response to these objections, some IETF participants produced a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-green-tls-static-dh-in-tls13-01&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;modest proposal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: By tweaking some parameters, they could make a TLS 1.3 server look like it was providing forward secrecy, but actually not provide it. This proposal, mentioned earlier and called “Static Diffie-Hellman,” would misuse a number in the handshake that is supposed to be random and discarded after each handshake. Instead of randomly generating that number (the Diffie-Hellman private key), a server using this technique would use the same number for all connections, and make sure to share a copy of it with the devices doing decryption. This would only require changes to servers, not clients, and would look just like the secure version of TLS 1.3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After much discussion, IETF decided not to standardize this modest proposal. Its risks were too great. So BITS took it to another standards organization,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsi.org/committee/1393-cyber&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETSI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which was more willing to play ball. ETSI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workProgram/Report_Schedule.asp?WKI_ID=53613&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;has been working&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on its weakened variant since 2017, and in October 2018 released a document&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103500_103599/10352303/01.01.01_60/ts_10352303v010101p.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;calling their proposal eTLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-52/rev-2/draft/documents/sp800-52r2-draft2-comments-received.pdf#page=14&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;submitted public comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;asking NIST to delay publication of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-52/rev-2/draft&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;new guidelines on using TLS 1.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and recommend eTLS instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Enterprise” Transport Security Tries to Use TLS’ Good Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, the IETF caught wind of this and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1616/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;strenuously objected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to the misleading use of the name TLS in “eTLS:” “Our foremost concern remains the use of a name that implies the aegis of Transport Layer Security (TLS), a well-known protocol which has been developed by the IETF for over twenty years.” ETSI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1624/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;backed down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and the next revision of their weakened variant will be called “ETS” instead. Instead of thinking of this as “Enterprise Transport Security,” which the creators say the acronym stands for, you should think of it as “Extra Terrible Security.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internet security as a whole is greatly improved by forward secrecy. It’s indefensible to make it worse in the name of protecting a few banks from having to update their legacy decrypt systems. Decryption makes networks less secure, and anyone who tells you differently is selling something (probably a decryption middlebox). Don’t use ETS, don’t implement it, and don’t standardize it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>ETS Isn't TLS and You Shouldn't Use It</og:title>
<og:url>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it</og:url>
<og:description>The good news: TLS 1.3 is available, and the protocol, which powers HTTPS and many other encrypted communications, is better and more secure than its predecessors (including SSL). The bad news: Thanks to a financial industry group called BITS, there’s a look-alike protocol brewing called called ETS...</og:description>

<title>Cloudflare expands its government warrant canaries</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/cloudflare-warrant-canary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/cloudflare-warrant-canary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;When the government comes for your data, tech companies can’t always tell you. But thanks to a legal loophole, companies can say if they haven’t had a visit yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s opened up an interesting clause that allows companies to silently warn customers when the government turns up to secretly raid its stash of customer data without violating a gag order it. Under U.S. freedom of speech laws, companies can publicly say that “the government has not been here” when there has been no demand for data, but they are allowed to remove statements when a warrant comes in as a warning shot to anyone who pays attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These so-called “warrant canaries” — named for the poor canary down the mine that dies when there’s gas that humans can’t detect — are a key transparency tool that predominantly privacy-focused companies use to keep their customers aware of the goings-on behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where companies have abandoned their canaries or caved to legal pressure, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cloudflare&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; is bucking the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking and content delivery network giant said in a blog post this week that it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-update-joining-cloudflares-flock-of-warrant-canaries-2/&quot;&gt;expanding the transparency reports&lt;/a&gt; to include more canaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;has never turned over their SSL keys or customers’ SSL keys to anyone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never installed any law enforcement software or equipment anywhere on their network;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has never provided any law enforcement organization a feed of customers’ content transiting their network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those key points are critical to the company’s business. A government demand &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/ladar-levison-finally-confirms-snowden-was-target-of-lavabit-investigation/&quot;&gt;for SSL keys&lt;/a&gt; and installing intercept equipment on its network would allow investigators unprecedented access to a customer’s communications and data, and undermine the company’s security. A similar demand led to Ladar Levison &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/ladar-levison-finally-confirms-snowden-was-target-of-lavabit-investigation/&quot;&gt;shutting down his email service Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; when they sought the keys to obtain information on whistleblower Edward Snowden, who used the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Cloudflare’s warrant canaries will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never modified customer content at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never modified the intended destination of DNS responses at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudflare has never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of its encryption at the request of law enforcement or another third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also expanded and replaced its first canary to confirm that the company “has never turned over our encryption or authentication keys or our customers’ encryption or authentication keys to anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare said that if it were ever asked to do any of the above, the company would “exhaust all legal remedies” to protect customer data, and remove the statements from its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking and content delivery network is one of a handful of major companies that have used warrant canaries over the years. Following reports that the National Security Agency was vacuuming up the call records from &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/nsa-att-intercept-surveillance/&quot;&gt;the major telecom giants in bulk&lt;/a&gt;, Apple included a statement in its most recent transparency reports noting that the company has to date “not received any orders for bulk data.” Reddit removed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/reddit-warrant-canary-hints-it-got-a-national-security-letter/&quot;&gt;its warrant canary in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that it had received a national security order it wasn’t permitted to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s expanded canaries were included in the company’s latest transparency report, out this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its latest figures covering the second half of 2018, Cloudflare responded to just seven subpoenas of the 19 requests, affecting 12 accounts and 309 domains. The company also responded to 44 court orders of the 55 requests, affecting 134 accounts and 19,265 domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company received between 0-249 national security requests for the duration, and didn’t process any wiretap or foreign government requests for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
