<title>Adequate Vitamin D Levels Cuts Risk of Dying from Covid-19 in Half, Study Finds</title>

&lt;p&gt;There’s new evidence that getting enough vitamin D provides significant support in protecting hospitalized individuals infected with Covid-19 from adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) analyzed data from 235 people who were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. They found that patients older than 40 years old were 51.5 percent less likely to die from the infection if they had a sufficient level of Vitamin D, which they define as being at least 30 ng/mL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael F. Holick, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799&quot; aria-label=&quot;lead author of the study&quot;&gt;lead author of the study&lt;/a&gt;, and professor of medicine, physiology and biophysics, and molecular medicine at BUSM, says, “This study provides direct evidence that vitamin D sufficiency can reduce the complications, including the cytokine storm (release to too many proteins into the blood too quickly) and ultimately death from Covid-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study were followed for the following clinical outcomes including clinical severity of the infection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·        Becoming unconscious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·        Having difficulty in breathing resulting in hypoxia and death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·        Blood analyzed for inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;recirc-unit recirc-unit-open&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommended For You&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·        Blood analyzed for numbers of lymphocytes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·        All parameters compared between groups of patients divided by vitamin D deficient and vitamin D sufficient&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study authors point out some limitations in the study that involve the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patients were included with had recorded 25 (OH) vitamin D levels. The study says “Some confounding factors, such as smoking, and social economic status were not recorded for all patients and could have a plausible impact on the Covid-19 severity. Also, the RT-PCR test was not performed on all patients with clinical signs of Covid-19.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The design of the study is cross-sectional, and therefore authors cannot explain the cause and effect relationship of vitamin D sufficiency and the reduced risk of severity from a Covid-19 infection. In order to study cause and effect, there will need to be large-scale studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holick published a separate study recently that found having a sufficient level of vitamin D can reduce the risk of catching Covid-19 by 54-percent. He also believes having adequate vitamin D levels helps ward off other viruses causing upper respiratory tract illnesses including influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holick says, “Because vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is so widespread in children and adults in the United States and worldwide, especially in winter months, it is prudent for everyone to take a vitamin D supplement to reduce risk of being infected and having complications from Covid-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/adjunctive-therapy/vitamin-d/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot; title=&quot;https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/adjunctive-therapy/vitamin-d/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-ga-track=&quot;ExternalLink:https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/adjunctive-therapy/vitamin-d/&quot; aria-label=&quot;statement&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; saying “There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, during an interview on September 10, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease said, “If you are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection. So I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Someone has stolen my Instagram account</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;So it seems that employees with the right access at Facebook can just give your account to someone else. What’s happened to all my data? Photos, messages... 10 years of it. Does this guy in LA now have it? Has it been deleted? Will I ever get it back?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-4&quot; src=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;foo1&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo1.gif 434w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo1-300x294.gif 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the earliest of early days, I (The Foo at bar.com) got a few emails a week, mostly from sysadmin type people who were invoking The Foo in an effort to debug some kind of system or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5&quot; src=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;foo2&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo2.gif 434w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo2-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo2-298x300.gif 298w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I, being a gregarious sort, answered the messages.  Mostly along the lines of “hello?  Foo here.  What can I do for you?” or “who you?  I Foo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a lot of really interesting people in 1994 and 1995 that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo3.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-6&quot; src=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;foo3&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo3.gif 434w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo3-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo3-300x297.gif 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But soon I had to return to obscurity, as my email volume turned into craziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y’see people building web sites started putting little “give us your email address and we’ll let you see the goodies” challenges in their web sites, and lots of folks entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea8c8585aa888b98c4898587&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e2848d8da2808390cc818d8f&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I was getting thousands, then tens of thousands of emails a day, mostly from people who didn’t care whether I replied or not.   Alas, I was overwhelmed and had to return to my solitary life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I MX’d email addressed to me to 127.0.0.1 but that made some people cranky (although I still take some quiet pleasure at the thought of what that address did to spammers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I MX’d the mail over to a friend’s spam-detection system for about 4 hours one time, but the volume crashed his server and he asked for relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo4.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-7&quot; src=&quot;https://bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;foo4&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo4.gif 434w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo4-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.bar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/foo4-297x300.gif 297w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I’m content to tell you this small story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:  My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haven2.com&quot;&gt;Mike O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; manages this domain for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloudflare keeps sending emails over a year after account was cancelled</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/09/dont-trust-cloudflare-with-your-personal-data/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/09/dont-trust-cloudflare-with-your-personal-data/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since I cancelled my Cloudflare account. They keep emailing me and haven’t taken me off their marketing lists despite repeated requests. Their CTO told me he would investigate, but nothing changed. Their Data Protection Office hasn’t respond to my requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare do not appear to respect the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve escalated this to the highest levels of Cloudflare, but they just don’t seem to be able to take any action. This is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200831140831/https://twitter.com/edent/status/1300435043228299265&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-18-Terence-Eden-on-Twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;JGC promising he'll look into it.&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-36765&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Done. It was the email apologising for your most recent outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Terence Eden (@edent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edent/status/1300435043228299265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, John Graham-Cumming – the CTO – deleted his Tweet saying that he’d look into it. I assume that JGC doesn’t like his personal data being misused. If only I were able to delete my personal data from Cloudflare, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200831140831/https://twitter.com/edent/status/1300435043228299265&quot;&gt;Internet Archive has a backup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite promising an investigation and a response from their Data Protection Office – I’ve received no assurance that they have respected my rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of August last year, I cancelled my Cloudflare account. I received confirmation from them that I was no longer a customer. My login was disabled. That should have been the last I heard from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/11/can-you-trust-cloudflare-with-your-personal-data/&quot;&gt;I received an email update about their privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CloudFlare-Privacy-fs8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email with CloudFlare's new privacy policy.&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-32920&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complained on Twitter, and their CTO promised he’d look into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20191115123322/https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1195314797954379783&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-18-John-Graham-Cumming-on-Twitter.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;566&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-36766&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Again, tweet deleted, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20191115123322/https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1195314797954379783&quot;&gt;saved in the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never heard back from John. But one of his minions sent me this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we receive a request for account deletion, we may retain the email address on the account up to a year to ensure that we comply with internal policies and legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Pffft*&lt;/em&gt; Whatever. No mention of that is made in their privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of August this year – well over 12 months after I unsubscribed – I received &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; email from Cloudflare. This time apologising for their downtime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; data-partner=&quot;jetpack&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just received more spam from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Cloudflare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;. With no unsubscribe link.&lt;br/&gt;It has been more than a year since I asked them to delete my account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot trust Cloudflare with your personal data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/y3QkYagM81&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/y3QkYagM81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Terence Eden (@edent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edent/status/1300430745585029121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; option to unsubscribe. I’m not a customer – but apparently I still have to receive emails from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a message from someone at Cloudflare who said that they have &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; customer mailing lists and they are rarely in sync with each other. They don’t have a good idea of who they are sending emails to, or whether people have consented. I think this is unacceptable for a company of this size to be so lax about their GDPR obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Cloudflare to report this breach to the Information Commissioners Office, and I suggested that they may need to notify the SEC if they are expecting a large fine. They may also need to let investors know if they have misrepresented their customer numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked JGC and Cloudflare PR for a comment – but they were not inclined to provide one. They said their DPO would get back to me last week, but I heard nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I can only conclude that Cloudflare do not respect their users’ privacy. Cloudflare has no idea who its customers are, nor how many they have. Cloudflare doesn’t care about your data rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*bitter laugh*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html&quot;&gt;Assumed Audience&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; People who care about &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; learning (in this case, software developers in particular). Also, my wife, who really enjoys hearing me say, &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;I was wrong.” 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/epistemic-status/&quot;&gt;Epistemic Status&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; These are things I &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; think I’m wrong about. But I’ve changed my mind on them once already, so…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty rare, at least in my experience, for people to discuss things they were &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; about in the past. Even when we post &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;I think this new thing!” we rarely call out exactly what it was we changed our minds about. So in this series — as part of my ongoing exercise of modeling &lt;em&gt;learning in public&lt;/em&gt; on this site — I’m going to dig through things I currently think I was simply &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; about. Topics will range from software (as today) to theology and anything else that comes to mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you talked to me about types in programming languages six or seven years ago, you would quickly have learned that I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fan. I had spent the preceding years working in Fortran and C, with a touch of Java thrown in, and my experience of types was that they added a great deal of overhead and didn’t remotely pay for themselves. I was working with Python and JavaScript and simply didn’t miss types &lt;em&gt;at. all&lt;/em&gt;, even in fairly complex systems. I told a colleague at one point that I thought types were basically worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, all of that changed. I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/l/maybe-haskell/&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Maybe Haskell&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a plane that spring, and I encountered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; about two months later, and all of a sudden I had a very different outlook on types. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the entire trajectory of my professional career shifted in that two-month span. Since then, I’ve run &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrustacean.com&quot;&gt;a podcast about Rust&lt;/a&gt; which included no few discussions about type theory, helped bootstrap an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ember-cli-typescript.com&quot;&gt;entire sub-community&lt;/a&gt; for another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org&quot;&gt;typed programming language&lt;/a&gt; (which is now part of my day job), and written a hilarious amount about types and how they can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why I thought that types were worthless from 2012 – 2014. In fact, for the specific languages I had used up to that point, I continue to think that the types &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; really pay for themselves. But I have substantially changed my tune about type systems more generally. &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; type systems can make a substantial difference in the kinds of programs you can write, and the degree of value you get out of them is much higher relative to the effort you put in to get that value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key differentiators between the type systems I didn’t value and those I now do — between thinking all type systems were worthless and thinking a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; type system is worth its weight in gold — were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type inference:&lt;/strong&gt; because having to write out every type, however obvious, is an incredible waste of time. &lt;code&gt;Person me = new Person();&lt;/code&gt; is ridiculous. &lt;code&gt;let me = new Person();&lt;/code&gt; may seem like a small improvement, but spread over the body of an entire program and generalized to all sorts of contexts means that type annotations become a tool you employ &lt;em&gt;because they’re useful&lt;/em&gt; — for communicating to others, or for constraining the program in particular ways — rather than merely because the compiler yells at you about something it should know perfectly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sum/tagged union types:&lt;/strong&gt; because a great many of the problems we solve in software come down to well-defined options: &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, and with discrete options for what data goes with each of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;. Lots of problems also &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; fit into that space, but enough do that missing a tool to express it feels painful. In fact, I had been reaching for my own ways of building &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;sum types” in C and Python for years before finally discovering that the idea already existed and the tools around it were great… in other languages. The fact that languages with first-class support for sum types also come with exhaustiveness checking for those was the icing on the cake. It meant that I could finally tell the computer what I meant, and have it check me — and it also mean that if I changed my mind later, I could tell the computer &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and have it tell me every place I needed to update my assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundness:&lt;/strong&gt; I was sick to death of &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;undefined is not a function&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()&lt;/code&gt;. But at least in untyped languages, I had only myself to blame for these errors. Getting them in a language with types was utterly infuriating: why couldn’t the compiler tell me that I had missed a case where something could be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;? And this problem was general: the compiler simply couldn’t tell me whether my program actually followed the rules I wanted it to follow, no matter how much work I put into the types. Soundness changed all of that. It didn’t mean I was free from logic bugs. (Nothing can do that in the general case!) It did mean that a program which type-checked wouldn’t blow up &lt;em&gt;in ways the type-checker said it shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three differences allowed me to turn types into tools for thought, means of communicating both to other programmers and to the computer. It let me specify the invariants I wanted to remain true, assured that the compiler would tell me if they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; held true or not, and assured that the compiler wouldn’t just be lying to me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types are not perfect. They still have tradeoffs. Some type systems &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; worth it. But five years ago, I changed my mind about the value of type systems &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, because I learned about type systems that I hadn’t known about previously. And, critically, this taught me to be far less dogmatic about the value of ideas in programming languages and software development in general. If smart people see the value in something and I don’t, it’s quite likely that I have missed something, and there’s something to learn from them!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concrete is the most widely used man-made material in existence. It is second only to water as the most-consumed resource on the planet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, while cement - the key ingredient in concrete - has shaped much of our built environment, it also has a massive carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cement is the source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://reader.chathamhouse.org/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions,&lt;/a&gt; according to think tank Chatham House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world - behind China and the US. It contributes more CO2 than aviation fuel (2.5%) and is not far behind the global agriculture business (12%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Charts showing the rise in cement production and related CO2 emissions&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1313C/production/_104804187_biggest_cement_producers_976px_v3-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;2035&quot; height=&quot;1611&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cement industry leaders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gccassociation.org/press-release/gcca-heads-world-climate-change-conference-cop24&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;in Poland for the UN's climate change conference&lt;/a&gt; - COP24 - to discuss ways of meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change. To do this, annual emissions from cement will need to fall by at least 16% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how did our love of concrete end up endangering the planet? And what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;In praise of concrete&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the key building material of most tower blocks, car parks, bridges and dams, concrete has, for the haters, enabled the construction of some of the world's worst architectural eyesores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, it helped the massive wave of post-World War Two development - much of it still dividing opinion -  with several of the country's major cities, such as Birmingham, Coventry, Hull and Portsmouth, largely defined by the concrete structures from that building push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Birmingham is known for its concrete structures
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concrete is also the reason some of the world's most impressive buildings exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney Opera House, the Lotus Temple in Delhi, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as well as the magnificent Pantheon in Rome - boasting the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world - all owe their form to the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    The unreinforced concrete dome of the Pantheon in Rome has yet to be beaten in size
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of sand and gravel, a cement binder and water, concrete is so widely embraced by architects, structural engineers, developers and builders because it is a remarkably good construction material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's affordable, you can produce it almost anywhere and it has all the right structural qualities that you want to build with for a durable building or for infrastructure,&quot; explains Felix Preston, deputy research director at the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite known durability problems with using steel reinforcement, which can crack concrete from the inside, it is still the go-to material across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Building without concrete, although it is possible, is challenging,&quot; says Mr Preston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Growth of cement industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is these unrivalled attributes of concrete that have helped boost global cement production since the 1950s, with Asia and China accounting for the bulk of growth from the 1990s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/essd-10-195-2018.pdf&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;increased more than thirtyfold since 1950 and almost fourfold since 1990.&lt;/a&gt; China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the entire 20th Century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Chart showing the rise in cement production since 1970&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8060/production/_104746823_cement_production2-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;1632&quot; height=&quot;1442&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Chinese consumption now appearing to level off, most future growth in construction is expected to happen in the emerging markets of South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - driven by rapid urbanisation and economic development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The floor area of the world's buildings is projected to double in the next 40 years, say Chatham House researchers, requiring cement production to increase by a quarter by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Concrete has a long history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of us assume concrete is a recent addition to our cities, architects, and builders have actually been using cement-like binders for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest use is believed to have been more than 8,000 years ago, with traders in Syria and Jordan using such binders to create floors, buildings and underground cisterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Romans were known to be masters of cement and concrete, building the Pantheon in Rome in 113-125AD, with its 43m-diameter free-standing concrete dome the largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the concrete used in our modern-built environment owes much of its make-up to a process patented in the early 19th Century by bricklayer Joseph Aspdin of Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His new technique of roasting limestone and clay in an oven and then grinding it to a powder to make &quot;artificial stone&quot; is now known as Portland cement - still the key ingredient in almost all modern concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Presentational grey line&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13E83/production/_103693518_086b2036-0a30-4a6f-a4a0-94c46832b58f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, despite its ubiquitous presence, concrete's environmental credentials have come under increased scrutiny in the last couple of decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the production of Portland cement involve quarrying - causing airborne pollution in the form of dust - it also requires the use of massive kilns, which require large amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual chemical process of making cement also emits staggeringly high levels of CO2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46384067&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Climate change: Where we are in seven charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46459714&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;What is your diet's carbon footprint?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46582265&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Five things we've learnt from COP24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Action needed'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sector has made progress - improvements in the energy-efficiency of new plants and burning waste materials instead of fossil fuels has seen the average CO2 emissions per tonne of output fall by 18% over the last few decades, according to Chatham House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly-established Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), currently representing about 35% of the world's cement production capacity and with a focus on sustainable development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gccassociation.org/press-release/gcca-heads-world-climate-change-conference-cop24&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;was at COP24.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Benjamin Sporton says the fact the organisation now exists &quot;is a demonstration of the commitment of the industry to sustainability, including taking action on climate change&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCCA is due to publish a set of sustainability guidelines, which its membership will have to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By bringing together global players to provide leadership and focus, as well as delivering a detailed work programme, we can help ensure a sustainable future for cement and concrete, and for the needs of future generations,&quot; Mr Sporton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/tcep/industry/cement/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;world cement production generated around 2.2 billion tonnes of CO2&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/essd-10-195-2018.pdf&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;equivalent to 8% of the global total.&lt;/a&gt; More than half of that came from the calcination process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with thermal combustion, 90% of the sector's emissions could be attributed to the production of clinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Chart showing how making 'clinker' accounts for most of the CO2 in cement-making&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/23B4/production/_104804190_why_clinker_is_bad_976px_v3-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;2035&quot; height=&quot;917&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Mr Preston and his colleagues argue the sector urgently needs to pursue a number of CO2 reduction strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further efforts on energy efficiency, a move away from fossil fuels and pursuing carbon capture and storage will help, but can only do so much.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've got a long way to close the gap,&quot; Mr Preston says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the industry really needs to do is plough efforts into producing new types of cement, he argues. In fact, low-carbon cements and &quot;novel cements&quot; might do away with the need for clinker altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;New cements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those trying to drum up greater support for such alternative cements is Ginger Krieg Dosier, co-founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://biomason.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;BioMason -  a start-up in North Carolina that uses trillions of bacteria to grow bio-concrete bricks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique, which involves placing sand in moulds and injecting it with microorganisms, initiates a process similar to the one that creates coral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a long fascination with marine cements and structures,&quot; explains Ms Krieg Dosier, a trained architect who was surprised to find no real green alternatives to bricks and masonry when she began research at an architectural firm more than 10 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery led her to create her own solution, which, after years of development, now takes only four days. It happens at room temperature, without the need for fossil fuels or calcination - two of the main sources of the cement industry's CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Datapic showing the potential of action to reduce CO2 emissions&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15621/production/_104758578_concrete_datapic-nc.png&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Krieg Dosier believes green cements and technologies such as hers offer a solution to the sector's emissions issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Traditional Portland-based cement production practices will continue to release CO2 due to its fundamental chemistry,&quot; she says, adding that rather than turning to carbon capture and storage, we should be investing more in techniques that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alternative cements and binding technologies go beyond evolutionary CO2 capture to revolutionary methods that fundamentally sequester CO2.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Disruptive forces'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside such alternative cements, other &quot;disruptive&quot; forces are also beginning to drive change. Digitalisation, machine learning and an increasing awareness of sustainability are all having an impact on the cement industry's culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's partly changing because of how people want to live, but also because of our ability to dream up new and innovative structures and test those with computer models,&quot; says Mr Preston. &quot;There's also the ability to build things more cheaply with robots - with automation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changing processes quickly enough to meet the cement industry's obligations will be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sector is dominated by a small number of major producers who are reluctant to experiment or change business models. Architects, engineers, contractors and clients are also, rather understandably, cautious about using new building materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This quite slow-moving, difficult-to-change sector is starting to bump against these quite profound disruptions that we're starting to see in the built environment,&quot; says Mr Preston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, with very few low-carbon cements reaching commercialisation, and none being applied at scale in an industry where bigger and taller is often the ambition, it looks likely that sustained government support will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without governments applying pressure on the industry or providing funding, it may not be possible to get the next generation of low-carbon cements out of the laboratory and into the market within the required timescale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the timescale is ever-shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the leading international body on global warming - last month argued the global average temperature rise needed to be kept below 1.5C - not 2C as noted in the Paris Agreement. This means CO2 emissions need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other young companies, Ms Krieg Dosier describes the difficulties of simultaneously developing and marketing her products and scaling up manufacturing processes to compete within the wider construction industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Concrete is the chosen material for most large-scale projects
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she thinks there are reasons to be optimistic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do believe the construction industry is approaching a point where alternative materials will be more widely adopted,&quot; she says. &quot;This is in part due to market demand, other innovative technologies and wider concern for climate change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cement industry, too, points to more optimistic assessments of the industry's progress on emissions and suggests that, across its lifetime, concrete could make a net climate benefit when all possible action is taken into account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes re-carbonation (or the re-absorption of CO2 by cement), concrete's contribution to the energy efficiency of buildings, and innovation in the way cement is manufactured - including carbon capture and storage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCCA says such innovation is its key priority in the months and years ahead. Projects are already underway and showing promise, it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Preston says it is imperative that governments and industry now act quickly at a time when global development is expected to rise but CO2 emissions need to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a desperate need for quality, affordable homes,&quot; he says. &quot;There's a need for new infrastructure. We can only square this circle if we can dramatically improve the way that we build, so that overall these buildings are constructed with, as close as possible, net zero emissions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Design by Lilly Huynh.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Social-media platforms are destroying evidence of war crimes</title>

<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;article__aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;time itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/DateTime&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-09-26T00:00:00Z&quot; class=&quot;article__dateline-datetime&quot;&gt;Sep 26th 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;“P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;UT YOUR&lt;/small&gt; hands up! Put your hands up!” shouts a gunman at his hooded captive, who already has two hands in the air and shuffles about, seemingly unsure what more to do. The gunman then shoots his victim to the ground before firing more bullets into the body and saying: “You have been misled by Satan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Until fairly recently, brutal acts such as this might never have come to light. But a video showing this murder was posted on Facebook in 2016. A year later the International Criminal Court (&lt;small&gt;ICC&lt;/small&gt;) issued its first-ever warrant that relied, in large part, on videos posted on social media by the perpetrators of war crimes themselves. It called for the arrest of Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a Libyan warlord (pictured). It accused him of being the gunman in the killing described above and of being responsible for murdering 33 people in seven incidents captured in videos on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Although Mr Werfalli has yet to appear before the &lt;small&gt;ICC&lt;/small&gt; in The Hague, the warrant for his arrest marked a turning-point. For the first time videos and photos posted on social media would not only be used to bring the world’s attention to war crimes, but could also offer hope of bringing the perpetrators to justice. “This is a mine of potential evidence,” wrote Emma Irving, a human-rights expert at Leiden University, in a blog post at the time. Yet for all its promise, the use of social-media evidence also raises real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;For a start, evidence posted on social media is far from perfect. People recording atrocities often lack expertise or may be partisan and thus film selectively. Prosecutors and judges may worry that footage has been staged, manipulated or misattributed. These worries will further increase, as it becomes easier to get computers with artificial intelligence to make “deep fakes” or highly plausible audio and video forgeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Yet because it is difficult and dangerous to gather evidence in war zones, such footage may be all that prosecutors have to go on. At the very least it can provide new leads, or help to corroborate eyewitness reports and other evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Fighters bragging about their exploits on Facebook may inadvertently give away their location. They may also provide prosecutors with evidence of intent. Such information can help war-crimes prosecutors assemble the gold standard of evidence: a combination of the physical, documentary and testimonial varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In 2018 the &lt;small&gt;BBC&lt;/small&gt; looked into a video circulating on social media showing soldiers blindfolding and then shooting two women and children in Cameroon. Although Cameroon’s government initially claimed the video was faked or from elsewhere, the &lt;small&gt;BBC&lt;/small&gt; and freelance investigators matched mountains in the background of the footage to maps and satellite images. By analysing shadows on the ground they were able to work out that the killings happened in 2015. To identify the soldiers involved they matched the weapons in the video to those used by specific units in the Cameroonian army. Shamed into action, the government investigated and prosecuted seven soldiers. This week four of them were sentenced to ten years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justice deleted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Yet even as prosecutors and the courts are discovering the uses of such evidence, much of it is disappearing. Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, recently revisited the social-media evidence it had cited in its public reports between 2007 and 2020 (though most were published in the past five years). It found that 11% of it had vanished. Others have run into similar problems. The Syrian Archive, a non-profit group that records and analyses evidence of atrocities in Syria, estimates that 21% of the nearly 1.75m YouTube videos it had catalogued up to June 2020 are no longer available. Almost 12% of the 1m or so tweets it logged have also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Some of this content will have been deleted by users themselves, but much has been removed by internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter. Sometimes they scrub horrific content for good reasons. They want to protect users from snuff videos and extremist propaganda. Under pressure from activists and governments, many have adopted stringent content-moderation policies. But because there is little, if any, regulation over what happens to content that is removed by social-media firms, there is no certainty that it will be preserved if it is later needed as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Algorithmic moderation makes the problem worse. In 2017 a new YouTube algorithm proved unable to differentiate between material posted by Islamic State glorifying its killings and that from human-rights activists who were documenting them. YouTube removed hundreds of thousands of videos of abuses in Syria. Many of these were restored after a public outcry, but newer algorithms now take down content before it ever reaches the public. Of the content that Facebook removed for violating its guidelines between January and March, 93% was flagged by automatic systems, not by human moderators. Of those items, half were removed before any viewer saw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Human-rights groups argue that internet platforms should be obliged to preserve deleted content, or pass it on to independent archives. In Syria, for instance, had the Syrian Archive not collected copies of videos and tweets showing abuses, much of this evidence would have been lost, and with it any hope of justice for many of those who risked their lives to bear witness, by pressing “record”. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-test-id=&quot;Footnote&quot; class=&quot;article__footnote&quot;&gt;This article appeared in the Middle East &amp;amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Accidental cover-up&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MINI EV’s runaway success underscores the latent demand for electric cars at the right price point. Tesla earlier this week said it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-09-23/musk-says-tesla-plans-25-000-electric-car-in-next-3-years-video&quot;&gt;plans to build&lt;/a&gt; a $25,000 EV in about three years. One of the biggest challenges in making EVs cheaper is the battery, which currently represents about one-quarter of a car’s cost because of the expensive metals used, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of consumers don’t need anything fancy, a commute is all they ask from a car,” said Yale Zhang, founder of AutoForesight, a Shanghai-based consultancy. “I’m all for a product like the MINI EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;31.819241982507&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12.166180758017&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car is also a fillip for GM in China, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/gm-can-t-keep-up-in-china-once-seen-as-the-promised-land&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; has been on the decline. The U.S. automaker said in January it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/gm-warns-china-will-remain-weak-this-year-after-sales-slump&quot;&gt;sold about&lt;/a&gt; 3.1 million vehicles in China in 2019, down 15% on 2018. The Detroit-based firm’s slump has been exacerbated by the trade war with the U.S., and sales of its Buick and Chevrolet brands have taken a beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be tough for SAIC-GM-Wuling to maintain its No. 1 position but it can probably at least remain in the top three, according to Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s even despite the MINI EV not attracting any government subsidy because of its range of less than 250 kilometers. (Buyers who purchased an EV in China before July 1, 2019 used to receive a subsidy of 60,000 yuan, which itself has fallen to 21,000 yuan in 2020.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that the MINI EV, or cars of its ilk, could emerge as a replacement for the many low-speed electric vehicles (LSEV), a mode of transport that’s largely indigenous to China and that covers electric bikes and tricycles. In 2018, about 45.4 million LSEVs were produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSEVs are used mainly in rural areas or by elderly residents in cities who want to travel short distances around the neighborhood for shopping and errands. Under the current regulatory framework, there aren’t any rules governing the production and sale of electric vehicles with top speeds below 100 kilometers per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result has been a proliferation of cheap, poorly made EVs powered by polluting lead batteries that pose a threat to road safety and the environment, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in 2016. The ministry said later that it has been working on regulatory frame work governing this category of product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a huge market for EV makers to grab,” Zhang said. “SAIC-GM-Wuling has made it possible to sell its EV at a competitive price against gasoline cars without any government subsidy. That’s some milestone. It’s testimony to their strength on cost control and supply-chain management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers like Zhang Wu are also impressed. Zhang, a retired factory worker in his late 60s, drives a LSEV with no branding or bells and whistles to speak of. It cost 13,000 yuan and he uses it mainly to ferry his grandson to school and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;story-element story-element-text&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MINI EV “looks way better than my car,” said Zhang, who lives in a suburb in Beijing’s outskirts. “I always &lt;span id=&quot;79c2be52-ff17-11ea-815b-000f535060b0&quot;&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt; a bit nervous in this low-speed car because it’s kind of shaky.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
