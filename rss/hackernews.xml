<title>I Grew Up Gifted, but My Life Didn’t Turn Out the Way I Expected</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s a shame Heather never did anything with her life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casual comment from a family member to my dad stings to this day. I was about 30 at the time, and my husband, young son and I were living in my parents’ house. We had moved in while I was enduring a difficult pregnancy and had decided to stay for a few years after. I was working as a daycare teacher. The comment wasn’t meant to imply that I was a degenerate. This family member was voicing the feelings that have so often haunted me in my adult life – I wasn’t living up to my potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential. It’s a word I started hearing in toddlerhood. My parents noticed there was something different about me early on, and those observations were validated when I received a gifted designation at age five. The school suggested I skip grade one, which my parents declined. I started a part-time gifted program instead, and then transitioned into a full-time gifted class in Grade 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll Also Love:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/why-im-sending-my-child-to-forest-school-and-not-kindergarten&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why I'm Sending My Child To Forest School And Not Kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought being gifted was setting me up for success in life. Everything, at least academically, came very easily to me. I was bombarded with comments about how smart I was and how I would certainly be going places and achieving great success in life. I believed it. After all, everything I touched turned to gold. As fellow former gifted child Adam Smith (name changed), 42, put it, “I certainly remember feeling that school was easy, and that concept of ease affected my world view. Since school was preparation for life, [then] life must be easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the protection of academia, I became intensely aware that I had never learned how to work for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first hint that this was a skewed view came in university. I very quickly learned that, while I may have been the “best” in all of my high school classes, I was now in a place where my peers had been the “best” in theirs as well — and in most cases, their best was better than mine. This realization automatically dulled some of my drive to succeed. I would never gain the admiration and accolades I had received my whole life up until this point, so where was the desire to try? Still, I managed to get by receiving relatively good grades without an extreme amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real life hit me like a tidal wave. Outside the protection of academia, I became intensely aware that I had never learned how to work for things. Enough things came easily to me that if I wasn’t good at it, I simply didn’t do it. I’ve learned in speaking with other people who were deemed gifted as children that this is a common occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terri Moore, 36, said, “I think the fact that academically things came easily to me, and the praise I got for my academics, made me resistant to anything that needed practice. I never got ‘really good’ at anything as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Kimont, 38, speaks of a similar experience. “The fact that I can be immediately good at something has left me as a jack-of-all-trades and master of none, so to speak, and left me rather adrift when it came to finding my life’s purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That so many gifted children begin to view anything that requires work as not worth the effort takes its toll on us as adults. What was an asset in my school years became a hindrance to me in the real world. I watched the peers who I used to view, often smugly, as “average,” achieve far greater personal and professional success than I after graduation. They had learned the value of working towards a goal, and the skills to succeed at it. I had not. They weren’t afraid to try new things, whereas my fear of failure – something I didn’t have a lot of experience with as a child – held me back from making the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear prompted me to stay in what had been my summer job for over a decade past university graduation. I had the education to land a higher-paying, high-prestige job, but I didn’t have the drive or the courage that benefitted my former peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feelings of personal failure were compounded by the disappointments of people who genuinely expected me to, in their words, “do better” in life. This, too, is common among former gifted children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so long, being gifted was viewed simply as an asset  — something that made life easier, ignoring the ways in which it can hinder a child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Bragg-Larocque, 38, describes her experience with this phenomenon. “I feel like when people knew I was identified as being gifted they seemed to expect me to be more successful, or choose a more challenging career. I have been made to feel like a failure or like I wasted my potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimont empathizes. “Living up to my ‘potential’ has been a lifelong struggle. It is the absolute worst thing about being labeled gifted. It instilled pathological perfectionism and crippling anxiety, which both contributed to my concurrent lifelong struggle with depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While plenty of gifted children go on to thrive as adults, the fact that so many of us struggle is enough to reconsider how we handle giftedness. For so long, being gifted was viewed simply as an asset  — something that made life easier, ignoring the ways in which it can hinder a child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And A Little More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/its-not-just-adults-kids-struggle-impostor-syndrome-low-self-esteem-too&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It's Not Just Adults — Kids Struggle With Imposter Syndrome And Low Self-Esteem Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now my son is the one being labelled &quot;gifted,&quot; I’m often met with confusion when I express concern over that fact. It’s frequently viewed as a humblebrag. How could anyone not be happy that their child is gifted? But I know the challenges he is going to face. I know how there will come a day when he trades in easy grades for hard life lessons. I know that his brilliant brain will try to confuse and confound him. I worry about him the same way I worry about my other neuro-atypical child with ADHD. It’s hard not being “normal,” even if that difference includes being intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pledge to my gifted son is that I will never allow him to settle for easy, just because he can. I will make sure he experiences trials and failures and ensure that he practices getting back up. I will watch for those “extras” that can come with giftedness, and I won’t allow his intelligence to mask them. And I will never, ever shame him for not reaching a potential I pre-determined for him.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Betrayed by an app she had never heard of</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Photo by Roger H. Goun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe is an investigative journalist working for an international broadcast service; we will call the TV show she works for The Inquirer. She travels around the world to work with local journalists on uncovering stories that make the headlines: from human trafficking to drug cartels and government corruption. While her documentaries are watched by many and inspire change in the countries she works in, you would not know who Chloe is if we were to tell you her real name. That is because Chloe works hard to protect her anonymity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe does not appear on screen and has a very restricted use of social media. No one would know from searching her name that she works for The Inquirer. She values this anonymity, which allows her to approach sources without raising suspicions or concerns. When necessary, it also allows her to engage in undercover reporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In February 2019, Chloe travels to a country in West Africa. She expects to be there for a while and knows she will have to return many times over the course of the year. She needs to gain the trust of several sources who are in extremely vulnerable positions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon arriving in the country, Chloe buys a local SIM card. She will be using this to communicate with her sources. She has carefully considered her threat model and she knows that, in this particular case, the people she is investigating are not state actors and have no tech resources. She is therefore reassured she does not need to worry about state surveillance of her communications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe starts working. She makes phone calls to her sources telling them clearly who she is, who she works for and what she is trying to achieve. One day, Chloe needs to meet with a source. She uses her local phone to order a cab from a cab company. Her number is shared with the driver, who calls her to confirm he has arrived. When she enters the cab, the driver greets her “So… you work for The Inquirer?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The driver points at his phone. Her number is registered on the driver’s phone as “Chloe The Inquirer Journalist.” Chloe takes a picture of the phone, leaves the car and calls the information security team at The Inquirer to try and find out what has happened and how she has been exposed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The infosec team immediately identifies the culprit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe’s story is not one of mass state surveillance or a targeted attack. Chloe’s story reveals the much more pernicious way the apps we cherish can endanger not only us but those around us who may be in vulnerable situations. In fact, Chloe was betrayed by an app she had never even heard of: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truecaller.com/&quot;&gt;TrueCaller&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrruLHHhRrk&quot;&gt;TrueCaller is an app particularly popular in India&lt;/a&gt; (the app’s biggest market and the company’s headquarters) and Sub-Saharan Africa. TrueCaller identifies the numbers calling you, so you can filter out undesirable phone calls and make sure you pick up a call you have been expecting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r12OvTFymmc&quot;&gt;even if you have not previously registered the number&lt;/a&gt;. Every time a user makes or receives a phone call from a number not already in the TrueCaller database, TrueCaller offers the user the option to “tag” the number so it can be entered in the TrueCaller database, under the name entered by the user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happened to Chloe is that one of her sources was using TrueCaller. She called her source and after they hung up, TrueCaller offered the source the option to tag Chloe’s number, since the number was not in their database. The source did not see the potential for harm and tagged Chloe’s number as “Chloe The Inquirer Journalist.” Now every time Chloe makes a phone call using that phone number, her name appears to TrueCaller users, like the cab driver, as “Chloe The Inquirer Journalist.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thankfully for Chloe, she was not in a country actively hostile to journalists. She knows though that in a different country the consequences could have been much more serious if her affiliation had been known. She could have easily been flagged to the authorities. And it is not just her who would have been at risk, but her sources as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe also says that even in countries thought to be safe for journalists there is a risk of retaliation from people upset about the work the Inquirer is doing, when a journalist, like her, is exposed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While TrueCaller may have laudable intentions, the privacy implications for people who end up in their database raise concerns. When a number is tagged, the person who is tagged ends up having their name and phone number stored on the TrueCaller database, despite not having consented – or even being aware – that their data was collected. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A look at TrueCaller’s website shows two privacy policies – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truecaller.com/privacy-policy#eu&quot;&gt;one for their users based in the European Union&lt;/a&gt; (overseen by TrueCaller’s Swedish office) who are therefore protected by the EU &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacyinternational.org/topics/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truecaller.com/privacy-policy#row&quot;&gt;one for those who don’t&lt;/a&gt; and may live in countries with weaker or no data protection regulations. India, where TrueCaller is headquartered, &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacyinternational.org/advocacy-briefing/2324/privacy-internationals-comments-india-personal-data-protection-bill-2018&quot;&gt;is developing but still does not have a comprehensive data protection framework&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond the different standards applied to people within and outside of the European Union – &lt;a href=&quot;https://privacyinternational.org/feature/2677/we-need-fix-data-wild-west&quot;&gt;a phenomenon that Privacy International has called out in other companies&lt;/a&gt; – the larger issue remains that people who are tagged are not protected since these privacy policies only explicitly protect TrueCaller users; little to no information is provided as to how they apply to non-users tagged by the app’s users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in 2017, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/phV3TZvMTL&quot;&gt;Article 29 Working Party&lt;/a&gt;, an independent European advisory body on data protection and privacy (&lt;/span&gt;now replaced by the European Data Protection Board under the EU General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;span&gt;, had already questioned TrueCaller’s compliance with data protection laws precisely because they process non-users’ data without their consent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We contacted TrueCaller to ask them about the current safeguard in place for people who are not TrueCaller users. In their reply they brought to our attention the option offered to non-users to “unlist” themselves. By unlisting oneself, a non-user prevents TrueCaller from adding their number into the database. While this would not have helped Chloe, or anyone whose number has already been entered without their knowledge, this is a valuable option that we wish would be more clearly advertise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We reply to TrueCaller to suggest that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They advertise the unlisting option more clearly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They send a SMS to any non-user whose number is entered to warn them someone is attempting to enter their number and ask them for consent. This would also be an opportunity to inform them about the unlisting option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;TrueCaller acknowledged our response but did not show an interest in following those steps, which we believe would contribute greatly to protecting the privacy and making TrueCaller a safer app for all. You can read our exchange with TrueCaller below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chloe’s story shows the concrete risks that TrueCaller presents for people in vulnerable situations. We appreciate that an app like TrueCaller can have positives. However, it can also put people at risk, as this case study illustrates. We will carry on monitoring cases of harm caused by TrueCaller and other similar applications and campaign for better privacy protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have been affected by TrueCaller or a similar application, tell us your story by writing to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eva@privacyinternational.org&quot;&gt;eva@privacyinternational.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Apple contacted Qualcomm as a potential supplier for modem chips in the first iPhone. Qualcomm's response was unusual: a letter demanding that Apple sign a patent licensing agreement before Qualcomm would even consider supplying chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd spent 20 years in the industry, I had never seen a letter like this,&quot; said Tony Blevins, Apple's vice president of procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most suppliers are eager to talk to new customers—especially customers as big and prestigious as Apple. But Qualcomm wasn't like other suppliers; it enjoyed a dominant position in the market for cellular chips. That gave Qualcomm a lot of leverage, and the company wasn't afraid to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blevins' comments came when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1334169#&quot;&gt;testified earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in the Federal Trade Commission's blockbuster antitrust case against Qualcomm. The FTC &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/feds-sue-qualcomm-for-anti-competitive-patent-licensing/&quot;&gt;filed this lawsuit in 2017&lt;/a&gt; partly at the urging of Apple, which had chafed under Qualcomm's wireless chip dominance for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a California federal judge provided the FTC and Apple with sweet vindication. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.306945/gov.uscourts.cand.306945.1490.0.pdf&quot;&gt;scathing 233-page opinion&lt;/a&gt; [PDF], Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm's aggressive licensing tactics had violated American antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read every word of Judge Koh's book-length opinion, which portrays Qualcomm as a ruthless monopolist. The legal document outlines a nearly 20-year history of overcharging smartphone makers for cellular chips. Qualcomm structured its contracts with smartphone makers in ways that made it almost impossible for other chipmakers to challenge Qualcomm's dominance. Customers who didn't go along with Qualcomm's one-sided terms were threatened with an abrupt and crippling loss of access to modem chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Qualcomm has monopoly power over certain cell phone chips, and they use that monopoly power to charge people too much money,&quot; says Charles Duan, a patent expert at the free-market R Street Institute. &quot;Instead of just charging more for the chips themselves, they required people to buy a patent license and overcharged for the patent license.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of that dominance might be coming to an end. In her ruling, Koh ordered Qualcomm to stop threatening customers with chip cutoffs. Qualcomm must now re-negotiate all of its agreements with customers and license its patents to competitors on reasonable terms. And if Koh's ruling survives the appeals process, it could produce a truly competitive market for wireless chips for the first time in this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm’s perfect profit machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3592008599_2153558597_o.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;960&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3592008599_2153558597_o-640x480.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3592008599_2153558597_o-1280x960.jpg 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Different cellular networks operate on different wireless networking standards, and these standards change every few years. For much of the last 20 years, Qualcomm has enjoyed a lead—and in some cases a stranglehold—on chips that support major cellular standards. So if a smartphone company aspired to sell its wares around the world, it had little choice but to do business with Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the early 2010s Qualcomm enjoyed a big lead on chips for the CDMA standards favored by Verizon and Sprint in the US and some other carriers overseas. Qualcomm Chief Technology Officer James Thompson bluntly explained in an internal 2014 email to CEO Steve Mollenkopf how this gave the company leverage over Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are the only supplier today that can give them a global launch,&quot; Thompson wrote, according to court documents. &quot;In fact, without us they would lose big parts of North America, Japan and China. That would really hurt them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just Apple. BlackBerry was in a similar predicament around 2010. In a deposition, BlackBerry executive John Grubbs stated that without access to Qualcomm's chips, &quot;30 percent of our device sales would have gone away overnight if we couldn't have supplied CDMA devices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, Qualcomm has had deals in place with most of the leading cell phone makers, including LG, Sony, Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Lenovo, ZTE, and Nokia. These deals gave Qualcomm enormous leverage over these companies—leverage that allowed Qualcomm to extract patent royalty rates that were far higher than those earned by other companies with similar patent portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm's patent licensing fees were calculated based on the value of the entire phone, not just the value of chips that embodied Qualcomm's patented technology. This effectively meant that Qualcomm got a cut of every component of a smartphone—most of which had nothing to do with Qualcomm's cellular patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Qualcomm charges us more than everybody else put together,&quot; Apple executive Jeff Williams said. &quot;We've never seen such a significant licensing fee tied to any other IP we license,&quot; said Motorola's Todd Madderom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal Qualcomm documents supported these claims. One showed that Qualcomm's patent licensing operation brought in $7.7 billion in 2016—more than the combined patent licensing revenue of 12 other companies with significant patent portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No license, no chips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/snapdragon-8cx-compute-platform-chip-front.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;2266&quot; data-width=&quot;3654&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/snapdragon-8cx-compute-platform-chip-front-640x397.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/snapdragon-8cx-compute-platform-chip-front-1280x794.jpg 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These high royalties reflected an unusual negotiating tactic called &quot;no license, no chips.&quot; No one could buy Qualcomm's cellular chips unless they first signed a license to Qualcomm's patent portfolio. And the terms of these patent deals were heavily tilted in Qualcomm's favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a phone maker had signed its first deal with Qualcomm, Qualcomm gained even more leverage. Qualcomm had the right to unilaterally terminate a smartphone maker's chip supply once the patent licensing deal expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we are unable to source the modem, we are unable to ship the handset,&quot; said Motorola executive Todd Madderom in a deposition. &quot;It takes many months of engineering work to design a replacement solution, if there is even a viable one on the market that supports the need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made Qualcomm's customers extremely vulnerable as they neared the expiration of a patent licensing deal. If a customer tried to negotiate more favorable terms—to say nothing of formally challenging Qualcomm's patent claims in court—Qualcomm could abruptly cut off the company's chip supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We explained that we were contemplating terminating the license,&quot; Lenovo executive Ira Blumberg testified during the trial. A senior Qualcomm executive &quot;was very calm about it, and said we should feel free to do that, but if we did, we would no longer be able to purchase Qualcomm chips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're looking at months and months, if not a year or more, without supply,&quot; Blumberg said in a deposition. That &quot;would be, if not fatal, then nearly fatal to almost any company in this business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Koh found that Qualcomm used this tactic over and over again over the last 20 years: Qualcomm threatened to cut off Samsung's chip supply in 2001, LG's chip supply in 2004, Sony and ZTE's chip supplies in 2012, Huawei and Lenovo's chip supplies in 2013, and Motorola's chip supply in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm’s chip deals boxed out competitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/getty-phone-encryption.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;1414&quot; data-width=&quot;2121&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/getty-phone-encryption-640x427.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/getty-phone-encryption-1280x853.jpg 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An obvious question is how Qualcomm maintained its stranglehold over the supply of modem chips. Partly, Qualcomm employed talented engineers and spent billions of dollars keeping its chips on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm also bolstered its dominant position by selling systems on a chip that included a CPU and other functions as well as modem functionality. This yielded significant cost and power savings, and it was hard for smaller chipmakers to compete with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But besides these technical reasons, Qualcomm also structured its agreements with customers to make it difficult for other companies to break into the cellular modem chip business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm's first weapon against competitors: patent licensing terms requiring customers to pay a royalty on every phone sold—not just phones that contained Qualcomm's wireless chips. This gave Qualcomm an inherent advantage in competition with other chipmakers. If another chipmaker tried to undercut Qualcomm's chips on price, Qualcomm could easily afford to cut the price of its own chips, knowing that the customer would still be paying Qualcomm a hefty patent licensing fee on every phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Koh draws a direct parallel to licensing behavior that got Microsoft in legal trouble in the 1990s. Microsoft would offer PC makers a discount if they agreed to pay Microsoft a licensing fee for every PC sold—whether or not the PC shipped with a copy of MS-DOS. This effectively meant that a PC maker had to pay twice if it shipped a PC running a non-Microsoft operating system. In 1999, a federal judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/87/1244/2307586/&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that a reasonable jury could conclude this arrangement violated antitrust law by making it difficult for Microsoft's competitors to break into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of Qualcomm's licensing deals included terms that explicitly discouraged companies from using non-Qualcomm wireless chips. Qualcomm would offer cell phone makers rebates on every Qualcomm chip they sold. But cell phone makers would only get those rebates if they used Qualcomm chips for at least 85 percent—or in some cases even 100 percent—of the phones they sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Apple signed a deal with Qualcomm in 2013 that effectively guaranteed that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm's wireless chips. Under the deal, Qualcomm paid Apple hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates and marketing incentives between 2013 and 2016. However, Qualcomm would stop making those payments if Apple started selling an iPhone or iPad with a non-Qualcomm cellular chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was even required to pay back some of those funds if it used non-Qualcomm cellular chips before February 2016. One internal Qualcomm email calculated that Apple would owe $645 million if it launched an iPhone with a non-Qualcomm cellular chip in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm made similar deals with other major cell phone makers. In 2003, Qualcomm signed a 10-year deal granting Huawei a reduced royalty rate of 2.65 percent if Huawei purchased 100 percent of its CDMA chips for the Chinese market from Qualcomm. If Huawei bought non-Qualcomm CDMA chips, the royalty rate jumped to five percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2004 deal gave LG rebates if LG purchased at least 85 percent of its CDMA chips from Qualcomm. The deal also required LG to pay a higher patent royalty rate when it sold phones with non-Qualcomm cellular chips. A 2018 deal makes incentive payments to Samsung if the company buys 100 percent of its &quot;premium&quot; cellular chips from Qualcomm—as well as lower thresholds (the exact percentages are redacted) for lower-tier chips.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Your office may be secured, but you will eventually have to receive external people for a party or a meeting. Someone with physical access to an employee computer can do a lot of harm in a very short amount of time, so locking all computers is a great habit. If you get in the habit of locking your machine at the office, you’ll be unlikely to forget to also do it in a Starbucks or at a meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organizations make it a game to catch fellow employees’ computers unlocked. This is a good way to reinforce the habit of locking your computer for everyone. At Sqreen, for example, if someone catches another person’s laptop unlocked while they’re AFK, they can type “Cookies!” in that person’s Slack. That person will then have to bring in cookies for the office!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Block Fingerprinting with Firefox</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you wonder why you keep seeing the same ad, over and over, the answer could be fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting is a type of online tracking that’s different from cookies or ordinary trackers. This digital fingerprint is created when a company makes a unique profile of your computer, software, add-ons, and even preferences. Your settings like the screen you use, the fonts installed on your computer, and even your choice of a web browser can all be used to create a fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1418&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;660&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting.png 1200w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting-300x165.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting-768x422.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting-600x330.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/fingerprinting-1000x550.png 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have commonly used settings and programs, it becomes harder to tie your fingerprint to your computer, but, if you install unique add-ons, you’ll be easier to find. Marketers can use it to bombard you with annoying ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to stop using the internet to escape the ads, and you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/?utm_source=blog.mozilla.org&amp;amp;utm_campaign=firefox_frontier&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; has a new feature that can help you block fingerprinting coming from many ad trackers. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top left of your &lt;a&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; browser, you will see an icon that looks like an i inside a circle. Click on it and then click on Content Blocking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the Custom section. You’ll see boxes you can click to block trackers, cookies, fingerprinting, and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the box next to Fingerprinters, and you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1380&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/firefox/files/2019/05/Fingerprinting-settings-screen_EN-600x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;469&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/Fingerprinting-settings-screen_EN-600x469.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/Fingerprinting-settings-screen_EN-300x235.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/files/2019/05/Fingerprinting-settings-screen_EN.png 720w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that blocking fingerprinting may cause some sites to break. The website might look strange, or the layout will be different. Besides tracking you without your permission, fingerprinting can slow down your online experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A lot of the scripts that are run to enable tracking delay webpage load times while all these tracking scripts fire and run in the background,” said Peter Dolanjski, Firefox Product Lead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably wouldn’t appreciate someone tracking your moves in real life. There’s no reason to accept it online. If you don’t already have Firefox, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/&quot;&gt;click here to download&lt;/a&gt; and protect yourself from digital fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Better Bash History (2012)</title>
<link>https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/better-bash-history/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/better-bash-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;By default, the Bash shell keeps the history of your most recent session in the &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; file, and the commands you’ve issued in your current session are also available with a &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; call. These defaults are useful for keeping track of what you’ve been up to in the shell on any given machine, but with disks much larger and faster than they were when Bash was designed, a little tweaking in your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file can record history more permanently, consistently, and usefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Append history instead of rewriting it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should start by setting the &lt;code&gt;histappend&lt;/code&gt; option, which will mean that when you close a session, your history will be &lt;em&gt;appended&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; file rather than overwriting what’s in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;shopt -s histappend
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allow a larger history file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default maximum number of commands saved into the &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; file is a rather meager 500. If you want to keep history further back than a few weeks or so, you may as well bump this up by explicitly setting &lt;code&gt;$HISTSIZE&lt;/code&gt; to a much larger number in your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;. We can do the same thing with the &lt;code&gt;$HISTFILESIZE&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HISTFILESIZE=1000000
HISTSIZE=1000000
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; page for Bash says that &lt;code&gt;HISTFILESIZE&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;unset&lt;/code&gt; to stop truncation entirely, but unfortunately this &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2009-02/msg00108.html&quot;&gt;doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; files due to the order in which variables are set; it’s therefore more straightforward to simply set it to a very large number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a machine with resource constraints, it might be a good idea to occasionally archive old &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; files to speed up login and reduce memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t store specific lines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can prevent commands that start with a space from going into history by setting &lt;code&gt;$HISTCONTROL&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ignorespace&lt;/code&gt;. You can also ignore duplicate commands, for example repeated &lt;code&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; calls to watch a file grow, by adding &lt;code&gt;ignoredups&lt;/code&gt;. There’s a shorthand to set both in &lt;code&gt;ignoreboth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also want to remove the use of certain commands from your history, whether for privacy or readability reasons. This can be done with the &lt;code&gt;$HISTIGNORE&lt;/code&gt; variable. It’s common to use this to exclude &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; calls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/bash-job-control/&quot;&gt;job control&lt;/a&gt; builtins like &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt;, and calls to &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HISTIGNORE='ls:bg:fg:history'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record timestamps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set &lt;code&gt;$HISTTIMEFORMAT&lt;/code&gt; to something useful, Bash will record the timestamp of each command in its history. In this variable you can specify the format in which you want this timestamp displayed when viewed with &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt;. I find the full date and time to be useful, because it can be sorted easily and works well with tools like &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T '
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use one command per line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make your &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; file a little easier to parse, you can force commands that you entered on more than one line to be adjusted to fit on only one with the &lt;code&gt;cmdhist&lt;/code&gt; option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;shopt -s cmdhist
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Store history immediately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Bash only records a session to the &lt;code&gt;.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; file on disk when the session terminates. This means that if you crash or your session terminates improperly, you lose the history up to that point. You can fix this by recording each line of history as you issue it, through the &lt;code&gt;$PROMPT_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;related-posts&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;related-posts-MRP_all&quot; class=&quot;related-posts-type&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Switch from Chrome to Firefox</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/switch/</guid>
<description>&lt;header readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tagline&quot;&gt;Switching to Firefox is fast, easy and risk-free. Firefox imports your bookmarks, autofills, passwords and preferences from Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select what to take from Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let Firefox do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the web faster, all set up for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;download-button-desktop-release&quot; class=&quot;download-button mzp-c-button-download-container&quot; readability=&quot;6.0452418096724&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unrecognized-download&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your system may not meet the requirements for Firefox, but you can try one of these versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;download download-dumb&quot; readability=&quot;2.6168224299065&quot;&gt;
&lt;p role=&quot;heading&quot; class=&quot;download-heading&quot;&gt;Download Firefox — English (US)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;unsupported-download&quot;&gt;Your system doesn't meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/system-requirements/&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; to run Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;unsupported-download-osx&quot;&gt;Your system doesn't meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-osx&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; to run Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;linux-arm-download&quot;&gt;Please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/kb/install-firefox-linux&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to install Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer readability=&quot;3.9558232931727&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Firefox and still have Chrome. Chrome won’t change on your machine one bit. Share with your friends how to switch to Firefox&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pi-hole: A black hole for Internet advertisements</title>
<link>https://pi-hole.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pi-hole.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;features-coloured-icon-boxes-featurecol cp3cols color6&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Network-wide protection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead of browser plugins or other software on each computer, &lt;strong&gt;install Pi-hole in one place&lt;/strong&gt; and your entire network is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;features-coloured-icon-boxes-featurecol cp3cols&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Block in-app advertisements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Network-level blocking allows you to &lt;strong&gt;block ads in non-traditional places&lt;/strong&gt; such as mobile apps and smart TVs, regardless of hardware or OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;features-coloured-icon-boxes-featurecol cp3cols&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improve network performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since &lt;strong&gt;advertisements are blocked &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they are downloaded&lt;/strong&gt;, network performance is improved and will feel faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;features-coloured-icon-boxes-featurecol cp3cols&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Monitor statistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Web interface offers control of your Pi-hole and a central place to view statistics.  We also include an API for extending these stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
