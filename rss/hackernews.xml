<title>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it</title>
<link>https://personal.jatan.space/2020/09/05/ubuntu-snap-obsession-has-snapped-me-off-of-it/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://personal.jatan.space/2020/09/05/ubuntu-snap-obsession-has-snapped-me-off-of-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article has been updated to accommodate changes since the original four months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt; features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1378&quot; width=&quot;409&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; srcset=&quot;https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=409 409w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=300 300w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software center can’t install Flatpak apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt; app. The new snapped store can handle management of &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt; applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users wanting to install Flatpak apps &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/&quot;&gt;need to revert to using the .deb version&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browsing the Snap Store sucks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow and forced Chromium snap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No control over updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark&quot;&gt;discussion on the Ubuntu forums&lt;/a&gt; on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the &lt;em&gt;full thread&lt;/em&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/&quot;&gt;Silverblue&lt;/a&gt;, and only swap the default when it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those on Linux, I recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pop.system76.com/&quot;&gt;Pop!_OS 20.04&lt;/a&gt; instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. &lt;a href=&quot;https://elementary.io/&quot;&gt;elementary OS&lt;/a&gt; is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://appcenter.elementary.io/&quot;&gt;app ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/&quot;&gt;excellent file manager&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/&quot;&gt;welcoming nature&lt;/a&gt; of their developers for contributions and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Are you an anarchist? The answer may surprise you (2000)</title>
<link>https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-are-you-an-anarchist-the-answer-may-surprise-you</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-are-you-an-anarchist-the-answer-may-surprise-you</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Chances are you have already heard something about who anarchists are and what they are supposed to believe. Chances are almost everything you have heard is nonsense. Many people seem to think that anarchists are proponents of violence, chaos, and destruction, that they are against all forms of order and organization, or that they are crazed nihilists who just want to blow everything up. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Anarchists are simply people who believe human beings are capable of behaving in a reasonable fashion without having to be forced to. It is really a very simple notion. But it’s one that the rich and powerful have always found extremely dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their very simplest, anarchist beliefs turn on to two elementary assumptions. The first is that human beings are, under ordinary circumstances, about as reasonable and decent as they are allowed to be, and can organize themselves and their communities without needing to be told how. The second is that power corrupts. Most of all, anarchism is just a matter of having the courage to take the simple principles of common decency that we all live by, and to follow them through to their logical conclusions. Odd though this may seem, in most important ways you are probably already an anarchist — you just don’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by taking a few examples from everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes”, then you are used to acting like an anarchist! The most basic anarchist principle is self-organization: the assumption that human beings do not need to be threatened with prosecution in order to be able to come to reasonable understandings with each other, or to treat each other with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone believes they are capable of behaving reasonably themselves. If they think laws and police are necessary, it is only because they don’t believe that other people are. But if you think about it, don’t those people all feel exactly the same way about you? Anarchists argue that almost all the anti-social behavior which makes us think it’s necessary to have armies, police, prisons, and governments to control our lives, is actually caused by the systematic inequalities and injustice those armies, police, prisons and governments make possible. It’s all a vicious circle. If people are used to being treated like their opinions do not matter, they are likely to become angry and cynical, even violent — which of course makes it easy for those in power to say that their opinions do not matter. Once they understand that their opinions really do matter just as much as anyone else’s, they tend to become remarkably understanding. To cut a long story short: anarchists believe that for the most part it is power itself, and the effects of power, that make people stupid and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes”, then you belong to an organization which works on anarchist principles! Another basic anarchist principle is voluntary association. This is simply a matter of applying democratic principles to ordinary life. The only difference is that anarchists believe it should be possible to have a society in which everything could be organized along these lines, all groups based on the free consent of their members, and therefore, that all top-down, military styles of organization like armies or bureaucracies or large corporations, based on chains of command, would no longer be necessary. Perhaps you don’t believe that would be possible. Perhaps you do. But every time you reach an agreement by consensus, rather than threats, every time you make a voluntary arrangement with another person, come to an understanding, or reach a compromise by taking due consideration of the other person’s particular situation or needs, you are being an anarchist — even if you don’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchism is just the way people act when they are free to do as they choose, and when they deal with others who are equally free — and therefore aware of the responsibility to others that entails. This leads to another crucial point: that while people can be reasonable and considerate when they are dealing with equals, human nature is such that they cannot be trusted to do so when given power over others. Give someone such power, they will almost invariably abuse it in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes”, then you subscribe to the anarchist critique of today’s society — at least, in its broadest outlines. Anarchists believe that power corrupts and those who spend their entire lives seeking power are the very last people who should have it. Anarchists believe that our present economic system is more likely to reward people for selfish and unscrupulous behavior than for being decent, caring human beings. Most people feel that way. The only difference is that most people don’t think there’s anything that can be done about it, or anyway — and this is what the faithful servants of the powerful are always most likely to insist — anything that won’t end up making things even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if that weren’t true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And is there really any reason to believe this? When you can actually test them, most of the usual predictions about what would happen without states or capitalism turn out to be entirely untrue. For thousands of years people lived without governments. In many parts of the world people live outside of the control of governments today. They do not all kill each other. Mostly they just get on about their lives the same as anyone else would. Of course, in a complex, urban, technological society all this would be more complicated: but technology can also make all these problems a lot easier to solve. In fact, we have not even begun to think about what our lives could be like if technology were really marshaled to fit human needs. How many hours would we really need to work in order to maintain a functional society — that is, if we got rid of all the useless or destructive occupations like telemarketers, lawyers, prison guards, financial analysts, public relations experts, bureaucrats and politicians, and turn our best scientific minds away from working on space weaponry or stock market systems to mechanizing away dangerous or annoying tasks like coal mining or cleaning the bathroom, and distribute the remaining work among everyone equally? Five hours a day? Four? Three? Two? Nobody knows because no one is even asking this kind of question. Anarchists think these are the very questions we should be asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter who started it.” “Two wrongs don’t make a right.” “Clean up your own mess.” “Do unto others...” “Don’t be mean to people just because they’re different.” Perhaps we should decide whether we’re lying to our children when we tell them about right and wrong, or whether we’re willing to take our own injunctions seriously. Because if you take these moral principles to their logical conclusions, you arrive at anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the principle that two wrongs don’t make a right. If you really took it seriously, that alone would knock away almost the entire basis for war and the criminal justice system. The same goes for sharing: we’re always telling children that they have to learn to share, to be considerate of each other’s needs, to help each other; then we go off into the real world where we assume that everyone is naturally selfish and competitive. But an anarchist would point out: in fact, what we say to our children is right. Pretty much every great worthwhile achievement in human history, every discovery or accomplishment that’s improved our lives, has been based on cooperation and mutual aid; even now, most of us spend more of our money on our friends and families than on ourselves; while likely as not there will always be competitive people in the world, there’s no reason why society has to be based on encouraging such behavior, let alone making people compete over the basic necessities of life. That only serves the interests of people in power, who want us to live in fear of one another. That’s why anarchists call for a society based not only on free association but mutual aid. The fact is that most children grow up believing in anarchist morality, and then gradually have to realize that the adult world doesn’t really work that way. That’s why so many become rebellious, or alienated, even suicidal as adolescents, and finally, resigned and bitter as adults; their only solace, often, being the ability to raise children of their own and pretend to them that the world is fair. But what if we really could start to build a world which really was at least founded on principles of justice? Wouldn’t that be the greatest gift to one’s children one could possibly give?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that human beings are fundamentally corrupt and evil, or that certain sorts of people (women, people of color, ordinary folk who are not rich or highly educated) are inferior specimens, destined to be ruled by their betters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you answered “yes”, then, well, it looks like you aren’t an anarchist after all. But if you answered “no”, then chances are you already subscribe to 90% of anarchist principles, and, likely as not, are living your life largely in accord with them. Every time you treat another human with consideration and respect, you are being an anarchist. Every time you work out your differences with others by coming to reasonable compromise, listening to what everyone has to say rather than letting one person decide for everyone else, you are being an anarchist. Every time you have the opportunity to force someone to do something, but decide to appeal to their sense of reason or justice instead, you are being an anarchist. The same goes for every time you share something with a friend, or decide who is going to do the dishes, or do anything at all with an eye to fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might object that all this is well and good as a way for small groups of people to get on with each other, but managing a city, or a country, is an entirely different matter. And of course there is something to this. Even if you decentralize society and put as much power as possible in the hands of small communities, there will still be plenty of things that need to be coordinated, from running railroads to deciding on directions for medical research. But just because something is complicated does not mean there is no way to do it democratically. It would just be complicated. In fact, anarchists have all sorts of different ideas and visions about how a complex society might manage itself. To explain them though would go far beyond the scope of a little introductory text like this. Suffice it to say, first of all, that a lot of people have spent a lot of time coming up with models for how a really democratic, healthy society might work; but second, and just as importantly, no anarchist claims to have a perfect blueprint. The last thing we want is to impose prefab models on society anyway. The truth is we probably can’t even imagine half the problems that will come up when we try to create a democratic society; still, we’re confident that, human ingenuity being what it is, such problems can always be solved, so long as it is in the spirit of our basic principles — which are, in the final analysis, simply the principles of fundamental human decency.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Talk – A free group video call app with screen sharing</title>
<link>https://github.com/vasanthv/talk</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/vasanthv/talk</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;A free group video call app with screen sharing.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is built using WebRTC, so all your video chat is peer-to-peer. Group video call is achieved using WebRTC mesh. So the quality of the call is inversely proportional to the number of people on the call. The sweet number is somewhere around 6 to 8 people in an average high-speed connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Node.js 8.x or above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Build this app locally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the repo locally, or extract the contents of the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/vasanthv/talk.git
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd talk&lt;/code&gt; and then install dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the following url in the browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LICENSE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Linux sysadmin course, eight years on</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24380969</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24380969</guid>
<description>Almost eight years ago I launched an online “Linux sysadmin course for newbies” here at HN.
&lt;p&gt;It was a side-project that went well, but never generated enough money to allow me to fully commit to leaving the Day Job. After surviving the Big C, and getting made redundant I thought I might improve and relaunch it commercially – but my doctors are a pessimistic bunch, so it looked like I didn’t have the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I rejigged/relaunched it via a Reddit forum this February as free and open - and have now gathered a team of helpers to ensure that it keeps going each month even after I can’t be involved any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a month-long course which restarts each month, so “Day 1” of September is this coming Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if you could pass the word on to anyone you know who may be the target market of those who: “...aspire to get Linux-related jobs in industry - junior Linux sysadmin, devops-related work and similar”.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of interest/hype around RISC-V, and low-cost boards such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/08/29/longan-nano-gd32v-risc-v-development-board-comes-with-lcd-display-and-enclosure/&quot;&gt;Longan Nano&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/08/21/getting-started-with-sipeed-m1-based-maixduino-board-grove-ai-hat-for-raspberry-pi/&quot;&gt;Maixduino&lt;/a&gt; are already available, but those are based on microcontroller-class chips, even though it’s possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/17/how-to-build-run-linux-on-kendryte-k210-risc-v-nommu-processor/&quot;&gt;run Linux on Kendryte K210 RISC-V board&lt;/a&gt;, it comes without MMU, so it’s not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux capable RISC-V boards do exist but cost several hundred dollars or more with the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/2018/02/04/sifive-introduces-hifive-unleashed-risc-v-linux-development-board-crowdfunding/&quot;&gt;HiFive Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/07/20/polarfire-soc-icicle-64-bit-risc-v-and-fpga-development-board-runs-linux-or-freebsd/&quot;&gt;PolarFire SoC Icicle&lt;/a&gt; development kit. If only there was a RISC-V board similar to the Raspberry Pi board and with a similar price point… The good news is that the RISC-V International Open Source (RIOS) Laboratory is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/rios-laboratory-and-imagination-announce-partnership-to-grow-the-risc-v-ecosystem/&quot;&gt;collaborating with Imagination technologies&lt;/a&gt; to bring PicoRio RISC-V SBC to market at a price point similar to Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript data-img=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg&quot; data-webp=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg.webp&quot; data-srcset-webp=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg.webp 1382w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-640x417.jpg.webp 640w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-1024x667.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-300x195.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-768x500.jpg.webp 768w&quot; data-srcset-img=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg 1382w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-640x417.jpg 640w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-1024x667.jpg 1024w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-768x500.jpg 768w&quot; data-alt=&quot;PicoRio Linux RISC-V SBC&quot; data-class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-80156&quot; data-height=&quot;469&quot; data-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&quot; data-width=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;ewww_webp&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-80156&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PicoRio Linux RISC-V SBC&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;469&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC.jpg 1382w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-640x417.jpg 640w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-1024x667.jpg 1024w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PicoRio-Linux-RISC-V-SBC-768x500.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&quot; data-eio=&quot;j&quot;/&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PicoRio board was presented at the RISC-V Global Forum on September 3rd.

<title>We didn&amp;#039;t encrypt your password, we hashed it</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;You've possibly just found out you're in a data breach. The organisation involved may have contacted you and advised your password was exposed but fortunately, they encrypted it. But you should change it anyway. Huh? Isn't the whole point of encryption that it protects data when exposed to unintended parties? Ah, yes, but it wasn't encrypted it was hashed and therein lies a key difference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;6.9677419354839&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Saying that passwords are “encrypted” over and over again doesn’t make it so. They’re bcrypt hashes so good job there, but the fact they’re suggesting everyone changes their password illustrates that even good hashing has its risks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/21V6Vte6Wa&quot;&gt;https://t.co/21V6Vte6Wa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1301253186599096320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this over and over again and I'm not just on some nerdy pedantic rant, the difference between encryption and hashing is fundamental to how at-risk your password is from being recovered and abused after a data breach. I often hear people excusing the mischaracterisation of password storage on the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/autobahn/status/1301255220329095173&quot;&gt;users not understanding what hashing means&lt;/a&gt;, but what I'm actually hearing is that breached organisations just aren't able to explain it in a way people understand. So here it is in a single sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A password hash is a representation of your password that can't be reversed, but the original password &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; still be determined if someone hashes it again and gets the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start to drill deeper in a way that can be understood by everyday normal people, beginning with what a password hash actually is: there are two defining attributes that are relevant to this discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A password hash is one-way: you can hash but you can never un-hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hashing procedure is deterministic: you will always get the same output with the same input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important for password storage as it means the following as they relate to the previous points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The original password is never stored thus keeping it a secret even from the website you provided it to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being deterministic, when the password is hashed at registration it will match the same password provided and hashed at login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the following password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P@ssw0rd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good password because it has lowercase, uppercase, numeric and non-alphanumeric values plus is 8 characters long. Yet somehow, your human brain looked at it and decided &quot;no, it's not a good password&quot; because what you're seeing is merely character substitution. The hackers have worked this out too which is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/&quot;&gt;arbitrary composition rules on websites are useless&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, here's what the hash of that password looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hash was created with the MD5 hashing algorithm and is 32 characters long. A shorter password hashed with MD5 is still 32 characters long. This entire blog post hashed with Md5 is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; 32 characters long. This helps demonstrate the fundamental difference between hashing and encryption: a hash is a &lt;em&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt; of data whilst encryption is &lt;em&gt;protected&lt;/em&gt; data. Encryption can be reversed if you have the key which is why it's used for everything from protecting the files on your device to your credit card number if you save it on a website you use to the contents of this page as it's sent over the internet. In each one of these cases, the data being protected needs to be retrieved in its original format at some point in the future hence the need for encryption. That's the fundamental difference with passwords: you never need to retrieve the password you provided to a website at registration, you only need to ensure it matches the one you provide at login hence the use of hashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where does hashing go wrong and why do websites still ask you to change your password when hashes are exposed? Here's an easy demo - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92&amp;amp;oq=161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.777j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;let's just Google the hash from above&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/MD5-hashes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we have a whole bunch of websites that match the original password with the hashed version. This is where the deterministic nature of hashes becomes a weakness rather than a strength because once the hash and the plain text version are matched to each other, you've now got a handy little searchable index. Another way of thinking about this is that password hashes are too predictable, so what do we do? Add randomness, which brings us to salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that if instead of just hashing the word &quot;P@ssw0rd&quot;, we added another dozen characters to it first - &lt;em&gt;totally random characters&lt;/em&gt; - and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; we hashed it. Someone else comes along and uses the same password and they get their own salt (which means their own collection of totally random characters) which gets added to the password then hashed. Even with the same password, when combined with a unique salt the resultant hash will, itself, also be unique. So long as the same salt used at registration is added to your password at login (and yes, this means storing the salt alongside the hash in a database somewhere), the process can be repeated and the website can confirm if the password is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is, if someone has all the data out of a database Wattpad style, can't they just reproduce the salting and hashing process? I mean you've got the salt and the hash sitting right there, what's to stop someone from having a great big list of passwords, picking a salt from the database then adding it to each password, hashing it and seeing if it matches the one from the breach? The only thing hampering this effort is time; how long would it take to hash that big list of passwords for one user's record from the database? How long for, in Wattpad's case, more than &lt;em&gt;a quarter of a billion&lt;/em&gt; users? That all depends on the hashing algorithm that's been chosen. Old, antiquated hashing algorithms that were never really designed for password storage in the first place can be calculated at a rate of tens of &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; per second on consumer-grade hardware. Yes, that's &quot;billion&quot; with a &quot;b&quot; for bravo and for the more technical folks, that's where you're at with MD5 or SHA-1. How long is a hashed password going to remain uncracked at that rate of guesses? Usually, not very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the example in the tweet at the start of this blog post, Wattpad didn't encrypt their customers' passwords, they hashed them. With bcrypt. This is a hashing algorithm designed for storing passwords and what really sets it apart from the aforementioned ones is that it's &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;. I mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; slow, like it takes tens of millions of times longer to create the hash. You don't notice this as a customer when you're registering on the site or logging on because it's still only a fraction of a second to calculate a hash of your password, but for someone attempting to &lt;em&gt;crack&lt;/em&gt; your password by hashing different possible examples and comparing them to the one in Wattpad, it makes life &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; harder. But not impossible...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me demonstrate: here's the Wattpad registration page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was interested in what the password criteria was so I entered a single character and was told that it must be at least 6. Righto, let's now check complexity requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will 6 all lowercase characters be allowed? Let's submit the registration form and find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-03_10-28-19.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/2020-09-03_10-28-19.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-03_10-28-19.png 629w&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep 😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem with this and it's all going to bring us back to Wattpad's earlier statement about changing your password: because Wattpad's entire password criteria appears to boil down to &quot;just make sure you have 6 or more characters&quot;, people are able to register using passwords like the one above. That particular password - &quot;passwo&quot; - appears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned's Pwned Password service&lt;/a&gt; 3,649 times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 968w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very poor password not because of a lack of numbers, uppercase or non-alphanumeric characters (I could easily make a very strong password that's all lowercase), but because of its predictability and prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with the knowledge that Wattpad allows very simple passwords, I took a small list of the most common ones that were 6 characters or longer and checked them against a sample of their bcrypt hashes. Let's consider a bcrypt hash like this, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$2y$10$5sqOeY.NDcW8vkr47BIG..PeSddwTT/Z8z0MwvF/92NSSh3UsxA.u&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plain text password that generated that hash is &quot;iloveyou&quot;. That's in Pwned Passwords 1.6M times and I would argue it's a rather risky one to allow. But because Wattpad's password criteria is so weak, someone (probably many people) used that password and it was easily cracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$2y$10$1Gs7jtaGKJjX/7A1GqE2E.0r94/FnKphjp8dyhOVB0jZXirrkfNZW&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plain text version of that one is... wait for it... &quot;wattpad&quot;! These are easy to verify yourself by using an online tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcrypt-generator.com/&quot;&gt;bcrypt-generator.com&lt;/a&gt; that checks a given password against a given hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Wattpad recommends changing passwords - because they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be cracked even when using a good password hashing algorithm. They can't be &lt;em&gt;unencrypted&lt;/em&gt; because they weren't encrypted in the first place. If they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; encrypted and there was genuine concern they may be unencrypted then that would imply a key compromise in which case &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; passwords would be immediately decrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's your human-readable version of what password hashing is. I'll leave you again with the quote from above I'd far prefer to see in disclosure notices and ideally, a link through to this blog post too so people have accurate information they can make informed decisions on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A password hash is a representation of your password that can't be reversed, but the original password &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; still be determined if someone hashes it again and gets the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>We Didn't Encrypt Your Password, We Hashed It. Here's What That Means:</og:title>
<og:description>You've possibly just found out you're in a data breach. The organisation involved may have contacted you and advised your password was exposed but fortunately, they encrypted it. But you should change it anyway. Huh? Isn't the whole point of encryption that it protects data when exposed to unintended parties?</og:description>

<title>Bullfrog After Populous</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/bullfrog-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4363&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4363&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bullfrog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;323&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bullfrog.jpg 323w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bullfrog-158x300.jpg 158w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you an analogy of what Populous is in my mind. Imagine if I had a blank canvas. Some people that are true artists will take a palette of paint and mix them together and carefully handcraft each and every single brushstroke until they have some beautiful and amazing picture. And then there’s me. I had the blank canvas, accidentally knocked a can of paint over, and it went splat. And an art dealer has seen it and said, “That’s brilliant.” Well, I know all I’ve done is kick a can of paint. And that’s what I believe really happened with Populous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Peter Molyneux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/06/peter-molyneuxs-kingdom-in-a-box&quot;&gt;we last met Peter Molyneux and his little database-developer-turned-games-studio Bullfrog Software&lt;/a&gt;, they had just made &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; and watched in disbelief as it blew up huge. The radically innovative game joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/06/simcity-part-1-will-wrights-city-in-a-box&quot;&gt;Will Wright’s &lt;em&gt;SimCity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as one of the progenitors of a hazily delineated new genre which the media labelled the “god game” for the way it gave you direct control over an environment but only indirect control over the people therein. As &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; became a hit on three continents and sold in the hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of copies, Bullfrog struggled to reckon with the cognitive dissonances of their changed circumstances. In a matter of months, they went from a handful of poverty-stricken dreamers pissing in the sink of their miserable, toilet-less hovel of an office to Britain’s single most successful and respected games studio of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trappings of their success tended to trail behind their sales figures: when a group of Japanese executives stopped by the Bullfrog hole-in-the-wall to discuss plans for publishing &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; in their country, the senile pensioner who lived below met them at the bottom of the stairs with a mop and proceeded to beat them off the premises. “We had to get out of there as soon as possible,” says Molyneux. They wound up in a more conventional business park, whose more conventional tenants complained endlessly about their penchant for racing skateboards through the hallways and shooting BB guns out the windows. (“We were brats,” admits Molyneux today. “Horrible, horrible brats.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While certainly preferable to failure, success could be its own kind of mixed blessing. Expectations of Bullfrog, which had previously been nonexistent, were suddenly sky high. After a quickie add-on disk that brought additional levels and environments to &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, they made a rather shockingly unambitious little platformer called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/flood&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a project of Bullfrog programmer Sean Cooper. Released only in Europe for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST by Bullfrog’s publisher Electronic Arts, it garnered a collective shrug from the magazines; the market was already flooded with platformers much like this one, often with more compelling level designs. This sort of derivative work wasn’t at all what people had come to expect from Bullfrog after &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, they had something else in the works. Released in late 1990, some eighteen months after &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, the real-time war game &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; evinced a lot of innovation on its own terms even as it clearly drew from the same set of techniques and approaches that had yielded Bullfrog’s first hit. Instead of casting you as a god able to alter the very landscape of the world on behalf of your mortal followers, &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; cast you as an ordinary human on a mission to conquer the world — all 195 regional cross-sections of it, one region at a time. The ethos of indirect control that had made &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; so unique remained: you had to convince the people to rally to your cause, and had to work constantly to keep them loyal to you. Ditto a focus on large-scale environmental effects: you had to worry about the ecology of the land in order to feed, water, house, and equip your people. (After all, it’s hard to build much of anything if you’ve already clear-cut all of the forests…) While &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt;‘s Johnny L. Wilson, who was always eager to read meaning into games, may have been overstating the case when he called &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; “a dynamic treatise on the human capacity for aggrandizement and the potential consequences therein,” the same magazine’s description of it as the “thinking person’s &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;” was a good deal more tenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it suffered from many of the same flaws as its predecessor — flaws which would become consistent hallmarks of Molyneux’s work in general. He obviously wanted to give players a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of game by providing 195 levels, but, being all procedurally generated, they didn’t really build upon one another or force the player to reevaluate the tools at her disposal in interesting new ways. &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; was great fun at first — thus all the glowing reviews in the magazines — but it started to feel a little bit rote a little bit too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4364&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/powermonger/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4364&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4364&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4364&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/powermonger.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/powermonger.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/powermonger-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4364&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The graphics in &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; got a dramatic upgrade over those in &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, yielding not only aesthetic but also practical benefits: it was now possible to rotate your view of the landscape and zoom it in and out as needed, while the variety of landscape features was dramatically greater. “In &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;,” noted Molyneux, “we had hills, houses, and rivers. Thanks to this new system, we’re able to generate waterfalls, cliffs, valleys, mountains, proper towns, road networks, forests… it’s a real world!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molyneux originally conceived of &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; not so much as a standalone game as an engine for running a variety of them. After the first game with its vaguely Medieval theme, he talked of making a World War I version, a high-fantasy version, an Asian version for the Japanese market, and a version focusing on the American Civil War for the punters in the United States. But &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt;, while moderately successful, never became the sensation that &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; was, and most of those plans were abandoned; only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/powermonger-world-war-i-edition&quot;&gt;World War I data disk&lt;/a&gt; ever appeared. &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; “appeals to a lot of people who like very, very high strategic games, but it needed that extra element that would appeal to everybody and it didn’t have that,” said Molyneux after the dust had settled. He blamed the lack largely on the pressure Bullfrog was under from Electronic Arts to complete and release the game in time for Christmas, which meant that it didn’t get &lt;em&gt;played&lt;/em&gt; prior to release to anywhere near the extent of &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still searching for that elusive second million-selling hit, Bullfrog opted to drink even deeper from the old &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; well next time around. Their game for the Christmas of 1991 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/populous-ii-trials-of-the-olympian-gods&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which mated the improved interface and graphics of &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt; to the literal god-game theme of &lt;em&gt;Populous I&lt;/em&gt;. There was slightly more semblance of a plot this time out: you played a minor deity who must fight her way through a pantheon of some 35 Greek gods, culminating in Zeus himself. Your powers too were more varied than last time out; no longer could people scoff that the game was nothing more than an elaborate topography simulator, not with your ability to spawn tidal waves, whirlwinds, and lightning strikes. Yet one only had to glance at the screen, or read about its more than 1000 (!) anonymous, procedurally-generated levels to know that this was still very much &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, for both good and bad. It sold well to the committed faithful and spawned the by-now standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/populous-ii-the-challenge-games&quot;&gt;expansion pack&lt;/a&gt;; in a sop to the Japanese market, where the first &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; had become so popular as to spawn graphic novels and symphony concerts recreating the game’s soundtrack, the expansion was set in ancient Japan rather than Greece. But even so, &lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt; made relatively few new converts to the cause at home or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4365&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/populous2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4365&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4365&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4365&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/populous2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/populous2.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/populous2-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4365&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt;. Molyneux admits to feeling “ashamed” at the time to be doing a sequel at all, but he felt obligated to deliver a direct follow-up to such a massive hit. He considers &lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt; a reasonable but somewhat unimaginative sequel, which in rather typical industry fashion added a lot more &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; to the template of its predecessor in the form of new godly powers, but failed to drill down on what actually made the original fun. A fair assessment, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although their latest games hadn’t sold quite as well as the original world-beating &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, Bullfrog remained the preeminent British games studio in the minds of many. Their status was rivaled only by that of DMA Design, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/games-on-the-mersey-part-5-the-lemmings-effect&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemmings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had become upon its release in early 1991 the most successful single British game since &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;. But DMA was located way off in Dundee, Scotland, a country away from the press on Fleet Street, and when an intrepid journalist did make the trek out to those hinterlands its founder David Jones didn’t provide as many choice quotes as the gregarious Peter Molyneux, then as now one of his industry’s greatest raconteurs. The press loved him not least because he was so willing to go against the official industry position on many subjects, full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes. Asked about the effects of piracy — a subject guaranteed to produce predictions of an imminent gaming apocalypse from any other prominent industry figure — Molyneux shocked his interviewer by replying mildly that “to be honest, I don’t think that piracy hurts.” Likewise, he never hesitated to air his real feelings about competing products: “If you’ve got a crappy shoot’em-up style game, then that’s going to be pirated to hell — and it should be because it’s not even worth using this planet’s resources to produce the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain-smoking, perpetually hyperactive Molyneux got on particularly splendidly with the laddish British Amiga magazines of the time. He was up for pretty much anything when they came calling — as when he agreed to be interviewed about a recent trip to Japan while sitting on the toilet. From here he regaled his interlocutors with anecdotes about geisha girls, and told them that “Peter Molyneux” meant “wooden tit” in Japanese: “If I wanted to break the ice anywhere I just said ‘Molyneux’ and the whole room would break up.” He cultivated the persona in such interviews of a slightly befuddled ordinary bloke who liked to spend his time down at the pub when he wasn’t making games, who had no idea how he had stumbled into this charmed career of his. Substitute playing games for making them, and remove the charmed career, and he seemed of a piece with most of the people reading the interviews. He never missed an opportunity to run down his programming skills. “When we wrote &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;,” he said, “we barely knew how to put a sprite onto the screen.” In the end, he claimed, “programming isn’t really that skillful. Anybody can learn to program, anybody, within a week.” Asked to describe Bullfrog in a single sentence, he did so in three words: “Disorganized but keen.” Or, as he put it on another occasion: “We write computer games. We’re not businessmen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4366&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/molyneux-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4366&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4366&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-4366&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/molyneux.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; height=&quot;164&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4366&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The Peter Molyneux toilet interview for &lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt; magazine in December of 1991. Molyneux had by then perfected the art of press relations, which in the case of the gaming magazines often came down to the simple expedient of taking the youthful journalists down to the pub and getting them blind drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with this everyman persona, Molyneux evinced no interest whatsoever in professional credentials. Recruitment at Bullfrog operated on the principle of “show us what you got,” via little classified advertisements placed in the nether reaches of the same magazines that were featuring Molyneux and his games on their covers. Bullfrog endeared themselves even more by running tutorials in said magazines, teaching graphics and programming tricks; at least one series of tutorials concluded with a contest for those who had been following along diligently, the prize a potential job with Bullfrog. “You too can make games!” was the message. And people loved Molyneux for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was also another side to Molyneux: the side that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a real businessman, whatever his claims to the contrary — a businessman who was watching his industry with eagle eyes. When someone deigned to ask him a serious question, he could deliver a cogent, sometimes even prescient response. For example, when asked whether personal computers would ultimately win out over consoles as game-playing devices, he had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely not. PCs are too much bother, even with CDs. You’ve got to configure one of the 30 trillion sound cards’ 30 trillion settings. I don’t understand all these DMAs and IRQs and all that crap. I just fiddle around until I get it right. Until they sort that out, the machine is just going to terrify people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the general state of games in the early 1990s, he had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current trend in games like simulations, adventures, and some sports sims is that they are getting progressively harder, cleverer, and more challenging. But that doesn’t necessarily make them better games. The trouble is that a lot of games are getting so hard that only the very best gamers can play them. The first rule of game design is that you mustn’t produce games that are too complex for people to play. Being overly complex for the sake of being complex is not a good idea. Complexity is good as long as it doesn’t get in the way of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re into a new thing called interactive drama. Everybody’s doing interactive drama with interactive plots and interactive characters. But I think it’s going to be a tough, tough thing to do. Hollywood spends millions of pounds on scripts. They have hundreds and hundreds of scriptwriters and they get it right once or twice a year. And little game designers like us are coming along and we’re going to write this script which is going to have infinite variations, is going to be as entertaining as any Hollywood film, is going to have cinematic sequences in it, and we’re going to sell it for four times more than you can buy a video for. There’s something wrong there. Either we’re very, very clever chaps and Hollywood has been doing it wrong for the last 100 years, or perhaps we’re talking out of our arses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quotes like these made Molyneux into something of a spokesman for the British games industry, in the mainstream as well as the specialty press. Whatever the intrinsic merits of claims like those above, they had the advantage of poking holes in exactly the sorts of games which British studios tended to lack the resources to do as well as the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, British games still largely meant Amiga games. Thus it was tough for Molyneux, both in his role as spokesman for his industry and as a proud Briton, to admit that Bullfrog just couldn’t continue to develop their games on the Amiga first and remain competitive in the international market; the latest MS-DOS machines were pulling too rapidly ahead of Commodore’s trusty old platform. Bullfrog’s next big project after &lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt; would be developed first on MS-DOS and then ported to the Amiga in slightly downgraded form — the opposite of the studio’s earlier approach. For, as Molyneux put it, “you can let your imagination run wild” on an MS-DOS machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same project would be a welcome, much-needed departure in both form and content from the games Bullfrog had spent the last few years making. It would be a much grittier, more down-to-earth affair of rival corporations doing battle with one another in an oligarchic worldwide dystopia of the near future. As such, it was of a piece with many of the print fictions which young men like the Bullfrog crew were reading in the early 1990s — think Neal Stephenson’s &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt; and, reaching just a little further back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/11/the-prophet-of-cyberspace&quot;&gt;William Gibson’s &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the original popularizer of cyberpunk cool. (Self-effacing as ever, Molyneux claimed that “I read the first three chapters of &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, but it all went a bit above my head.”) Still, Bullfrog did add their own sprinkling of dark British humor to the mountain of cyberpunk clichés. For many months, they called the game simply &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;, after the infamously ruthless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/08/a-tale-of-the-mirror-world-part-8-life-after-tetris&quot;&gt;British media mogul Robert Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;, whose suspicious death aboard his luxury yacht and the subsequent revelation of financial malfeasance throughout his empire dominated tabloid headlines during the period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt; became known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/syndicate&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bullfrog spent a full two years working on it, marking the longest gap between games in their entire history as a studio. They claimed the end result to contain as much code and graphics as every one of their previous games combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; and its descendants were played entirely from a single interface, &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; was a more disparate affair. As the owner of a tiny upstart corporation bent, naturally enough, on taking over the world, you had to allocate research funds for equipment and cybernetic enhancements for your army of operatives, whilst choosing missions to send them on from a &lt;em&gt;Risk&lt;/em&gt;-like strategic map. But it was in the missions themselves, which played out in real time from an isometric perspective, that you spent the vast majority of your time. Here you had more direct control over your operatives than you did in &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, but they still had minds of their own, which could cause them to react with a spontaneous burst of gunfire if, for example, an enemy agent popped up in their path; it might also cause them to refuse to obey an obviously dangerous command. The missions took place in living city streets replete with civilians as well as combatants, presenting ample opportunities for mayhem. &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; has been called a proto-&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, what with the way it tempts its player to indulge in random violence and acts of destruction for their own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4373&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when it finally appeared in late 1993, just weeks before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom&quot;&gt;id Software’s landmark &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; struck many as the natural British companion to that American game, another avatar of a movement toward ever more visceral forms of violence in games. As in &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt;, blood splashed everywhere in &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; with gleeful abandon, and much of the appeal of acquiring new weapons was in the visible carnage they created. This prompted a brief-lived round of nervous stock-taking in the magazines of both countries — until the same magazines, seeing that hordes of players loved the violence, learned to defer to the readers who buttered their bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme though it was by contemporary standards, the violence in the finished &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; was reportedly toned down from earlier versions, where you had been allowed to kill babies and pets. Play testers “told us we were going too far,” mused Molyneux. “Funnily enough, they objected most to killing the puppies…” Yet he remained unapologetic on the whole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made Syndicate high in gore to be more realistic. I know this sounds like a cop-out, but it’s the player who’s violent, not us. All we’ve done is give a loaded weapon to the player and it’s up to them how to use it. I’ve always hated games that gloss over violence. Surely showing the realism of a violent act is better than discussing it? It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; had done anything new with violence, it’s just that it shows it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the changes it evinced over what had come before, &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; was a typical Bullfrog game in other ways. It started out thoroughly entrancing, but went on way too long, with only a handful of fixed mission types on offer as you slowly — &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowly — took over the world. By the mid-game, you had discovered most of the cool gear and cybernetic enhancements, and what had started out fresh and exciting had begun to turn into a bit of a grind. Thus &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; became another Molyneux game that far more players started than finished. Nevertheless, its initial appeal was enough to make it Bullfrog’s biggest hit since the original &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, and the game and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/syndicate-american-revolt&quot;&gt;its 1994 expansion pack&lt;/a&gt; are still fondly remembered by many today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, Bullfrog had grown from just a few employees to about forty, enough to have multiple projects on the boil at one time, all receiving varying degrees of attention from the hardworking and endlessly enthusiastic Peter Molyneux. Thus the next game arrived barely six months after &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;. It would prove to be one of Molyneux’s most influential creations of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project had its genesis in the first game he ever made, a text-only business simulation called &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt;, of which he had sold exactly two copies — one of them quite possibly to his mother — in 1983. That failure had continued to rankle even amidst all the success he enjoyed in later years, as did the urge to make another, less dry business simulation that would appeal to more people. “Then one day the perfect idea hit me,” Molyneux says. “I’d create a game where you control a theme park.” Molyneux:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love theme parks, and it was a great excuse to do some really good research. It’s also something where you often go back and think, “If I’d been given the chance to design this place I wouldn’t have put this here, or that there, etc.” And it’s also something that people can immediately associate themselves with. If I tell you that this game enables you to design theme parks, then you immediately know what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was indeed a brilliant stroke, one with natural appeal well beyond the typical gamer demographic who enjoyed the likes of &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;. Visually at least, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/theme-park&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would be the polar opposite of that game, cheerful and bright where it had been gritty and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4369&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/theme_park1/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4369&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4369&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4369&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park1.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park1-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4369&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released in mid-1994, &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; became a monster hit — bigger than &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;, even bigger than &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; after it was ported to every viable or semi-viable game-playing gadget in the world. Its bright and bouncy visual aesthetic presaged the Casual Revolution in games that was still some years away, while its impact on the themes and mechanics of games to come would prove even more pronounced. In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/rollercoaster-tycoon&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rollercoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a direct heir to &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; which was released by MicroProse in 1999, sold even better than Bullfrog’s take on the concept — in fact, became one of the best-selling computer games in history. Today amusement parks and roller coasters remain a staple of gaming, from the more elaborate examples of the breed available at online stores like Steam to more easygoing affairs that you can play right in your browser. Almost all of them owe not just a thematic (hah!) debt to &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; but a direct mechanical and visual one as well, from the thought bubbles that appear over the heads of the guests wandering through the park to their whimsically cartoony graphical style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It thus pains even more than usual to note how horribly &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; itself has aged, even in comparison to most of the other early Bullfrog games. Few games evidence as profound a mismatch between their surface aesthetics and their underlying gameplay as this one does. The cutesy nature of the former can confuse you for a long time, disguising the fact that the latter really doesn’t represent as great a departure from the worldview of &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt; as it seems to let on. At bottom, &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; is a nasty, cynical little game, amoral if not actively immoral — a game where your concern isn’t with the happiness of your guests at all, but strictly with the amount of money you can extract from them; a profitable theme park with miserable patrons is not only possible but the only practical road to success. This is the kind of game where you over-salt the patrons’ fries to get them to buy more soda, which cups you stuff to the brim with ice to… well, you get the picture. If you come to this game wanting to build a beautiful amusement park and show everybody who visits it a great time, as the Molyneux quote above would imply you can, you’ll wind up bankrupt and disillusioned in extremely short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard to know what parts of Theme Park to attribute to intentional subversiveness and what parts to simple tone-deafness. The intro video is a perfect case in point. Was Bullfrog aware of just how weird and creepy this thing is? The dog has the right idea: “Hell, no, leave me at home!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re willing to play the game on its own cynical terms, it has all sorts of other problems. There’s a paucity of useful feedback on both a global and granular level, which often puts you in the supremely frustrating position of failing for reasons you can’t determine. The interface in general is inscrutable in too many places, the level of micromanagement required is exhausting, and, because this is a Peter Molyneux game, winning is a task so herculean that virtually no one has ever done so: after building your first successful park in Britain, you’re expected to choose another location elsewhere in the world and do so again, ad nauseum. None of these later parks are different in any fundamental way from the first — you have the exact same rides and shops and food stands at your disposal throughout — and so the whole exercise becomes absurdly repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; was a hugely innovative and massively influential game, but it just wasn’t a very good one, even in its heyday. Its appeal was always rooted more in what it purported to be than what it actually managed to be. Because everybody loves a theme park, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4370&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/theme_park2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4370&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4370&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4370&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park2.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theme_park2-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4370&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A ride goes haywire and a kid goes flying. I’m pretty sure this part &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; deliberately subversive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullfrog’s second game of 1994 — also the last one which we’ll be visiting as part of this little survey today — might have appeared at the time to be an attempt to jump onto the 3D-action bandwagon unleashed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt;. In reality, though, Bullfrog had been experimenting with first-person 3D in-house for years. Those experiments finally led, after many detours and false starts, to &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt;, whose namesake you got to fly — because, as Molyneux wryly put it, every other possible form of flight had already been exhaustively simulated by that point. As one of several wizards, your goal was to build up your arsenal of spells and mana in order to conquer all of the opposing wizards and take over the world. And then — remember, this was a Bullfrog game — you were expected to do the same thing in fifty or so more worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Bullfrog game not to be ported at all to lower-powered platforms like the Amiga, &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt; was a stunning technical achievement in its time. While other 3D action games segmented themselves into discrete levels made up of interior spaces only, it gave you a complete open-ended world to explore. It was a forthrightly artsy game, something &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt; and the rash of similar games which followed it certainly never aspired to be. In that spirit, it contained no words during actual gameplay, nothing to distract from the evocative wonder of its world. Bullfrog’s staffers talked in interviews about the joy they got just from drifting around above its landscapes before they’d put any enemies in — playing as they did so, they said only half facetiously, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4w4aKsWzkI&quot;&gt;Enya albums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt; even had a special stereoscopic 3D mode, for those able to buy or make 3D glasses to suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4372&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/magic_carpet-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4372&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4372&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4372&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/magic_carpet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/magic_carpet.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/magic_carpet-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4372&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The graphics in &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt; remain strikingly beautiful to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you got four or five levels into it, however, it revealed itself to suffer from the standard set of Bullfrog problems. Each of its worlds was superficially different from the one before, but not in a way that really challenged you or introduced a sense of progression beyond the increasing level number on your status screen. The game shot its bolt at the beginning, then just kept giving you more of the same. Peter Molyneux spoke often in interviews about his desire to give gamers lots of value for their money by making &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; games. Yet, like songwriters with a knack for melody who have no clue how to take it to the bridge, he and his mates consistently struggled to find ways of varying their formulas so that their games weren’t just more of the same for hours on end. As it was, what you saw in the first hour of a Bullfrog game was what you would continue to see for the next hundred hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for once, this Bullfrog game’s presentation and theme alone weren’t enough to save it on store shelves. Its abstracted and almost aggressively artsy personality combined with its high production costs and high system requirements to make it Bullfrog’s first outright money loser since &lt;em&gt;Flood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How, then, should we sum up these five busy years in the life of Peter Molyneux and his first company? We can feel certain that anything we do say must apply almost equally to his career since 1994; whether you love or hate his work, its strengths and weaknesses haven’t changed very much over the decades. An unkind assessment — of which there have been many in the last ten years in particular, as Molyneux’s real or perceived penchant for over-hyping and under-delivering has come home to roost — might peg him as a bit of a dilettante, an ideas man unwilling to do the hard work to turn his ideas into balanced games that remain playable and interesting over the long term. But the reality is, as usual, more complex than any single pejorative — or compliment, for that matter — can encompass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some keys to the puzzle of Peter Molyneux can undoubtedly be found in the scene from which he sprang. His design aesthetic, like that of so many British game developers, was to a large extent forged by the limited resources — in terms of both target hardware and finances — which they had at their disposal. Bullfrog’s stubborn reliance on procedurally-generated rather than handcrafted levels, often to their games’ detriment, can be traced back at least to Ian Bell and David Braben’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the vast eight-galaxy universe it packed into a 32 K BBC Micro via the magic of the Fibonacci sequence. When one didn’t have much space to store handcrafted levels and didn’t have many people to hand to make them, procedural generation seemed the only practical way forward. But Bullfrog stuck with it to the exclusion of other approaches for too long — long after other approaches became viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pieces of the puzzle are more idiosyncratic to Molyneux himself, a fellow whose own personality was always all but inseparable from that of his company. Already by the mid-1990s, his tendency to stretch himself in too many directions at once was starting to become an issue. During the period of &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt;, Bullfrog also worked on something called &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;, where you would breed predatory fish in an underwater base to attack your rivals on the ocean floor. Molyneux even mooted linking &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt;: “If you’re playing &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt;, you will be able to jump off the carpet and into the ocean. The computer will then sense whether you have &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; on your hard disk and plunge you straight into that, based totally on the world you were just flying around [in].” Another work in progress, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success&quot;&gt;highly inadvisable&lt;/a&gt; title of &lt;em&gt;MIST (My Incredible Superhero Team)&lt;/em&gt;, would let you build and control your own superhero: “If you want to make him strong and give him rubber wings and death vision, then you can do that. But of course, they’ve all got their Achilles heel.” And then there was &lt;em&gt;Biosphere&lt;/em&gt;, featuring a more elaborate, planet-wide take on genetic engineering along with a fictional context shamelessly ripped off from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2013/11/douglas-adams&quot;&gt;Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt;, where you would “run a team of genetic and planet engineers who modify planets for shiploads of colonists. Unfortunately for you, the colonists are generally hairdressers and telephone engineers, so when they get there they’re pretty useless — and they’ll probably be eaten by dinosaurs. So you have to protect them.” None of these games were ever completed, despite a substantial amount of time and resources being devoted to each of them. Indeed, as the resources available to him increased, Molyneux’s proclivity for rushing enthusiastically down such blind alleys increased in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molyneux’s passionate prioritization of experimentation over the nuts and bolts of game design made him a less complete designer than, say, a Sid Meier. And yet he, along with other designers of a similar bent, have been scarcely less necessary for the evolution of their medium. Few if any designers have dared to put more &lt;em&gt;new stuff&lt;/em&gt; out there than Molyneux, even if often in imperfect form. Such experiments can become the building blocks for more grounded designers to build upon, as the example of the badly flawed &lt;em&gt;Theme&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Park&lt;/em&gt; begetting the absolutely brilliant &lt;em&gt;Rollercoaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; proves in spades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another component of Molyneux’s claim to the status of gaming visionary is more generalized: his complete conviction during the early 1990s that, as he put it, “multiplayer games are the future of gaming.” With the exception only of &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt;, every Molyneux game from &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; on not only supported multiplayer sessions between players on separate computers&lt;sup id=&quot;rf1-4362&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/bullfrog-after-populous/#fn1-4362&quot; title=&quot;Multiplayer &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Syndicate&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; was made available to the public only in the expansion pack.&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but was literally designed for it first and foremost. That is to say that a serial or network link-up went into &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Populous II&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Syndicate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Magic Carpet&lt;/em&gt; long before anyone even began to think about adding a computer opponent. One might even call this fact the perfect riposte to all of my complaints about these Bullfrog games. If you played them alone, you were, in Molyneux’s mind anyway, playing them &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in some fundamental sense. Complaints about the sameness of a game from level to level no longer carry much weight when you’re playing against that ultimate agent of unpredictability, a fellow human. While the nature of the times dictated that most people played them solo, there are nevertheless all sorts of anecdotes about the sharing of those early Bullfrog games among friends; my favorite might be the teenage next-door neighbors who made a 25-meter cable to run between their bedroom windows so that they could play &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; together every night to their hearts’ content. Stories like these, soon to be joined by tales of multiplayer &lt;em&gt;DOOM&lt;/em&gt;, were clear signposts in their day to where much of gaming was heading, just as soon as the world’s telecommunications infrastructure caught up to the designers’ vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux have ironically suffered the opposite fate from that of the standard clichés about pioneers. Greatly appreciated in their own time for all of the bold new things they attempted to do and be, their games’ practical deficiencies seem all too obvious to our more jaded eyes of today. But, even if we can’t quite praise any one them as a standalone masterpiece, we can recognize the purpose they served in opening up so much virgin territory for exploration by later, often better games. And if Molyneux himself has sinned by promising too much too often, it should be recognized as well that his transgressions have never had their roots in greed or guile. He just wants to make really, really amazing games — wants to make lots of them, thereby to make lots and lots of people happy. There are worse character flaws to have.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SoftBank unmasked as ‘Nasdaq whale’ that stoked tech rally</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;SoftBank is the “Nasdaq whale” that has bought billions of dollars’ worth of US equity derivatives in a series of trades that stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks before a sharp pullback on Thursday and Friday, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese conglomerate had been snapping up options in tech stocks during the past month in huge amounts, fuelling the largest ever trading volumes in contracts linked to individual companies, these people said. One banker described it as a “dangerous” bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggressive move into the options market marks a new chapter for the investment powerhouse, which in recent years has made huge bets on privately held technology start-ups through its $100bn Vision Fund. After the coronavirus market tumult hit those bets, the company established an asset management unit for public investments using capital contributed by its founder, Masayoshi Son. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments, which has shocked market veterans. “These are some of the biggest trades I’ve seen in 20 years of doing this,” said one derivatives-focused US hedge fund manager. “The flow is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in purchases of call options — derivatives that give the user the right to buy a stock at a pre-agreed price — has been the talk of Wall Street, as the sheer size of the trades appears to have exacerbated a “melt-up” in many big technology stocks over the past few months. In August alone, Tesla’s share price shot up 74 per cent, while Apple gained 21 per cent, Google’s parent Alphabet rose 10 per cent and Amazon 9 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person familiar with SoftBank’s trades said it was “gobbling up” options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous. “People are caught with their pants down, massively short. This can continue. The whale is still hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftBank declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n-content-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2Fbb4db9c0-eea1-11ea-a3eb-6bc7dd6676b0-standard.png?dpr=1&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;source=next&amp;amp;width=700&quot; data-id=&quot;https://api.ft.com/content/ec3e0924-7fc9-4cf6-94ea-6ef8f086ef34&quot; data-image-type=&quot;graphic&quot; data-original-image-width=&quot;700&quot; data-original-image-height=&quot;511&quot; alt=&quot;Chart showing notional volume ($bn) traded in listed US equity options (10-day rolling average), indicating that single stock call option volume has been rising rapidly&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq was at one point on Friday down 10 per cent from its peak — the common definition of a correction — yet the options boom means that the US stock market remains vulnerable to further bursts of volatility, according to Charlie McElligott, a strategist at Nomura. “The street is still very much in a dangerous space, and that flow is still out there,” he wrote in a note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall nominal value of calls traded on individual US stocks has averaged $335bn a day over the past two weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That is more than triple the rolling average between 2017 and 2019. The retail trading boom has played a big part in the frenzy, but investors say the size of many recent option purchases are far too big to be retail-driven. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusually, single-stock call trading volumes have surged beyond the average daily volumes of calls on the broader US stock market, and are almost as high as the level of trading in index puts — which give the buyer the right to sell at a preset price and act as a popular form of insurance against stocks falling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-teaser__image-container js-teaser-image-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o-teaser__image-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;o-teaser__image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9b14b629-2244-430c-893f-57e5383d3db0.jpg?source=next&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;width=240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size and aggressiveness of the mysterious call buyer, coupled with the summer trading lull, has been a big factor in the buoyant performance of many big tech names as well as the broader US stock market, according to Mr McElligott. This week, he warned that dynamics around options meant the heavy purchases forced banks on the other side of the trades to hedge themselves by buying stocks, in a “classic ‘tail wags the dog’ feedback loop”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains the US stock market climbing in tandem with the Vix index — often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — and meant that equities were fragile and vulnerable to the kind of sudden setback that erupted on Thursday. “The equity volatility complex is acting ‘broken’ and indicative that ‘something’s gotta give’,” Mr McElligott warned in a note shortly before the Nasdaq fell 5 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One banker familiar with the latest options trading activity said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/acbd4efd-e8ef-4d16-bf0c-83fc4df83601&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Thursday’s market pullback&lt;/a&gt; would have been painful for SoftBank, but he expected the buying to resume. A larger and longer-lasting stock market decline would be more damaging for this strategy, and would probably involve rapid declines, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options buying comes alongside $10bn in public investments SoftBank is targeting through its new asset management arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sec.report/Document/0001062993-20-004032/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt; to the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, SoftBank has bought stakes of almost $2bn in Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla — investments that are partially funded by cash from its $41bn asset sale programme that was triggered by a collapse in its share price during the Covid-19 market turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to correct Tesla’s share price rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
