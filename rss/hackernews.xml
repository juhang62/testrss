<description>&lt;p class=&quot;feature-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-website-mode.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Posted October 13, 2019 in &lt;a class=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;https://micahflee.com/tags/onionshare&quot;&gt;onionshare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;tag&quot; href=&quot;https://micahflee.com/tags/code&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce that OnionShare 2.2 is released! You can download it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://onionshare.org/&quot;&gt;onionshare.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote OnionShare in 2014, it let you anonymously and securely send files to people. It worked like this: OnionShare zips up the files, starts a local web server on your computer with a link to this zip file, makes this website accessible as a Tor onion service, and shows you the URL of the web server. You send someone this .onion URL, they load it in Tor Browser (loading the website hosted directly on your computer), and then they can download the zip file. As soon as the download is complete, OnionShare shuts down the web service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since then it has gotten a whole lot better (largely thanks to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki/Developing-OnionShare&quot;&gt;growing community&lt;/a&gt; of volunteer contributors). Instead of just sending files, you can use it to receive files now, allowing you to turn your computer into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/02/onionshare-2/&quot;&gt;anonymous dropbox&lt;/a&gt;. But it has always worked the same way: hosting an anonymous website locally on your computer. But since OnionShare hosts a website on your computer anyway, why not use it to &lt;em&gt;host actual websites&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-website-mode.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the “Share Files” and “Receive Files” tabs, OnionShare 2.2 introduces the “Publish Website” tab. You drag all of the files that make up your website into the OnionShare window and click “Start sharing.” It will start a web server to host your static website and give you a .onion URL. This website is only accessible from the Tor network, so people will need Tor Browser to visit it. People who visit your website will have no idea who you are – they won’t have access to your IP address, and they won’t know your identity or your location. And, so long as your website visitors are able to access the Tor network, the website can’t be censored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to keep in mind about how website publishing in OnionShare works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any folder in the website that you’re sharing includes an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, then when someone loads that folder in Tor Browser it will load that html file. If any folder doesn’t include an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, it will show a directory listing instead. So you could, for example, publish a website that’s just a bunch of files without any html, and people who load it in Tor Browser will able to browse your files and folders and download individual files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-directory-listing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sharing something that’s not public, OnionShare now uses HTTP basic authentication. So the URLs that you share look like &lt;code&gt;http://onionshare:[password]@[address].onion&lt;/code&gt; now. When someone loads the URL in Tor Browser, it will ask them if they want to login first, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-basic-auth.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they click OK, the URL in the address bar no longer contains the &lt;code&gt;onionshare:[password]&lt;/code&gt; part, and just looks like a normal website. (This protects against shoulder surfing, where an attacker looks at someone’s screen to see the OnionShare URL and visit it themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-basic-auth-loaded.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to publish your website for anyone to see, you can always go to settings and enable “public mode”, which simply doesn’t use a username and password anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use OnionShare to publish a website that you intend to remain online for a long time, it’s important to remember that your computer itself is literally the web server. If you turn off your computer, or even just suspend your laptop, the website will go down. To prevent this, you’ll have to use a computer that’s always turned on for this. You’ll also probably want to go into settings and check “Use a persistent address” – this means that if you close OnionShare and re-open it again (for example, if you have to install updates on the computer and reboot it), the URL will stay the same the next time you start the server. If you don’t use a persistent address, every URL is temporary, and there’s no way to re-use an old URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that’s new is that OnionShare will now show you exactly what web requests people are making to your website (you get to see this when sharing and receiving files too, not just for publishing websites). For example, here’s a website hosted by OnionShare getting scanned with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cirt.net/nikto2&quot;&gt;nikto&lt;/a&gt; web vulnerability scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-nikto.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, since we put in all of the work to make it so you can browse through directory listings when publishing a website, we also made it so you can similarly browse through folders that are being shared when just sharing files, so people can see exactly what files they’re about to download before downloading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micahflee.com/2019/10/new-version-of-onionshare-makes-it-easy-for-anyone-to-publish-anonymous-uncensorable-websites/onionshare-share-directory-listing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you go into settings and uncheck “Stop sharing after files have been sent” (this is the setting that makes the server shutdown after the first person downloads the files you’re sharing), then people will also be able to download individual files that you’re sharing, instead of only having the option to download everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the new OnionShare!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DuckDuckGo Search Improvements</title>
<link>https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-search-improvements/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-search-improvements/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While we've been busily improving our privacy protection ducklings — like DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser (for &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-search-stories/id663592361?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials (for &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;) — we haven't been neglecting our first born — &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo Private Search&lt;/a&gt;! In fact, quite the opposite — we've made several improvements recently that we're excited to share with you. They should make your searching not only more effective, but also a more pleasant experience, and still of course with our same &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/privacy&quot;&gt;strict commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt;: no personal information is associated with your searches, such that you have no search history and therefore no search profiling or ads following you around based on your searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drum roll... 🥁🥁🥁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pastyeardatefilter&quot;&gt;Past Year Date Filter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/09/past-year-filter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of past year filter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our most requested feature is now ready for use! We've had date filters for a long time, but previously the maximum time length was one month. Now you have &quot;past year&quot; as a filter option — enjoy going back further in time. &lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/delorean_small.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delorean car from Back To The Future.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;darkthemerefinements&quot;&gt;Dark Theme Refinements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/09/change-with-module.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the dark theme in DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dark theme has proven to be very popular and so we've given it some love with various refinements for a much more comfortable and coherent feel. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/settings#theme&quot;&gt;in the settings&lt;/a&gt;, where you can select it from our list of pre-made themes, or go crazy with your own visual customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;serversintheindiansubcontinent&quot;&gt;Servers in the Indian Subcontinent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard you — connecting to DuckDuckGo Search from the Indian subcontinent was slow. So, we added a lot of servers there, which provides a welcome and noticeable performance boost for users in that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on each of these improvements, we had our team leaders answer some potential FAQs below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;featurepastyeardatefilter&quot;&gt;Feature: Past Year Date Filter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;teammemberbrianstoner&quot;&gt;Team Member: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bsstoner&quot;&gt;Brian Stoner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've been looking forward to being able to search by year for a long time! Why add it now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been one of our most requested features and so we have been trying to find a way to add it for a while. It wasn't straightforward for us to do because we work with a variety of different partners to produce the anonymous search results you see on DuckDuckGo. With their help, we were finally able make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When doing time-limited searches, I sometimes can't see related news stories. How can I find those?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have a dedicated News search tab on every search that you can click into if you want to see only news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/news-tab2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the News tab on DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'd love to also be able to filter by e.g. 6 months, or between specific dates. Is that possible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not currently, but we may add it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there any other search filters that could help me find things even faster?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One that is very popular outside the US is our region filter. Unlike other search engines we don't force you into using a search experience that is specific to your local country/region. Instead you can use our region filter and search as if you were anywhere in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/region-filter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the region filter in DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a lot of great filters in our image search. If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=moon&amp;amp;iar=images&amp;amp;iaf=layout%3AWide%2Ccolor%3ABlue%2Ctype%3Aphoto%2Csize%3ALarge&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images&quot;&gt;large, wide, blue, photographs of the moon&lt;/a&gt;, we can do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/image-filters-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the image filters in DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=train+ride&amp;amp;iar=videos&amp;amp;iaf=videoDefinition%3Ahigh%2CvideoDuration%3Along%2CvideoLicense%3AcreativeCommon&amp;amp;iax=videos&amp;amp;ia=videos&quot;&gt;long, high definition, Creative Commons-licensed videos of train rides&lt;/a&gt;, we can do that too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/video-filters.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the video filters in DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;featuredarkthemerefinements&quot;&gt;Feature: Dark Theme Refinements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;teammemberbrianhall&quot;&gt;Team Member: &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.social/@brian&quot;&gt;Brian Hall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What changes to the dark theme should users look out for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most obvious thing is the beautiful new color scheme! Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thomweerd&quot;&gt;talented designer Thom&lt;/a&gt; started this process by defining a color palette that was optimized for readability. This allowed us to establish a consistent visual hierarchy where we can subtly call out important areas of the search results pages like our Instant Answers without distracting from the rest of the text on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/09/dark-theme-instant-answer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of an Instant Answer using the dark theme.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was the reasoning behind the changes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love our dark theme, and we know that many of you do as well, so we wanted to give it a refresh to match many of the improvements we've been making to our default theme. With several web browsers introducing support for detecting the OS theme preferences, we thought the timing was perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have my OS set to dark mode. Will DuckDuckGo detect that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely! If you're using the default light theme, DuckDuckGo will match your OS theme automatically! If you've selected a different theme (or have customized your theme) you can open the settings dropdown on the SERP and click the theme that matches your OS theme, and DuckDuckGo will begin matching your OS theme automatically moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/os-themes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the dark mode selector in macOS.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I want to add my own tweaks to the theme?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can tweak the theme to your heart's content at &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/settings#appearance&quot;&gt;https://duckduckgo.com/settings#appearance&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2019/10/duckduckgo-themes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the themes available in DuckDuckGo Search.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there plans for more themes or other design updates?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're always tweaking and updating DuckDuckGo to offer the best experience possible, so keep an eye out for changes and send us your feedback — we'd love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;featureserversintheindiansubcontinent&quot;&gt;Feature: Servers in the Indian Subcontinent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;teammemberpreferstostayanonymous&quot;&gt;Team Member: (prefers to stay anonymous)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What new region has been added?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new region is Mumbai, covering users mostly from India, but also many others who are now closer to this region than other points of presence of our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How will it affect me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should expect better a response time of our search engine if you're close to this region. In other words, faster search results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does this mean my personal information is now stored in Mumbai?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/privacy&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo doesn't store any personal information&lt;/a&gt;. Your searches are still anonymous, you'll just be connecting to our servers in this region if it happens to be the closest to your physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What regions do you have servers in already?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United States (Virginia, California), Europe (Ireland), Australia, Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are you planning to add servers next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We do not have active plans yet but it usually depends on many factors, so it's only a matter of time before we prioritize our next region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more privacy advice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/duckduckgo&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and stay protected and informed with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter&quot;&gt;privacy newsletters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1.png&quot; class=&quot;attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image jetpack-lazy-image&quot; alt=&quot;ionic react launch&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1.png 1600w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1-300x165.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1-768x422.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1-1024x563.png 1024w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/react-v1.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we’re thrilled to announce the general availability of Ionic React, a native React version of Ionic Framework that makes it easy to build apps for iOS, Android, Desktop, and the web as a Progressive Web App. All with one code base, standard React development patterns, and using the standard &lt;code&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; library and huge ecosystem around the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionic React represents the most significant change in Ionic Framework’s history and opens up Ionic Framework to a whole new audience. Given that, we’d like to tell a bit of the story about how we got here, why we built it, and who it’s for (jump to the end if you just want to see some code, I won’t be offended 😅).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why React?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that have been following Ionic since the early days, it might be a surprise to hear that we now support more than just Angular, and React of all things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started Ionic Framework, the mission was to empower web developers to build top-quality apps using their existing web development skills, focused on the massive ecosystem around the web platform and web technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We envisioned being able to build rich JavaScript-powered controls and distribute them as simple HTML tags any web developer could assemble into an awesome app. Turns out we were a few years too early on that being possible directly in the browser, so, instead, we jumped on the emerging category of frontend frameworks and went all-in on AngularJS and their awesome directive system. Ever since then, we’ve been known primarily as an Angular-focused app framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2019, and the frontend ecosystem looks nothing like it did back in 2013. Developers have access to tons of awesome frontend framework options, and few are as popular and successful as React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revisited our original vision and realized that building a version of Ionic Framework for React made perfect sense. Combined with the fact that we had several React fans join the Ionic team over the years (and many super-fan converts, including yours truly!), there was strong desire internally to see Ionic Framework support React as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we embarked on a quest to build a native React version of Ionic Framework that we felt React developers would love to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what about React Native?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why we’d build Ionic React when React already has a great mobile option with React Native.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked ourselves that, too. We sure didn’t want to invest a ton of time building something that would be an apples-to-apples comparison with React Native. We’d rather spend our creative energy on technology that solves problems others aren’t solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we took a step back, we realized that Ionic React brought something pretty unique to the React ecosystem, and had a very different vision for what the future of app development might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building an abstraction on top of iOS and Android native UI controls, we wanted to build something that was DOM-native, that would use the standard &lt;code&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; library and all the libraries that supported it out of the box, and the decades of existing work around the browser. When we looked at installs for &lt;code&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt; compared to &lt;code&gt;react-native&lt;/code&gt;, it was clear to us that vastly more React development was happening in the browser and on top of the DOM than on top of the native iOS or Android UI systems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://npmcharts.com/compare/react-native,react-dom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;16x more, in fact!&lt;/a&gt;). That further confirmed our belief that “web devs wanna web dev” and take advantage of their experience and existing library of functionality they’ve built on the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, developers are increasingly interested in Progressive Web Apps, especially in the enterprise. PWAs are, at best, an afterthought in the React Native ecosystem (and actually, not officially supported). In contrast, Ionic Framework is one of the leading PWA solutions and has some of the best performance for PWAs in the entire web ecosystem, thanks in part to our work on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/introducing-stencil-one-1-0-0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stencil project&lt;/a&gt; which we use to generate highly efficient components under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also heard from a number of developers that wanted to use Ionic React in their existing React Native apps, by building more screens in their app out of a native WebView frame (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://capacitor.ionicframework.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Capacitor&lt;/a&gt;, more on that in a bit) to move more quickly or enable traditional web developers to work in tandem with the existing native and React Native dev teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after talking with a lot of fellow React developers at conferences like React Rally, it was clear that there was a gap in the React ecosystem that Ionic could fill, along with a desire for an easier mobile and Progressive Web App development solution than what was currently available in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This isn’t your father’s Cordova&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your last experience with a web-focused mobile development platform was with Cordova, we understand if you didn’t have a great experience and might be hesitant to come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ionic still supports Cordova, new Ionic apps run on an all-new cross-platform engine called &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Capacitor&lt;/a&gt; that we built in-house. Capacitor takes modern JS and browser features, and makes it possible to deploy one app across iOS, Android, Electron, and the web as a Progressive Web App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Progressive Web App support was a major goal of Capacitor, and many Capacitor APIs have powerful PWA support, such as Camera which has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/pwa-elements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;custom UI experience available&lt;/a&gt; for adding native-quality camera features to your PWA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is inspired by Cordova, in practice the development experience is very different. Capacitor is available as a modern JS API you can import directly into your app, with easy-to-use APIs for everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/filesystem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;File management&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/geolocation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Geolocation&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/share/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;app-to-app sharing&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/push-notifications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Push&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/local-Notifications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Local Notifications&lt;/a&gt;. And exposing new Native SDKs to Capacitor is incredibly easy, requiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/ios/custom-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;just a bit of wrapper code&lt;/a&gt; with first-class support for Swift on iOS (Java on Android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Ionic developers that have made the switch, we hear that the experience is much preferred, and feels quite a bit different from Cordova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitor is being used today in some pretty huge apps, including some that you will likely use as a consumer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/enterprise/customers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;various global fast food establishments&lt;/a&gt;. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re confident you’ll love the combination of Ionic React and Capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More than Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic is bringing something different to the React and cross-platform ecosystem: a fully-supported, enterprise-ready offering with services, advisory, tooling, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/identity-vault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;supported native functionality&lt;/a&gt; available to teams that need more than they can get through community-supported options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic, the company behind Ionic Framework, works with hundreds of medium to large companies and enterprises, providing advanced support and software that they need as they build mission-critical apps for their business. We’ve got lots more information on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/enterprise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/appflow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Appflow&lt;/a&gt; service can be used to perform remote app updates in real-time, or build iOS and Android binaries as part of a CI/CD workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the company behind Ionic Framework, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/ionic-2019-business-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2019 Business Update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The first official version of Ionic React is v4.11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the backstory, how do you actually start building with Ionic React?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Ionic React is easy. First, if you haven’t already done so, install the latest Ionic CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;npm i -g ionic 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, create a new project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;ionic start my-react-app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI will guide you through the setup process by first asking a couple of questions. The first of which is what framework you would like to use, select React (of course!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3004 jetpack-lazy-image&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework.png 1400w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-300x72.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-768x183.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-1024x244.png 1024w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3004&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework.png 1400w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-300x72.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-768x183.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-framework-1024x244.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the CLI will ask which starter template you would like to use. We ship a few different starters to help get you up and running quickly. Go ahead and choose tabs for this demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3005 jetpack-lazy-image&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter.png 1400w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-300x102.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-768x260.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-1024x347.png 1024w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3005&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter.png 1400w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-300x102.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-768x260.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-pick-starter-1024x347.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI will now create your app and install all the dependencies. Once it is done, go into the directory and launch the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;ionic serve
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the covers, the &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; command uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Create React App&lt;/a&gt; (CRA) project to compile your app, start a dev server, and open your app in a new browser window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, you will see your starter app up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-half wp-image-3006 jetpack-lazy-image&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen.png 828w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-169x300.png 169w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-768x1365.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-576x1024.png 576w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-half wp-image-3006&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen.png 828w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-169x300.png 169w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-768x1365.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-tab1-screen-576x1024.png 576w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s take a tour of what a stock Ionic React app consists of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up the project in your favorite code editor and leave the &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; command running. Any changes we make will automatically be recompiled and refresh the app in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ionic React project is just a React project, with the setup you would normally find from a CRA app. One difference you might notice is that we use TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are big fans of TypeScript at Ionic, and we believe TypeScript in React provides a great, productive experience. However, if you want to use plain JavaScript, rename the files to use a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension and remove any of the type annotations from within the file, and your Ionic React app will now be a JavaScript app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder contains all the code for the app. The main entry point is the &lt;code&gt;App.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file. Let’s break down what’s happening in this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top, we have the typical React and React Router imports, and then a series of imports from &lt;code&gt;@ionic/react&lt;/code&gt;. Each of our Ionic components is exported as its own individual React component. In essence, Ionic React is a wrapper around the web components we have in the Ionic Core project but exported in a way that makes them feel native to a React developer. Any updates and enhancements we make to Ionic Core will automatically be available in Ionic React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we import a series of core CSS files. After those, there is also a &lt;code&gt;variables.css&lt;/code&gt; file, which you can use to customize the theme of your app. For more info on theming your app, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/themes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we have the main App component. Notice that in the starters, we are using 100% functional components. We are fans of this approach, but if you prefer class-based components, those work great as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3008 jetpack-lazy-image&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code.png 1200w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-300x295.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-768x755.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-1024x1007.png 1024w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3008&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code.png 1200w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-300x295.png 300w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-768x755.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-app-code-1024x1007.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Ionic app starts with the &lt;code&gt;IonApp&lt;/code&gt; component, which is the base container, and helps set up the screen to work great on both mobile and desktop. Next, the &lt;code&gt;IonReactRouter&lt;/code&gt; component is a wrapper around the React Router library’s &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; component. To do the native-like page transitions and to maintain the state of the pages as you browse through your app, we augment React Router with some additional functionality. Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/navigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Navigation &amp;amp; Routing&lt;/a&gt; guide for more info on how routing works in Ionic React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of our tabs starter is now in the &lt;code&gt;IonTabs&lt;/code&gt; component. The &lt;code&gt;IonRouterOutlet&lt;/code&gt; contains a series of Routes (from React Router) for each of the pages in the tab interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;IonTabBar&lt;/code&gt; component contains the bottom tab bar with a button for each of the pages, which forward to the &lt;code&gt;Tab1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tab2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Tab3&lt;/code&gt; components in the &lt;code&gt;src/pages&lt;/code&gt; folder. The &lt;code&gt;Tab1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Tab2&lt;/code&gt; pages have good examples on how to use some common Ionic components, but the &lt;code&gt;Tab3&lt;/code&gt; page is relatively bare. Let’s change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will set up our empty tab to be a page to show a list of employees, with some demo data being pulled from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uifaces.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;UIFaces&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s update the tab bar in App.tsx to show a new label and icon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;IonTabButton tab=&quot;tab3&quot; href=&quot;/tab3&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;IonIcon icon={people} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;IonLabel&amp;gt;Employees&amp;lt;/IonLabel&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/IonTabButton&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;people&lt;/code&gt; icon is imported from ‘ionicons/icons’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;code&gt;Tab3.tsx&lt;/code&gt;, and replace the contents of the file with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;import { IonAvatar, IonContent, IonHeader, IonItem, IonLabel, IonList, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar, useIonViewWillEnter } from '@ionic/react';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

interface Person {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  position: string;
  photo: string;
}

const Tab3Page: React.FC = () =&amp;gt; {

  const [people, setPeople] = useState&amp;lt;Person[]&amp;gt;([]);

  useIonViewWillEnter(async () =&amp;gt; {
    const result = await fetch('https://uifaces.co/api?limit=25', {
      headers: { 'x-API-KEY': '873771d7760b846d51d025ac5804ab' }
    });
    const data = await result.json();
    setPeople(data);
  });

  return (
    &amp;lt;IonPage&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;IonHeader&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;IonToolbar&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;IonTitle&amp;gt;Employees&amp;lt;/IonTitle&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/IonToolbar&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/IonHeader&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;IonContent&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;IonList&amp;gt;
          {people.map((person, idx) =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;EmployeeItem key={idx} person={person} /&amp;gt;)}
        &amp;lt;/IonList&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/IonContent&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/IonPage&amp;gt;
  );
};

const EmployeeItem: React.FC&amp;lt;{ person: Person }&amp;gt; = ({ person }) =&amp;gt; {
  return (
    &amp;lt;IonItem &amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;IonAvatar slot=&quot;start&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;img src={person.photo} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/IonAvatar&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;IonLabel&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{person.name}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{person.position}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/IonLabel&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/IonItem&amp;gt;
  );
}

export default Tab3Page;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we define a TypeScript interface for a Person, which will give us some type safety and code completion when using the employees a bit later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top, we import a couple of React hooks to use, the first is &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;, which allows us to use state in our functional components, and the second is &lt;code&gt;useIonViewWillEnter&lt;/code&gt;, which is a lifecycle method provided by Ionic that will fire each time the view comes into view. Find out more about Ionic lifecycle methods &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/lifecycle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a function to the &lt;code&gt;useIonViewWillEnter&lt;/code&gt; hook that will fire that will call into the UIFaces API (using the fetch API) and return a list of twenty-five people. When the fetch request finishes, we call &lt;code&gt;setPeople&lt;/code&gt; to update the people state variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the JSX, we have an ‘IonList’ component, which contains an &lt;code&gt;EmployeeItem&lt;/code&gt; for each of the people. We separate out the EmployeeItem into its own component (defined a bit farther down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the updates to Tab3, we can now get a list of employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3007 jetpack-lazy-image&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen.png 828w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen-169x300.png 169w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen-768x1365.png 768w, https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen-576x1024.png 576w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ionic-react-employee-screen.png?is-pending-load=1&quot; srcset=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

<title>Dutch family &amp;#039;waiting for end of time&amp;#039; discovered in basement</title>

<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;A drone photo of the farm, where a father and six children had been living in the cellar, in Ruinerwold, The Netherlands&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12D44/production/_109242177_057314921-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Police discovered a hidden room in the basement and said there were &quot;many unanswered questions&quot;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A family who spent nine years in a basement &quot;waiting for the end of time&quot; have been discovered by police in the Netherlands after one of them turned up at a local pub, reports say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man of 58 and a family with young adults aged 18 to 25 were living at a farm in the province of Drenthe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were found after the eldest of the children ordered beer at a bar in the nearby village of Ruinerwold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then told staff he needed help, broadcaster RTV Drenthe reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older man, who has been arrested, was initially assumed to be the father, but local mayor Roger de Groot later told reporters that was not the case. Nor was the man the owner of the farmhouse, Mr de Groot said, adding: &quot;I've never seen anything like it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public broadcaster said that the family had been living in isolation waiting for the end of time. Unconfirmed reports said the children's father was among those found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar owner Chris Westerbeek described how a man had come in, ordered five beers and drunk them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then I had a chat with him and he revealed he had run away and needed help... then we called the police,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;He had long hair, a dirty beard, wore old clothes and looked confused. He said he'd never been to school and hadn't been to the barber for nine years.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;EPA&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Neighbours believe the family lived on vegetables grown on the farm
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm. He said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers visited the remote farmhouse and carried out a search. They discovered a hidden staircase behind a cupboard in the living room that led down to a basement room where the family were housed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruinerwold is a village with a population of less than 3,000. The farm is outside the village and is accessible by a bridge over a canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farm, which is part-hidden behind a row of trees, also has a large vegetable plot and a goat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neighbour told Dutch media that he had only ever seen one man on the farm, no children, and that there had been animals on the grounds, such as geese and a dog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local postman said he had never delivered a letter there. &quot;It's actually pretty strange, now I come to think about it,&quot; he told Algemeen Dagblad news website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the area tweeted the news and one reporter posted images of the farmhouse, saying he had been asked to keep at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police in Drenthe confirmed that a 58-year-old man had been arrested and was under investigation after refusing to co-operate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yesterday someone reported to us [that they were] worried about the living conditions of people in a house in Buitenhuizerweg in #Ruinerwold,&quot; they wrote in a tweet. &quot;We went there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We still have many unanswered questions,&quot; they said, adding that all scenarios were open and their investigation was fully under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmhouse and the surrounding grounds were cordoned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear how long the family had been in the basement or what had happened to the children's mother, although the mayor said she had died some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some reports suggested the 58-year-old had suffered a stroke and had been confined to his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;You might also be interested in:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Firefox Privacy How-To Guide</title>
<link>https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-28540&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-privacy--1024x536.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox privacy&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-privacy--1024x536.png 1024w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-privacy--300x157.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-privacy--768x402.png 768w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-privacy-.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This guide contains updated recommendations and privacy tweaks for Firefox, revised to reflect the latest version and new features (October 2019).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla Firefox is arguably the best browser available that combines strong privacy protection features, good security, active development, and regular updates. The newest version of Firefox is fast, light-weight, and packed full of privacy and security features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason that I consider Firefox to be the best all-around browser for privacy and security. It remains a solid alternative to some of the other options, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great aspect of Firefox is that it is &lt;strong&gt;highly customizable&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the point of this guide. Below we will go over how you can customize Firefox to give you the security and privacy you desire, while still working well for day-to-day browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we jump in, let’s cover some important details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors to consider when configuring Firefox to meet your needs, including your threat model and browsing preferences. In other words, there is no “one-size-fits-all” configuration that will work for everyone. This guide is a basic overview covering some of the different configurations options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start modifying Firefox and installing a bunch of add-ons, it’s important to consider browser fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/browser-fingerprinting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; (or device fingerprinting) is a big topic that covers all the different ways you can be tracked and identified by your system and various settings. All of the different add-ons you install and preference modifications you make to Firefox are inputs that can potentially be used to identify and track you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herein lies the catch-22&lt;/strong&gt;: the more browser add-ons you install and settings you modify, the more likely you will stand out from the crowd and be easier to track. There are solutions for this and the latest version of Firefox does offer &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; fingerprinting protection. I discuss this problem and also provide solutions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/browser-fingerprinting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that leads us to the next point that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More is not always better&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to browser add-ons and modifications, you don’t want to be like that kid who puts every topping imaginable on his ice cream. Similarly, more is not always better with Firefox browser add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the issue of browser fingerprinting, having too many add-ons may slow down performance and break things. Many of the popular Firefox add-ons also fulfill the same functions and are &lt;strong&gt;redundant&lt;/strong&gt; when used together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore it is best to strike a balanced approach. Install and modify &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; what you think will be useful and necessary for your specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proceed with caution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying some of these settings may interfere with your browsing experience and break some websites (they won’t load properly). Therefore taking an &lt;strong&gt;incremental approach may be&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; way to proceed. You can continue to install add-ons and adjust your settings as you see what works best for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows you to modify the settings, create exceptions, or add sites to a whitelist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox privacy settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you get going with Firefox you may want to adjust the following settings for better privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: if you are a Mac OS user, you will see the word “Preferences” in your menu rather than “Options” as it is listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disable telemetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the latest version of Firefox, it is configured to share “&lt;strong&gt;technical and interaction data&lt;/strong&gt;” with Mozilla. This includes the ability to “&lt;strong&gt;install and run studies&lt;/strong&gt;” on your computer. You can learn more about these &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/shield?as=u&amp;amp;utm_source=inproduct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#health-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;data collection&lt;/a&gt; practices, but I’d recommend disabling these settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable go to &lt;strong&gt;Open Menu&lt;/strong&gt; (three bars at the top right corner of the browser) &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Firefox Data Collection and Use&lt;/strong&gt; and then uncheck the boxes as you see below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-55417&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/disable-telemetry-firefox-.png&quot; alt=&quot;disable telemetry firefox&quot; width=&quot;907&quot; height=&quot;279&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/disable-telemetry-firefox-.png 907w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/disable-telemetry-firefox--300x92.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/disable-telemetry-firefox--768x236.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also disable data sharing with Firefox for Android by going to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Data Choices&lt;/strong&gt; and then uncheck all three categories for Telemetry, Crash Reporter, and Mozilla Location Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You can also disable this in the About:Config settings with &lt;strong&gt;toolkit.telemetry.enabled&lt;/strong&gt; set to &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change default search engine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox now uses Google as the default search engine, but there are other &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;private search engines&lt;/a&gt; you can use instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, go to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Default Search Engine&lt;/strong&gt;. Firefox does not provide you with too many alternatives directly in the settings area. However, you can view more options by going down to &lt;strong&gt;One-Click Search Engines&lt;/strong&gt; and then click &lt;strong&gt;Find more search engines&lt;/strong&gt; to see the other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startpage seems to be a pretty good option that gives you good results (from Google) but still respects your privacy. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.startpage.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/199/0/how-do-i-add-startpage-to-firefox-as-a-default-search-engine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;setup instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox also &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; on modifying your search engine preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firefox Content Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great new feature with Firefox is Content Blocking. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/content-blocking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;customizable feature&lt;/a&gt; will automatically block “content that tracks the sites you visit and profiles you.” You can choose between Standard, Strict, and Custom modes, which allow you to block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trackers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyrptominers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fingerprinters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To adjust the Firefox Content Blocking settings, go to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy and Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Content Blocking&lt;/strong&gt; and then select which mode you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-55421&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-content-blocking-.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox content blocking&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-content-blocking-.png 850w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-content-blocking--300x163.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-content-blocking--768x417.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; setting may be the best balance for regular users. Firefox warns that &lt;strong&gt;Strict&lt;/strong&gt; mode may “cause some websites to break.” However, you can still…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disable content blocking for specific sites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to disable content blocking for certain trusted sites. Simply enter the website URL, then click the “i” icon to the left of the address bar, then click the grey button to “&lt;strong&gt;Turn off Blocking for This Site&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-55427&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/turn-off-content-blocking-firefox-.png&quot; alt=&quot;turn off content blocking firefox&quot; width=&quot;393&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/turn-off-content-blocking-firefox-.png 393w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/turn-off-content-blocking-firefox--277x300.png 277w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of Firefox’s Content Blocking feature is that it can save your data and improve page load speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do Not Track (request)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox also has an option to request that websites “do not track” you online. This is simply an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HTTP header field&lt;/a&gt; that you can easily enable. However, the key word here is &lt;strong&gt;request&lt;/strong&gt;, because this is not actually blocking anything. We have also learned that many websites simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/hulu-joined-list-major-platforms-ignore-not-track-requests-185610&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ignore these requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, some websites will abide by this request. To enable Do Not Track, simply go to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Content Blocking&lt;/strong&gt; and then under ‘Send websites a “Do Not Track” signal…’ select &lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-55433&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-do-not-track-.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox do not track&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-do-not-track-.png 800w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-do-not-track--300x52.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-do-not-track--768x133.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enable this in Firefox Android by going to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do not track&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the Do Not Track feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox About:Config settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the general Menu settings we used above, you can also make a number of different modifications using &lt;strong&gt;about:config&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you made all of the changes above, you may notice that some of these settings are already updated in about:config. We will still cover the different about:config since some people prefer to modify settings in this area, rather than through the general Menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access these configuration settings, simply enter &lt;strong&gt;about:config&lt;/strong&gt; into the URL bar and hit enter. You will then be prompted with a warning screen stating “This might void your warranty.” Just click “&lt;strong&gt;I accept the risk&lt;/strong&gt;” to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-55435&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-about.config-changes-.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox about.config changes&quot; width=&quot;626&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-about.config-changes-.png 626w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-about.config-changes--300x115.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After proceeding, you will see a large list of preferences, which each include a status, type, and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These preferences will be listed in alphabetical order and are easily searchable from the search bar near the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28487&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-about-config-changes-.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox about config changes&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-about-config-changes-.png 800w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-about-config-changes--300x174.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-about-config-changes--768x444.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifying preferences&lt;/strong&gt; – You can modify any of these Firefox preferences by simply &lt;strong&gt;double clicking&lt;/strong&gt; the preference name. If the preference is a “boolean” type, then double clicking will change the value to true or false. If the preference is an “integer” or “string” type, double clicking will open a box to change the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my recommended changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;media.peerconnection.enabled&lt;/strong&gt; (WebRTC) = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebRTC stands for “Web Real-Time Communication” and it allows for voice, video chat, and P2P sharing through your browser. Unfortunately, this capability can also &lt;strong&gt;expose your real IP address&lt;/strong&gt; through browser STUN requests, even if you are using a good VPN service. (This is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/webrtc-leaks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WebRTC leak&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable WebRTC in Firefox simply enter &lt;strong&gt;media.peerconnection.enabled&lt;/strong&gt; into the search bar and then double click the value to change it to &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28441&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-webrtc.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox webrtc&quot; width=&quot;819&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-webrtc.png 819w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-webrtc-300x75.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/firefox-webrtc-768x193.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Firefox, the WebRTC vulnerability also affects Chrome, Opera, Brave, and other Chromium-based browsers. Safari is also in the process of implementing WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;privacy.resistFingerprinting = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing this preference to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; will help to make Firefox more resistant to browser fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: There are many factors that go into browser fingerprinting and the ability of an adversary to identify you. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/browser-fingerprinting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; guide for additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;privacy.trackingprotection.fingerprinting.enabled = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new preference with Firefox 67+ to block fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;privacy.trackingprotection.cryptomining.enabled = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new preference with Firefox 67+, this will block cryptominers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;privacy.firstparty.isolate = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing this to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; will isolate cookies to the first party domain, which prevents tracking across multiple domains. First party isolation also does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2017/11/22/how-to-enable-first-party-isolation-in-firefox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;much more&lt;/a&gt; than isolating cookies, it affects: cookies, cache, HTTP Authentication, DOM Storage, Flash cookies, SSL and TLS session resumption, Shared Workers, blob URIs, SPDY and HTTP/2, automated cross-origin redirects, window.name, auto-form fill, HSTS and HPKP supercookies, broadcast channels, OCSP, favicons, mediasource URIs and Mediastream, speculative and prefetched connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preference was added in late 2017 as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tor Uplift Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;long-string-list&quot; readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;dd readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;privacy.trackingprotection.enabled = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new update, this is Mozilla’s built-in tracking protection feature. This will use a Disconnect.me filter list, but may be redundant if you are using uBlock Origin 3rd party filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;h4&gt;geo.enabled = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this to &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt; will disable geolocation tracking, which may be requested by a site you are visiting. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/does-firefox-share-my-location-websites?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;amp;redirectslug=does-firefox-share-my-location-web-sites&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;explained by Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, this preference is enabled by default and utilizes &lt;strong&gt;Google Location Services&lt;/strong&gt; to pinpoint your location. In order to do that, Firefox sends Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;your computer’s IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information about nearby wireless access points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a random client identifier, which is assigned by Google (expires every two weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this data is sent to Google, you would first get a request by the site you are visiting. Therefore you do have control over this, even if geo remains enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;media.navigator.enabled = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this preference to &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt; will block websites from being able to track the microphone and camera status of your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;network.cookie.cookieBehavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an integer type preference with different values. Here are the cookie preference options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0 = Accept all cookies by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 = Only accept from the originating site (block third-party cookies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 = Block all cookies by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 = Block cookies from unvisited sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 = New Cookie Jar policy (prevent storage access to trackers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any selection between 1 and 4 would improve privacy. The New Cookie Jar policy (value 4) offers more protection, but it may also break the functionality of some websites. Ghacks has a discussion of the New Cookie Jar policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/23/firefox-65-new-cookie-jar-policy-to-block-tracking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;network.cookie.lifetimePolicy = 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another integer type preference that you should set to a &lt;strong&gt;value of 2&lt;/strong&gt;. This preference determines when cookies are deleted. Here are the different options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0 = Accept cookies normally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 = Prompt for each cookie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 = Accept for current session only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 = Accept for N days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a value of 2, websites you visit should work without any problems, and all cookies will be automatically deleted at the end of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;network.dns.disablePrefetch = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this preference to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; will disable Firefox from “prefetching” DNS requests. While advanced domain name resolution may slightly improve page load speeds, this also comes with some risks, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/leet10/tech/full_papers/Krishnan.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;network.prefetch-next = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to prefetching DNS requests above, setting this preference to &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt; will prevent pages from being prefetched by Firefox. Mozilla has deployed this feature to speed up web pages that you might visit. However, it will use up resources and poses a risk to privacy. This is another example of performance at the price of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;webgl.disabled = true&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebGL is a potential &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/13799/is-webgl-a-security-concern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;security risk&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it is best disabled by setting &lt;strong&gt;webgl.disabled&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt;. Another issue with WebGL is that it can be used to fingerprint your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get more information on the WebGL issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.contextis.com/blog/webgl-a-new-dimension-for-browser-exploitation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/webgl/security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prevents websites from getting notifications if you copy, paste, or cut something from the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;media.eme.enabled = false&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disables the playback of DRM-controlled HTML5 content. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm#w_opt-out-of-cdm-playback-uninstall-cdms-and-stop-all-cdm-downloads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox “safe browsing” preferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many recommendations to disable the Safe Browsing feature in Firefox due to privacy concerns and potential Google tracking. However, these concerns are based on an &lt;strong&gt;older version&lt;/strong&gt; of the Safe Browsing feature, which would utilize “real-time lookup” of website URLs. This method has not been in use since 2011 – &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/how-safe-browsing-works-in-firefox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;explained further here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a URL is needed, Firefox takes the following precautions to protect user privacy, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/how-safe-browsing-works-in-firefox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;explained by François Marier&lt;/a&gt;, a security engineer for Mozilla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Query string parameters are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/494289c72ba3997183e7b5beaca3e0447ecaf96d/toolkit/components/downloads/ApplicationReputation.cpp#684-710&quot;&gt;stripped&lt;/a&gt; from URLs we check as part of the download protection feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies set by the Safe Browsing servers to protect the service from abuse are stored in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897516&quot;&gt;separate cookie jar&lt;/a&gt; so that they are not mixed with regular browsing/session cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When requesting complete hashes for a 32-bit prefix, Firefox throws in a number of extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/494289c72ba3997183e7b5beaca3e0447ecaf96d/toolkit/components/url-classifier/nsUrlClassifierDBService.cpp#283-289&quot;&gt;“noise” entries&lt;/a&gt; to obfuscate the original URL further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore I would conclude that disabling Safe Browsing would give you no tangible privacy benefits, while also being a security risk. That being said, if you still want to disable this feature, here’s how in the about:config area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browser.safebrowsing.phishing.enabled = false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled = false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Firefox privacy and security add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some great Firefox browser add-ons that will give you more privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: When looking for Firefox add-ons, be sure to consider what you need in relation to the preferences you modified above. Some add-ons will be &lt;strong&gt;redundant&lt;/strong&gt; and not necessary depending on your Firefox preferences and the other add-ons you are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In combination with the preference changes above, my top three recommendations for privacy add-ons would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three of these add-ons complement the preferences listed above, are easy to use, and will probably not break websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great add-on is Cookie AutoDelete. However, if you have already modified your cookie preferences in about:config as described above, then this add-on is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-28528&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ublock-origin.png&quot; alt=&quot;ublock origin&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ublock-origin.png 400w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ublock-origin-264x300.png 264w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; is an efficient, light-weight blocker that filters both ads and tracking. It has risen to popularity as a powerful alternative to Adblock Plus, which allows “acceptable ads” that many users disdain. One added benefit of uBlock Origin is that it can significantly improve performance and page load speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great feature with uBlock Origin is the ability to whitelist certain websites. Given that many sites will block access if they detect an ad-blocker, the ability to whitelist will come in handy. uBlock Origin is free and entirely &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-28531&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-everywhere-.png&quot; alt=&quot;https everywhere firefox&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-everywhere-.png 200w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-everywhere--150x150.png 150w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-everywhere--65x65.png 65w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/https-everywhere--75x75.png 75w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; is a good Firefox add-on that basically forces an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; connection with the websites you visit, provided HTTPS is available for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, more and more websites are implementing HTTPS, so this is becoming less of an issue. Nonetheless, HTTPS Everywhere is still a good add-on to use with Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get more information on HTTPS from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which is behind the creation of this add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-28534&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/decentraleyes-firefox-.png&quot; alt=&quot;decentraleyes firefox&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/decentraleyes-firefox-.png 250w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/decentraleyes-firefox--150x150.png 150w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/decentraleyes-firefox--65x65.png 65w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/decentraleyes-firefox--75x75.png 75w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting Firefox add-on that protects you against tracking via content delivery networks that are operated by third parties. While CDNs do help improve website load time and performance, they are usually offered for free by third-parties that will use the CDN to track your browsing. These third parties include Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Cloudflare, Yandex, Baidu, MaxCDN, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentraleyes solves this problem by hosting CDN resources locally. As described on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;self-hosted GitLab repository&lt;/a&gt;, Decentraleyes “intercepts traffic, finds supported resources locally, and injects them into the environment” thereby preventing CDNs from tracking users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cookie AutoDelete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This browser add-on may not be necessary with Firefox if you have made the changes above to preferences, which will automatically erase cookies that are no longer needed for the website you are viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’d rather use an add-on instead of making these about:config changes, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cookie AutoDelete&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. It erases cookies that are no longer needed, thereby protecting you from tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; is another add-on from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that blocks spying ads and trackers. One drawback with Privacy Badger is that it only blocks third-party sites. Because it considers Google Analytics first-party site, it will not be blocked. Another drawback is that it does not actually use a filter list. Instead, it basically learns as you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Privacy badger is very easy to use and will go a long way to giving you more privacy with general browsing. It can be used in combination with uBlock Origin, although there will be some overlap in terms of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;uMatrix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/umatrix/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;uMatrix&lt;/a&gt; is an advanced add-on that gives you control over requests that may be tracking you on the websites you visit. It is made by the same people behind uBlock Origin. One advantage with uMatrix is that it is very customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One drawback with uMatrix is that it can be difficult and time-consuming to get it configured for regular, day-to-day browsing. However, if you want a powerful blocker, and you don’t mind having to tinker with this plugin, then give uMatrix a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NoScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; is a script-blocker that allows you to identify/block scripts running on websites. While it does give you control, NoScript can be a pain to get configured properly. It breaks many websites, which requires you to tweak and configure the options. If you are already using uBlock Origin, or uMatrix, then you probably don’t need to be using NoScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely not an add-on for the casual user or those who don’t have the patience to devote some time into configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Firefox privacy features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Firefox has been launching some new privacy features. We already discussed the Content Blocking features above and how these are a huge advantage for privacy-conscious users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Firefox has introduced two other features: &lt;strong&gt;DNS over HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt; (DoH) and also a Firefox proxy extension (&lt;strong&gt;Firefox Private Network&lt;/strong&gt;). Interestingly, both of these new features rely on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; infrastructure, which is a large US-based company that provides CDN services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firefox VPN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox officially launched a browser proxy extension called Firefox Private Network, which many refer to as Firefox VPN. While this may be good for some users, I also identified a few drawbacks in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-vpn-private-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox VPN&lt;/a&gt; guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser-only encryption&lt;/strong&gt;: Only traffic through the Firefox browser is getting encrypted. (It’s a proxy, not a VPN.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt;: All traffic is being routed through &lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data collection (logs)&lt;/strong&gt;: As disclosed in the respective privacy policies, Cloudflare will be &lt;strong&gt;logging your source IP address &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; the sites you visit&lt;/strong&gt;. Mozilla is also recording technical, interaction, and registration data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No location selection&lt;/strong&gt;: Unlike other browser-based proxies, Firefox Private Network does not offer any location selection. (It’s either on or off.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare and Mozilla based in the United States (&lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Five Eyes&lt;/a&gt;), there is also concern about &lt;strong&gt;government demands for user data&lt;/strong&gt;, as we’ve seen before with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3004895/riseup-confirms-it-received-two-fbi-warrant-and-gagging-order&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Riseup&lt;/a&gt;. Firefox Private Network remains in beta and only available to US users, but with plans to role it out to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firefox DNS over HTTPS (DoH)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with Firefox Private Network, the implementation of DNS over HTTPS also relies on Cloudflare infrastructure. In fact, it makes &lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare the central processing point for all DNS requests&lt;/strong&gt; in the Firefox browser &lt;strong&gt;by default&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While DNS over HTTPS may sound advantageous in some respects, there are also potential concerns. Rather than going over why, you can read the article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.powerdns.com/2019/09/25/centralised-doh-is-bad-for-privacy-in-2019-and-beyond/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centralised DoH is bad for privacy, in 2019 and beyond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralised DoH is currently a privacy net negative since anyone that could see your metadata can still see your metadata when DNS is moved to a third party. Additionally, that third party then gets a complete log per device of all DNS queries, in a way that can even be tracked across IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if further privacy leaks are plugged, DoH to a third party remains at best a partial solution, one that should not be relied upon as a serious security layer, since it will be hard to plug everything, especially if non-CDN content providers survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encrypting DNS is good, but if this could be done without involving additional parties, that would be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for actual privacy on untrusted networks, nothing beats a VPN, except possibly not using hostile networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people also assume that encrypted third-party DNS will somehow offer privacy and anonymity. This is a false assumption. Your IP address and location remains exposed with everything you do online, while your ISP will still be able to see the websites you visit (IP addresses) even if it’s no longer handling DNS requests. In conclusion, a good VPN will offer much more protection than DoH through Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Firefox go to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; and then scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Network Settings&lt;/strong&gt; and click the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; button. In the box that opens, scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Enable DNS over HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt;, where it can be enabled or &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-55448&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-dns-over-https-doh.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox dns over https doh&quot; width=&quot;1380&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-dns-over-https-doh.png 1380w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-dns-over-https-doh-300x91.png 300w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-dns-over-https-doh-768x233.png 768w, https://cdn-resprivacy.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/firefox-dns-over-https-doh-1024x310.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some additional resources for configuring Firefox to give you more privacy and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;user.js Firefox hardening&lt;/a&gt; – As explained on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;, this is a “&lt;em&gt;configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings. For a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview&quot;&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; wiki page.&lt;/em&gt;” Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wiki page&lt;/a&gt; is also full of great information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/privacy-settings/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Privacy Settings&lt;/a&gt; – This is a Firefox add-on to give you easy access and control of the built-in privacy settings in your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffprofile.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox Profilemaker&lt;/a&gt; – FFprofile helps you to create your own Firefox profile with the default privacy and security settings to fit your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Firefox privacy conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Firefox remains the best all-around, mainstream browser on the market for privacy when it is modified as recommended above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of the configurations and add-ons discussed in this guide will go a long way to giving you more privacy, there is one issue that remains: concealing your IP address and location. To do this, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/best-vpn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;good VPN service&lt;/a&gt; is necessary. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/tor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tor network&lt;/a&gt; also achieves this end, but it comes with the drawbacks of slow speeds, risks, and limitations (only works in a browser).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more options in addition to Firefox, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-browser/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;secure browser&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox’s New WebSocket Inspector</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefoxs-new-websocket-inspector/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefoxs-new-websocket-inspector/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/firefoxdevtools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox DevTools team&lt;/a&gt; and our contributors were hard at work over the summer, getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox 70&lt;/a&gt; jam-packed with improvements. We are especially excited about our new WebSocket inspection feature, because you told us in feedback how important it would be for your daily work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use the inspector now, download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt;, open DevTools’ &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt; panel to find the &lt;em&gt;Messages&lt;/em&gt; tab. Then, keep reading to learn more about WebSockets and the tricks that the new panel has up its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tanhengyeow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Heng Yeow Tan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code (GSoC)&lt;/a&gt; student who’s responsible for the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Primer on WebSockets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WebSocket (WS) API&lt;/a&gt; to create a persistent connection between a client and server. Because the API sends and receives data at any time, it is used mainly in applications requiring real-time communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to work directly with the WS API, some existing libraries come in handy and help save time. These libraries can help with connection failures, proxies, authentication and authorization, scalability, and much more. The WS inspector in Firefox DevTools currently supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://socket.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Socket.IO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SockJS&lt;/a&gt;, but more support is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more about how to set up WebSocket for your client applications? Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MDN’s guides&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, let’s dive into the new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting started with the WebSocket Inspector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WebSocket Inspector is part of the existing &lt;em&gt;Network&lt;/em&gt; panel UI in DevTools. It’s already possible to filter the content for opened WS connections in this panel, but till now there was no chance to see the actual data transferred through WS frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows the WS filter in action. Only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;101 request&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;WebSocket Protocol Handshake&lt;/em&gt;) is visible. The response code indicates that the server is switching to WS connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33855 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Network Monitor panel showing the WS inspection feature&quot; width=&quot;936&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter.png 936w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter-250x72.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter-768x222.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-filiter-500x144.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the 101 request opens the familiar sidebar, showing details about the selected HTTP request. In addition, the UI now offers a fresh new &lt;strong&gt;Messages&lt;/strong&gt; panel that can be used to inspect WS frames sent and received through the selected WS connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33857 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel.png&quot; alt=&quot;The WS inspector in the Network Panel, showing messages&quot; width=&quot;936&quot; height=&quot;399&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel.png 936w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel-250x107.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel-768x327.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-messages-panel-500x213.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live-updated table shows data for sent (green arrow) and received (red arrow) WS frames. Each frame expands on click, so you can inspect the formatted data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To focus on specific messages, frames can be filtered free text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a frame in the list shows a preview at the bottom of the &lt;em&gt;Messages&lt;/em&gt; panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-payload-preview.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33851 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-payload-preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Message showing plain text data sent over WebSocket connection&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-payload-preview.png 512w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-payload-preview-250x249.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-payload-preview-500x498.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspector currently supports the following WS protocols – and we have more planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plain JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socket.IO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SockJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payload based on those protocols is parsed and displayed as an expandable tree for easy inspection. Of course, you can still see the raw data (as sent over the wire) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33858 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing Messages sent via JSON and Socket.IO &quot; width=&quot;919&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview.png 919w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview-250x156.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview-768x480.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/wsi-protocol-preview-500x312.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the pause/resume button in the Network panel toolbar to stop intercepting WS traffic. This allows you to capture only the frames that you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/ws-pause.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33859 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/ws-pause.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of network monitor showing the pause/resume button for WS inspection&quot; width=&quot;936&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/ws-pause.png 936w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/ws-pause-250x24.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/ws-pause-768x72.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/ws-pause-500x47.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s next for the WebSockets inspector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to release this initial feature set quickly to let you use it. We have a few things that we are still working on for upcoming releases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Binary payload viewer&lt;/li&gt;

<title>How we hit our $30k ARR milestone</title>
<link>https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/how-we-hit-our-30k-annual-recurring-revenue-milestone</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/how-we-hit-our-30k-annual-recurring-revenue-milestone</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;15 Oct 2019 - Adriaan van Rossum - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simpleanalytics/blog/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-15-how-we-hit-our-30k-annual-recurring-revenue-milestone.md&quot;&gt;Help improve this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Analytics just passed the $30k in ARR (annual recurring revenue). It’s a little more than one year old and I would like to take you along the important points of that journey together with where I want to take it next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;border&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/images/30k/stripe-mrr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/open&quot;&gt;/open page&lt;/a&gt; for an up to date MRR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-park-bench-to-hacker-news&quot;&gt;From park bench to Hacker News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2018 it saw the light with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/simple-analytics&quot;&gt;its launch on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. It ended up #3 of the day and later won the #3 of the Privacy Golden Kitten Award. I worked on plenty startups before but this was my first public launch. This first day already felt like a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting, however, was the day after. When launching on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18024277&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; (from a bench in Amsterdam with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshuavoydik&quot;&gt;Joshua Voydik&lt;/a&gt;) it really hit a nerve. It reached the #1 spot within the first 5 minutes for at least 9 hours. Let the wild ride begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-and-now-what&quot;&gt;Okay, and now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traction was huge. Although initially, not in the ideal way. I offered a paid version from the start, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/levelsio&quot;&gt;Pieter Levels&lt;/a&gt; suggested via &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat&quot;&gt;WIP&lt;/a&gt; to make it free for a while to get more users. I tried it, but chickened out because I got lots of signups for the free version and none for the paid version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hacker News launch got me my first 30 paying customers and around 800 Twitter followers (before the launch I had around 60). I knew I would be able to get more customers if I knew how to do marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing-whats-that&quot;&gt;Marketing… what’s that?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it’s easy to program and focus on that. But I also knew that my previous startups didn’t make enough money and that wasn’t because of the programming but more the lack of marketing effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I set my goal of programming vs marketing to 50/50. In reality it turned out to be more like 75/25, but it’s already way better than 100/0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good thing to realize is that you can build tools to help you with your marketing. That way I built a dashboard with all Twitter mentions of “privacy analytics” “google analytics alternative”, ….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respond manually to tweets it shows and it helps me in getting my name out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;border&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/images/30k/admin-tweets.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example to gain more customers is through our docs. I put a lot of time and effort in writing our documentation (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thoughtbar_&quot;&gt;Minal C&lt;/a&gt; for being my grammar nazi) and I see a lot of referrers from our docs when people sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;border&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/images/30k/docs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public dashboards also turned out to be a great marketing feature. Customers can decide to put their stats public and share them publicly. That a first in analytics land and great for exposure of my brand. There are plenty tweets out there sharing their dashboard and at the same time they are sharing Simple Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.2203389830508&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read about my Hacker News strategy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingexamples.com/content/drive-traffic-from-hacker-news&quot;&gt;marketingexamples.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-the-basics-right&quot;&gt;Get the basics right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I also made some marketing effort at the beginning, even though I didn’t even realize I was doing it at the time. Before launching, I worked on the project for 2 months. This was from first idea to MVP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat/products/1667/done&quot;&gt;see this page&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to see the first screenshots). The MVP was quite simple: Show a graph of page views and a list of top pages, referrals, and screen sizes. I got most of my pre-launch feedback from people in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat&quot;&gt;WIP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing my process I realized there was some traction: the first samples of Simple Analytics were introduced to the world. I’m not the best with design, so at that moment I also hired a designer to create some pages for the app. That’s not very MVP like, but I didn’t depend on the money I would lose. The same goes for the promotional video on the homepage (although that was through friends) which was a lot of work – but also a lot of fun. These small steps – sharing the process, having a simple MVP, good video, gather feedback early – very likely played a part in the success of Simple Analytics’ initial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-angles-privacy-and-simplicity&quot;&gt;The angles: privacy and simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hold up. A funny video won’t earn you a place on the market, right? The analytics space is dominated by huge players. So the fact that Simple Analytics became a hit was not expected. I stepped into a niche by picking two angles that mean a lot to me: privacy and simplicity. The first has intrigued me since I started programming at the age of 15, and the latter is something that I got from my dad. They are rooted deeply in me and I think that’s one of the reasons I will always be passionate about my startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that those angles would help me this much in comparison with my competitors was something I didn’t expect. For example, Google who started getting a name for being to greedy for data they don’t need was a blessing in disguise. Analytics companies have an urge to collect as much data they can, which usually comes with a horrible interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Analytics doesn’t have that problem because it’s only collecting the needed information so we are still able to show it in a nice clean dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people asked about the churn rate. Here are some numbers to give a little more info than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/open&quot;&gt;simpleanalytics.com/open&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;border&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/images/30k/stripe-churn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;forever-feedbacking&quot;&gt;Forever feedbacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this success story in perspective: it wasn’t all butterflies and rainbows in the last year. Points of improvement and feedback pop up everywhere. I set up lots of ways to gather feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added a link in top navigation, manually tweet a welcome tweet, redirect to feedback page on many pages, a live chat – all thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samilkarahisar&quot;&gt;Şamil Karahisar&lt;/a&gt;, being active on Twitter, a Telegram group with power users, a slack for big features, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;border&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/images/30k/admin-subscriptions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with all this feedback and feature requests it feels like I’m never done with my startup. There are lots of people building a SaaS startup to find their passive income, but it’s hard work (and probably never ends). For me there is this pressure from my customers to build all those nice things they want, which keeps me focused but also overwhelmed. I didn’t expect this and I’m not sure if I found a way. For now it seems to work to have focus weeks, just focus on one feature/theme and get that done in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all wasn’t possible without the feedback and motivation I got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat&quot;&gt;WIP&lt;/a&gt; and my first customers! It comes with pressure but without I would go nowhere, thank you 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next year I want to focus on enterprise clients. It’s a market that really needs a cookie/IP-less solution when GDPR and PECR are enforced. Simple Analytics is the only platform that is compliant for that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to build more tools for bigger users like downloading Excel sheets, dig deeper into the data without making the dashboard more complex, unique visits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/roadmap&quot;&gt;and way more…&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon’s Consumer Business Turned Off Final Oracle Database</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/</guid>
<description>&lt;table id=&quot;amazon-polly-audio-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;amazon-polly-audio-tab&quot;&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;amazon-polly-by-tab&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/polly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a0.awsstatic.com/aws-blog/images/Voiced_by_Amazon_Polly_EN.png&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height=&quot;56&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over my 17 years at Amazon, I have seen that my colleagues on the engineering team are never content to leave good-enough alone. They routinely re-evaluate every internal system to make sure that it is as scalable, efficient, performant, and secure as possible. When they find an avenue for improvement, they will use what they have learned to thoroughly modernize our architectures and implementations, often going so far as to rip apart existing systems and rebuild them from the ground up if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to tell you about an internal database migration effort of this type that just wrapped up after several years of work. Over the years we realized that we were spending too much time managing and scaling thousands of legacy Oracle databases. Instead of focusing on high-value differentiated work, our database administrators (DBAs) spent a lot of time simply keeping the lights on while transaction rates climbed and the overall amount of stored data mounted. This included time spent dealing with complex &amp;amp; inefficient hardware provisioning, license management, and many other issues that are now best handled by modern, managed database services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 teams in Amazon’s Consumer business participated in the migration effort. This includes well-known customer-facing brands and sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=9818047011&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AmazonFresh&quot;&gt;Amazon Fresh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLPWYB7&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/&quot;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopbop.com/&quot;&gt;Shopbop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zappos.com/&quot;&gt;Zappos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as internal teams such as AdTech, Amazon Fulfillment Technology, Consumer Payments, Customer Returns, Catalog Systems, Deliver Experience, Digital Devices, External Payments, Finance, InfoSec, Marketplace, Ordering, and Retail Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migration Complete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am happy to report that this database migration effort is now complete. Amazon’s Consumer business just turned off its final Oracle database (some third-party applications are tightly bound to Oracle and were not migrated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/bye_bye_oracle_1.png&quot; width=&quot;790&quot; height=&quot;256&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We migrated 75 petabytes of internal data stored in nearly 7,500 Oracle databases to multiple AWS database services including &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Redshift&lt;/a&gt;. The migrations were accomplished with little or no downtime, and covered 100% of our proprietary systems. This includes complex purchasing, catalog management, order fulfillment, accounting, and video streaming workloads. We kept careful track of the costs and the performance, and realized the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Reduction&lt;/strong&gt; – We reduced our database costs by over 60% on top of the heavily discounted rate we negotiated based on our scale. Customers regularly report cost savings of 90% by switching from Oracle to AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/strong&gt; – Latency of our consumer-facing applications was reduced by 40%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative Overhead&lt;/strong&gt; – The switch to managed services reduced database admin overhead by 70%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration gave each internal team the freedom to choose the purpose-built &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/&quot;&gt;AWS database service&lt;/a&gt; that best fit their needs, and also gave them better control over their budget and their cost model. Low-latency services were migrated to DynamoDB and other highly scalable non-relational databases such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon ElastiCache&lt;/a&gt;. Transactional relational workloads with high data consistency requirements were moved to Aurora and RDS; analytics workloads were migrated to Redshift, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/&quot;&gt;cloud data warehouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We captured the shutdown of the final Oracle database, and had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9yBP5gnnZi4&quot;&gt;quick celebration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9yBP5gnnZi4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/migration_complete_video_1.png&quot; width=&quot;791&quot; height=&quot;445&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DBA Career Path&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I explained earlier, our DBAs once spent a lot of time managing and scaling our legacy Oracle databases. The migration freed up time that our DBAs now use to do an even better job of performance monitoring and query optimization, all with the goal of letting them deliver a better customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the migration, we also worked to create a fresh career path for our Oracle DBAs, training them to become database migration specialists and advisors. This training includes education on AWS database technologies, cloud-based architecture, cloud security, OpEx-style cost management. They now work with both internal and external customers in an advisory role, where they have an opportunity to share their first-hand experience with large-scale migration of mission-critical databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migration Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are examples drawn from a few of the migrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt; – After the migration, this team was able to double their database fleet size (and their throughput) in minutes to accommodate peak traffic, courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;RDS&lt;/a&gt;. This scale-up effort would have taken months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyer Fraud&lt;/strong&gt; – This team moved 40 TB of data with just one hour of downtime, and realized the same or better performance at half the cost, powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Ledger&lt;/strong&gt; – This team moved 120 TB of data, reduced latency by 40%, cut costs by 70%, and cut overhead by the same 70%, all powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet&lt;/strong&gt; – This team migrated more than 10 billion records to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;, reducing latency by 50% and operational costs by 90% in the process.

<og:description>Over my 17 years at Amazon, I have seen that my colleagues on the engineering team are never content to leave good-enough alone. They routinely re-evaluate every internal system to make sure that it is as scalable, efficient, performant, and secure as possible. When they find an avenue for improvement, they will use what they […]</og:description>
