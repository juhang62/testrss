<description>&lt;p&gt;Carl, I’m impressed

Yes, this does check out with the assumption that the restaurant marks the product at the store level “unavailable” when the ice cream machine goes down &amp;amp; marks it “available” when the machine comes back online. I saw one down I was unaware of &amp;amp; got it fixed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9016833&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;34.769230769231&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9016833&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-9016833&quot; src=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Wealthy.png&quot; alt=&quot;CNBC: Wealthy Families Rush to Transfer Wealth to Children Ahead of Possible Biden Win&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Wealthy.png 737w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Wealthy-300x169.png 300w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Wealthy-640x360.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-9016833&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/rich-kids-could-get-hundreds-of-billions-from-their-parents-if-biden-wins-.html&quot;&gt;10/14/20&lt;/a&gt;): “With the odds growing of a Biden win and possible blue wave, millionaire and billionaire families are speeding up their plans to pass down wealth, real estate and assets to their kids before the end of the year.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America’s super-rich (who have seen their fortunes &lt;a href=&quot;https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/&quot;&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of lockdown) are getting nervous. Last week &lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/rich-kids-could-get-hundreds-of-billions-from-their-parents-if-biden-wins-.html&quot;&gt;10/14/20&lt;/a&gt;) reported that wealthy families are desperately trying to change ownership status of their assets — passing them down to their rich kids — before year’s end, in case of sweeping Biden tax reforms that could lose them millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And corporate media—whose owners are overwhelmingly from the class that would be paying a wealth tax—are returning to throw cold water on the idea, after successfully sidelining the candidates who most enthusiastically promoted taxing the wealthy during the Democratic primaries this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Round One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primaries put the notion of a wealth tax on the political table, with a number of high-profile candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, proposing one. While the idea was popular with the public (&lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2019/02/04/warrens-proposed-tax-on-wealthy-draws-more-support-than-ocasio-cortezs/&quot;&gt;polls show&lt;/a&gt; it was strongly supported, with even half of Republican voters backing it), it was not popular with corporate media pundits, who rejected it as a “bad,” “foolhardy” (&lt;strong&gt;CNN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/17/opinions/wealth-tax-is-bad-idea-andelman/index.html&quot;&gt;2/17/19&lt;/a&gt;) or “terrible” idea (&lt;strong&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/a-wealth-tax-is-a-terrible-idea&quot;&gt;2/15/20&lt;/a&gt;), “bad for workers” (&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/01/28/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax-would-be-bad-for-workers/&quot;&gt;1/28/20&lt;/a&gt;) and an “administrative nightmare” (&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5516903/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-income-assets/&quot;&gt;1/30/19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9016834&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;35.942857142857&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9016834&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9016834&quot; src=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time-Wealth-Tax.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time: Elizabeth Warren’s Wealth Tax on the Super-Rich Is the Wrong Solution to the Right Problem&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time-Wealth-Tax.png 794w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time-Wealth-Tax-300x272.png 300w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time-Wealth-Tax-768x695.png 768w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time-Wealth-Tax-640x580.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-9016834&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5516903/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-income-assets/&quot;&gt;1/30/19&lt;/a&gt;) says of the issue of valuing assets, “Wealthy taxpayers will likely pick a low-end figure, and it will be impossible for the IRS to prove that they are wrong”—a problem that would seem to make property taxes impossible, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A CNN&lt;/strong&gt; opinion piece (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/27/opinions/democrats-wealth-tax-voodoo-economics-mccaffery/index.html&quot;&gt;11/27/19&lt;/a&gt;) warned that it would be just plain “wrong” to claim that a wealth tax is a serious solution, based as it is on “voodoo incantations,” and instead suggested a tax &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; to address inequality. &lt;strong&gt;Fox News&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warrens-wealth-tax-heres-all-the-programs-2020-dem-claims-to-cover-with-funding-trick&quot;&gt;12/31/19&lt;/a&gt;) went even further, attacking the idea as a misguided “fantasy,” before presenting its own dream of any wealth tax being found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/publications/abataxtimes_home/19aug/19aug-pp-johnson-a-wealth-tax-is-constitutional/&quot;&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; (which, to be fair, the current Supreme Court might well do—particularly with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least the pool of interchangeable think tankers and rent-a-pundits pretended to believe inequality is a real problem that they want to fix. Before the great crash of 2008, corporate media were cheerleaders of inequality, the standard line being that it is nothing to worry about, or even a good thing for society (&lt;strong&gt;Extra!&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fair.org/extra/cheerleading-for-inequality/&quot;&gt;9–10/07&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press have now moved one step along, claiming they really do want to solve the inequality issue, only directly addressing it through redistribution won’t work. Thus a &lt;strong&gt;CNN&lt;/strong&gt; op-ed (&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/19/perspectives/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-mistake/index.html&quot;&gt;11/19/19&lt;/a&gt;) argued: “Rising income inequality is indeed a problem for economic growth. But taxing wealth could exacerbate the problem, not fix it.” The authors, two staffers at the right-wing Illinois Policy Institute, claimed that seizing assets from “the world’s best allocators of capital” would stifle innovation and inevitably hurt workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a limited amount of positive coverage of any potential wealth tax. The &lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/opinion/coronavirus-wealth-tax.html&quot;&gt;4/21/20&lt;/a&gt;), for instance, claimed a one-off Covid-19 solidarity assessment on the wealthy would “help prove that we are all in this together.” But this was a break from the normal negativity that claimed it would be too hard to implement (&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/your-money/wealth-tax-warren-sanders.html&quot;&gt;11/15/19&lt;/a&gt;) or simply unconstitutional and dishonest (&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sanders-warren-trump-2020.html&quot;&gt;1/24/20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Round Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden is not proposing any specific wealth tax. The former vice president even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/&quot;&gt;began his campaign&lt;/a&gt; explicitly reassuring wealthy donors that “nothing would fundamentally change” under his presidency. “I need you very badly,” he told them. Yet even with Sanders and Warren defeated, America’s rich are worrying that a President Biden would be swayed by progressive forces in his party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the concept has again become a talking point for the media in recent weeks. And like last time, the tone is overwhelmingly hostile. Thus, a wealth tax simply “won’t work” (&lt;strong&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/10/06/wealth-tax-wont-work/&quot;&gt;10/6/20&lt;/a&gt;), creates “false expectations” (&lt;strong&gt;Toronto Sun&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-heres-why-the-wealth-tax-is-a-bad-idea&quot;&gt;9/22/20&lt;/a&gt;) or might cost more to administer than it would bring in (&lt;strong&gt;Spectator&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/the-problem-with-a-wealth-tax/&quot;&gt;10/8/20&lt;/a&gt;). “A wealth tax is not a solution for income inequality,” insists &lt;strong&gt;Forbes&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ikebrannon/2020/09/29/a-wealth-tax-is-not-a-solution-for-income-inequality/&quot;&gt;9/29/20&lt;/a&gt;), a magazine most noted for its glorification of billionaires, claiming it is a “policy driven by spite” against the rich, and would somehow “make everyone—rich and poor—worse off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9016835&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot; readability=&quot;25.35593220339&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9016835&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-9016835&quot; src=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy.png&quot; alt=&quot;CNBC: Biden defines $400,000 a year as ‘wealthy’: Here’s what that buys in a big city&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; srcset=&quot;https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy.png 796w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy-198x300.png 198w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy-675x1024.png 675w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy-768x1166.png 768w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CNBC-Biden-Wealthy-640x971.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-9016835&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those who make five times the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcountymanhattanboroughnewyork,bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork,queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork,kingscountybrooklynboroughnewyork,richmondcountystatenislandboroughnewyork,newyorkcitynewyork/HSG010219&quot;&gt;median household income&lt;/a&gt; of Manhattan “are not living it up,” &lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/23/jp-morgans-jamie-dimon-on-taxing-the-rich-donald-trumps-tax-cuts.html&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;) reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/biden-defines-400000-a-year-as-wealthy-how-far-it-goes-in-a-city-.html&quot;&gt;10/6/20&lt;/a&gt;) went with the most galaxy-brained line of attack. Biden’s plans categorize anyone in the top 1.8% of income (making $400,000+ annually) as “wealthy.” But those poor souls earning just $400,000 per year “aren’t exactly living large,” &lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; insisted,  finding “experts” willing to claim that that sort of annual income only provided a “relatively middle-class lifestyle” in much of the country. Why, they might only be able to afford three  “modest” family vacations per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/23/jp-morgans-jamie-dimon-on-taxing-the-rich-donald-trumps-tax-cuts.html&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;) also recently sat down with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, uncritically parroting his line that any wealth tax would be “extremely complicated” and “almost impossible,” an interview that was picked up and amplified across the media (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hill&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/finance/517859-dimon-wealth-tax-almost-impossible-to-do&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;New York Post&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/09/23/jamie-dimon-is-ready-to-pay-higher-taxes-just-not-on-his-wealth/&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;MSN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-higher-taxes-on-the-rich-are-ok-but-wealth-tax-is-almost-impossible/vi-BB19leht&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Forbes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/09/23/jamie-dimon-says-go-ahead-and-tax-the-rich-but-wealth-tax-almost-impossible-to-calculate/&quot;&gt;9/23/20&lt;/a&gt;). Wow, who would have thought that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jamie-dimon/&quot;&gt;billionaire&lt;/a&gt; investment banker would oppose a wealth tax! Under even a modest tax hike like Warren’s, Dimon would stand to lose out on tens of millions of dollars annually. Yet this massive, unmissable conflict of interest was not even presented as a problem in these articles, let alone seen as a reason to dismiss his opinion. Rather, he was presented as a neutral expert offering legitimate criticism, rather than a biased actor with a huge amount of skin in the game. In much the same way as reporting that billionaires don’t like socialism is treated as front-page news (&lt;strong&gt;FAIR.org&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fair.org/home/news-flash-billionaires-dont-like-socialism/&quot;&gt;2/3/20&lt;/a&gt;), the super-wealthy being against wealth taxes is apparently also newsworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a wealth tax as modest as some Democrats are proposing would affect precious few Americans, but still generate &lt;a href=&quot;https://docplayer.net/146109027-Response-to-summers-and-sarin-a-wealth-tax-presents-a-revenue-estimation-by-emmanuel-saez-and-gabriel-zucman-uc-berkeley-june-25-2019.html&quot;&gt;trillions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; of revenue from people who have largely been increasing their fortunes throughout the pandemic. That so much of the media are so dead set against the idea suggests whose interests they really serve.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Activists turn facial recognition tools against the police</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/facial-recognition-police.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/facial-recognition-police.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In early September, the City Council in Portland, Ore., met virtually to consider sweeping legislation outlawing the use of facial recognition technology. The bills would not only bar the police from using it to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nbcmiami.com/investigations/miami-police-used-facial-recognition-technology-in-protesters-arrest/2278848/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unmask protesters&lt;/a&gt; and individuals captured in surveillance imagery; they would also prevent companies and a variety of other organizations from using the software to identify an unknown person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the time for public comments, a local man, Christopher Howell, said he had concerns about a blanket ban. He gave a surprising reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I am involved with developing facial recognition to in fact use on Portland police officers, since they are not identifying themselves to the public,” Mr. Howell said. Over the summer, with the city seized by demonstrations against police violence, leaders of the department had told uniformed officers that they could &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/portland-police-allowed-to-cover-name-tags-with-personnel-number-during-protests-at-former-chiefs-direction.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tape over their name&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Howell wanted to know: Would his use of facial recognition technology become illegal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, told Mr. Howell that his project was “a little creepy,” but a lawyer for the city clarified that the bills would not apply to individuals. The Council then passed the legislation in a unanimous vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell was offended by Mr. Wheeler’s characterization of his project but relieved he could keep working on it. “There’s a lot of excessive force here in Portland,” he said in a phone interview. “Knowing who the officers are seems like a baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell, 42, is a lifelong protester and self-taught coder; in graduate school, he started working with neural net technology, an artificial intelligence that learns to make decisions from data it is fed, such as images. He said that the police had tear-gassed him during a midday protest in June, and that he had begun researching how to build a facial recognition product that could defeat officers’ attempts to shield their identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This was, you know, kind of a ‘shower thought’ moment for me, and just kind of an intersection of what I know how to do and what my current interests are,” he said. “Accountability is important. We need to know who is doing what, so we can deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell is not alone in his pursuit. Law enforcement has used facial recognition to identify criminals, using photos from government databases or, through a company called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt;, from the public internet. But now activists around the world are turning the process around and developing tools that can unmask law enforcement in cases of misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It doesn’t surprise me in the least,” said Clare Garvie, a lawyer at Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy and Technology. “I think some folks will say, ‘All’s fair in love and war,’ but it highlights the risk of developing this technology without thinking about its use in the hands of all possible actors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The authorities targeted so far have not been pleased. The New York Times reported in July 2019 that Colin Cheung, a protester in Hong Kong, had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/hong-kong-protests-facial-recognition-surveillance.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;developed a tool to identify police officers&lt;/a&gt; using online photos of them. After he posted a video about the project on Facebook, he was arrested.

Mr. Cirio, 41, took the photos down after France’s interior minister &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GDarmanin/status/1311688550073724931&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatened legal action&lt;/a&gt; but said he hoped to republish them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s about the privacy of everyone,” said Mr. Cirio, who believes facial recognition should be banned. “It’s childish to try to stop me, as an artist who is trying to raise the problem, instead of addressing the problem itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many police officers around the world cover their faces, in whole or in part, as captured in recent videos of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/europe/beatings-detentions-belarus-lukashenko.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;police violence in Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, Andrew Maximov, a technologist from the country who is now based in Los Angeles, uploaded a video to YouTube that demonstrated how facial recognition technology could be used to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJIrnphTFg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;digitally strip away the masks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the simulated footage, software matches masked officers to full images of officers taken from social media channels. The two images are then merged so the officers are shown in uniform, with their faces on display. It’s unclear if the matches are accurate. The video, which was reported earlier by a news site about Russia called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/10/01/you-have-no-masks&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meduza&lt;/a&gt;, has been viewed more than one million times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“For a while now, everyone was aware the big guys could use this to identify and oppress the little guys, but we’re now approaching the technological threshold where the little guys can do it to the big guys,” Mr. Maximov, 30, said. “It’s not just the loss of anonymity. It’s the threat of infamy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These activists say it has become relatively easy to build facial recognition tools thanks to off-the-shelf image recognition software that has been made available in recent years. In Portland, Mr. Howell used a Google-provided platform, TensorFlow, which helps people build machine-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The technical process — I’m not inventing anything new,” he said. “The big problem here is getting quality images.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell gathered thousands of images of Portland police officers from news articles and social media after finding their names on city websites. He also made a public records request for a roster of police officers, with their names and personnel numbers, but it was denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook has been a particularly helpful source of images. “Here they all are at a barbecue or whatever, in uniform sometimes,” Mr. Howell said. “It’s few enough people that I can reasonably do it as an individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell said his tool remained a work in progress and could recognize only about 20 percent of Portland’s police force. He hasn’t made it publicly available, but he said it had already helped a friend confirm an officer’s identity. He declined to provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0&quot; aria-label=&quot;media&quot; role=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;associatedMedia&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemid=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/25/business/21coprecognition-exhibit/21coprecognition-exhibit-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;css-1l44abu ewdxa0s0&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;For an exhibit called “Capture,” Mr. Cirio collected police officers’ faces from 1,000 photos he had gathered from the internet and from photographers who attended protests in France.

He declined to comment on Mr. Howell’s software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Older attempts to identify police officers have relied on crowdsourcing. The news service ProPublica asks readers to identify officers in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/protest-police-videos/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of videos of police violence. In 2016, an anti-surveillance group in Chicago, the Lucy Parsons Lab, started &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://openoversight.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenOversight&lt;/a&gt;, a “public searchable database of law enforcement officers.” It asks people to upload photos of uniformed officers and match them to the officers’ names or badge numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We were careful about what information we were soliciting. We don’t want to encourage people to follow officers to playgrounds with their kids,” said Jennifer Helsby, OpenOversight’s lead developer. “It has resulted in officers being identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For example, the database helped journalists at the Invisible Institute, a local news organization, identify Chicago officers who &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-baton-use-of-force-protests/Content?oid=80849109&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;struck protesters with batons&lt;/a&gt; this summer, according to the institute’s director of public strategy, Maira Khwaja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Photos of more than 1,000 officers have been uploaded to the site, Ms. Helsby said, adding that versions of the open-source database have been started in other cities, including Portland. That version is called Cops.Photo, and is one of the places from which Mr. Howell obtained identified photos of police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Howell originally wanted to make his work publicly available, but is now concerned that distributing his tool to others would be illegal under the city’s new facial recognition laws, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I have sought some legal advice and will seek more,” Mr. Howell said. He described it as “unwise” to release an illegal facial recognition app because the police “are not going to appreciate it to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’d be naïve not to be a little concerned about it,” he added. “But I think it’s worth doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;FILE PHOTO: Edward Snowden speaks via video link during a news conference in New York City, U.S. September 14, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has granted U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden permanent residency rights, his lawyer said on Thursday, a step towards Russian citizenship if he wants it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Snowden, 37, fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after leaking secret files in 2013 that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency where he was a contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;U.S. authorities have for years wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“His (Russian) residency permit was expiring and we asked to extend it,” Anatoly Kucherena, his Russian lawyer, told Reuters. Kucherena said the coronavirus pandemic had made the process longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“We submitted the documents in April and we got the permanent residency rights (on Thursday),” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Separately, Kucherena told the TASS news agency that Snowden was not considering applying for a Russian passport at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump said in August he was considering a pardon for Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Snowden keeps a low profile in Russia. He has praised the country’s natural beauty and the warmth of its people, while using social media to criticise government policy from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hackers extorted $1.14M from UCSF</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Most ransomware attacks begin with a booby-trapped emaiI and research suggests criminal gangs are increasingly using tools that can gain access to systems via a single download. In the first week of this month alone, Proofpoint's cyber-security analysts say they saw more than one million emails with using a variety of phishing lures, including fake Covid-19 test results, sent to organisations in the US, France, Germany, Greece, and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple launched four new iPhones including the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Out of all the four new releases, only two will be available in India for now- the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. Soon after the new iPhones were announced, Apple discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone Pro Max. The company also reduced the prices of its existing iPhones including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR, and iPhone SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple iPhone 12 is priced starts at Rs 69,900 for the base variant whereas the iPhone 12 Pro costs Rs 1,19,900 for the base variant. Well, that is not something unexpected. Considering the previous trends, the iPhone Pro models are released with an exorbitant price tag. Now to add to the woes of people looking to buy the iPhone 12 Pro, they should know that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro is more expensive in India than in any other country. Dubai for instance sells the iPhone 12 Pro for Rs 84,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this rings a bell. The iPhone 12 Pro is comparatively cheaper in Dubai. So cheap that you can actually go to Dubai, buy the phone and come back. Let us explain the math to you for a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Price in India for 128 GB:&lt;/strong&gt; Rs 1,19,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Price in Dubai for 128GB:&lt;/strong&gt; Rs 84,000. It costs Dh 4,199 in Dubai and if you convert the currency to INR, the price comes down to almost Rs 84,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should this mean that you can go to Dubai, buy the phone and then come back? Well, if you ask me. It is not that bad an idea. The 12 Pro will go on sale from November 6. So you book a flight for Dubai from Delhi or Kolkata for November 6 or later than that, you can get the return ticket for a little over Rs 18,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the exact amount, you would be spending on your flight tickets to Dubai from New Delhi. However, the amount might change depending on the availability but this is what we found when tried booking a ticket to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight ticket: Indigo Rs 17929 approx&lt;br/&gt;iPhone 12 Pro 128GB: 84,000&lt;br/&gt;Some other expenses: Around Rs 10,000&lt;br/&gt;Total: Around Rs 1,11,929&lt;br/&gt;Money saved: Around Rs 8000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;itgimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202010/Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_12.19-1200x742.png?EZDB1F4V_MBUFqe1VNjueddsHKGJgQ7S&quot; src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image370x208.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, considering that the world is battling coronavirus pandemic and the virus is in no mood to slow down, we do not encourage anyone to travel. The whole idea was to not send you to Dubai but to draw your attention towards Apple’s exorbitant pricing in India. It is no secret that the taxes and duties that are applied to imported phones are highest in India. The taxes are so high that for an important iPhone that you will end up paying an average tax of Rs 24,000 for something like an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the sky-rocketing prices, iPhone still sells best in India and the buyers give whatever price Apple asks them to pay. So for a business, that is not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-1&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot;&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;Slow breathing practices have gained popularity in the western world due to their claimed health benefits, yet remain relatively untouched by the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;list-item-2&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-4&quot;&gt;Investigations into the physiological effects of slow breathing have uncovered significant effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot;&gt;Key findings include effects on respiratory muscle activity, ventilation efficiency, chemoreflex and baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, blood flow dynamics, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, cardiorespiratory coupling, and sympathovagal balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot;&gt;There appears to be potential for use of controlled slow breathing techniques as a means of optimising physiological parameters that appear to be associated with health and longevity, and that may extend to disease states; however, there is a dire need for further research into the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-12&quot;&gt;The last decade has seen the emergence of literature documenting the effects and potential clinical benefits of slow breathing techniques, predominantly in disease states. The physiological effects of slow breathing in the healthy human, however, are yet to be comprehensively reviewed. Documented effects predominantly span the cardiovascular, autonomic, respiratory, endocrine and brain systems. The aim of this review is to provide a core definition of slow breathing, and summarise the major documented effects in healthy humans in order to form a knowledge base of the physiology and proposed mechanisms of slow breathing techniques upon which potential clinical applications can be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;History of slow breathing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-13&quot;&gt;The act of controlling one’s breath for the purpose of restoring or enhancing one’s health has been practiced for thousands of years amongst Eastern cultures. For example, yogic breathing (pranayama) is a well-known ancient practice of controlled breathing, often performed in conjunction with meditation or yoga, for its spiritual and perceived health-enhancing effects [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Various forms of pranayama exist, such as nostril breathing (double, single or alternate), abdominal breathing, forceful breathing and vocalised (chanting) breathing, which are performed at varying rates and depths [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-1-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-2-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Yoga, and hence pranayama, was first introduced to the West in the late 1800s and its popularity rose in the mid-1900s. Breathing techniques have since become increasingly popular due to a rising interest in holistic and wellness approaches to healthcare. Their claimed health benefits and potential to treat a range of medical conditions has piqued the interest of the medical and scientific communities, and stimulated research into the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-14&quot;&gt;Since the 1990s, a system of breathing therapy developed within the Russian medical community by Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko has made its way across several continents: the Buteyko method. K.P. Buteyko began treating patients with respiratory and circulatory diseases using breathing retraining in the 1950s and 1960s [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-3-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. Buteyko and other clinicians who adopted his methods claimed success in treating a wide range of chronic disorders, though it was some time before the method spread to other countries [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-4-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. Several clinical trials and Cochrane reviews have since investigated the effectiveness of the Buteyko method in the treatment of asthma, with more studies and consistent findings necessary in order to support reported promising results [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-5-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-10-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;sec-5&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Review methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-15&quot;&gt;Our objective was to provide a comprehensive review for respirologists, physiologists, and clinicians and researchers outside of the field. The review focuses on the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, cardiorespiratory unit and autonomic nervous system. Each section begins with a brief overview of the physiology of that system during normal respiration, followed by discussion of the researched physiological effects of slow breathing in healthy humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-16&quot;&gt;For the purpose of this review, we define slow breathing as any rate from 4 to 10 breaths per min (0.07–0.16 Hz). The typical respiratory rate in humans is within the range of 10–20 breaths per min (0.16–0.33 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-17&quot;&gt;We initially performed a Medline search &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; PubMed for articles reviewing or reporting on the effects of breathing at 4–10 breaths per min or 0.07–0.16 Hz in humans. Investigations of breathing outside of this range were excluded, as were those that incorporated respiratory load, continuous positive airway pressure machines or other breathing apparatus, and/or other breathing techniques and/or meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise or dietary interventions, and so forth. The Medline search expanded during the writing of the manuscript to incorporate literature pertaining to the normal physiology of the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, and other topics relevant to the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;sec-13&quot; readability=&quot;75.66044387932&quot;&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;sec-14&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;47.435294117647&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heart rate variability and the baroreflex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-26&quot;&gt;The instantaneous heart rate can be measured on an ECG recording as the time between beats: the R–R interval. Fluctuation of R–R intervals is a physiological occurrence known as heart rate variability (HRV). HRV and blood pressure fluctuations occur both randomly and rhythmically. Power spectral analysis of these fluctuations shows two significantly correlated rhythmic oscillations indicated by a peak at a frequency around 0.25 Hz (high frequency (HF)) and another at around 0.1 Hz (low frequency (LF)) [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-49-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-50-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;]. The HF oscillations coincide with the typical respiration frequency (&lt;em&gt;i.e&lt;/em&gt;. 15 breaths per min, 0.25 Hz) and, hence, are related to the phasic effects of tidal respiration on the cardiovascular system (mechanical, haemodynamic and cardiorespiratory mechanisms), whereas LF oscillations are thought to correspond to cardiac feedback mechanisms that are slower than and independent of respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-50-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-52-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-27&quot;&gt;The baroreceptor reflex (baroreflex) is a negative feedback mechanism involving stretch receptors, present primarily in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, that monitor arterial blood pressure and respond to acute changes &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; central–neural–autonomic pathways, which we will discuss in more depth in later sections. Briefly, arterial baroreceptors are activated by an increase in blood pressure and fire signals &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; afferent nerves to the cardiovascular centre in the medulla oblongata, which relays fast parasympathetic efferent signals &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; the vagus nerve to the sinoatrial (SA) node to decrease heart rate, while sympathetic efferent signals relayed &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; the sympathetic chain in the thoracic spinal column to the heart and blood vessels are suppressed, adding to decreased heart rate, cardiac output and vasomotor tone (reviewed by W&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;ehrein&lt;/span&gt; and J&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;oyner&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-53-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;]). Baroreceptor activity is reduced when blood pressure is low, resulting in the reverse effects. LF oscillations of arterial blood pressure (known as Mayer waves) are thought to represent the sympathetic arm of the baroreflex, which oscillates slower than respiration at 0.1 Hz [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-51-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-54-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-55-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;]. The baroreflex is therefore tightly coupled to, perhaps even predominantly accountable for, LF HRV oscillations [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-51-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-56-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-59-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-28&quot;&gt;HF HRV and baroreflex activity are influenced by the phasic effects of respiration, with the rate of respiration modulating the relationship between the HRV and blood pressure oscillations [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-60-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;]. It has been indicated that slow breathing causes the pulse harmonics of blood flow (&lt;em&gt;i.e&lt;/em&gt;. blood pressure oscillations) to synchronise with the rhythm of the heart [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-29-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. Various studies have found that slow breathing increases amplitudes of blood pressure oscillations and HRV, and that this is particularly significant at a respiration rate of 6 breaths per min (0.1 Hz) [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-21-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-61-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-64-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;]. At 6 breaths per min, the LF HRV oscillations are said to be augmented by respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-65-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-66-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;]. For example, a study in healthy males in which carotid baroreceptors were stimulated by neck suction during paced respiration found that the influence of the arterial baroreflex on the heart rate and blood pressure was enhanced during respiration at 6 breaths per min [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-41-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, studies on the effects of respiratory phase time ratio have reported a tendency for baroreflex sensitivity and HRV amplitude to increase when the inspiration/expiration ratio is 1/1 during slow breathing at 0.1 Hz [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-67-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-69-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;]. The rhythmic influence of phasic respiration on HRV is a physiological phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-15&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;54.92757907183&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Respiratory sinus arrhythmia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-29&quot;&gt;Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is HRV in synchrony with the phases of respiration, whereby R–R intervals are shortened during inspiration and lengthened during expiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-71-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;]. Typically, RSA has a frequency of 0.25 Hz (&lt;em&gt;i.e&lt;/em&gt;. respiratory frequency) as reflected in the HF HRV oscillation peak. RSA frequency therefore changes with respiration rate and this is known to result in a shift in the phase difference between respiration and HRV (the heart rate response) and a change in the amplitude of HRV. This was first reported by A&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;ngelone&lt;/span&gt; and C&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;oulter&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-72-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;] in an early continuous recording of RSA in a healthy human, which demonstrated that as the respiration rate was reduced, the phase difference was shortened, until at rate of 4 breaths per min, where HRV and inspiration/expiration were in exact phase; yet it was at 6 breaths per min (0.1 Hz), where the phase difference was at 90°, that maximisation of HRV amplitude was observed. Maximisation of RSA/HRV at around 6 breaths per min has since been confirmed by numerous studies [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-65-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-73-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-74-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;]. This indicates cardiorespiratory system resonance and is hence referred to as a “resonant frequency effect” [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-72-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-75-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;].

&lt;p id=&quot;p-31&quot;&gt;RSA is thought to have a distinct physiological significance, though it has not been fully elucidated. Studies have indicated that one possible function of RSA is to enhance pulmonary gas exchange efficiency by entraining cardiovascular oscillations within the phases of respiration, thereby matching ventilation and perfusion to heart rate and hence pulmonary blood flow, and reducing physiologic dead space [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-45-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-47-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-48-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-78-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-78&quot;&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-79-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-79&quot;&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;]. It has been further hypothesised that RSA has an intrinsic role in the resting state of the cardiorespiratory system, as improving pulmonary gas exchange efficiency would minimise energy expenditure, which is supported by the fact that RSA maximises during sleep, relaxation, slow, deep respiration, and when supine, and is reduced during exercise and states of anxiety (reviewed by H&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;ayano&lt;/span&gt; and Y&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;asuma&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-80-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-80&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;]). An alternate hypothesis is that RSA minimises cardiac work while maintaining appropriate blood gas concentrations and that this is emphasised during slow, deep respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-74-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-81-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-81&quot;&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;]. Studies have also pointed towards a role of RSA in buffering systemic blood flow oscillations resulting from respiratory-driven variations in venous filling and stroke volume of the left heart [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-29-5&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-35-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;].

&lt;h3&gt;Mechanisms of RSA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-32&quot;&gt;The precise mechanisms underlying RSA have been extensively explored, yet this topic remains relatively unsolved and under intense debate. The debate largely revolves around whether the baroreflex or a central respiratory centre predominantly generates RSA [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-82-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-82&quot;&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;]. Settlement of this debate is impeded by the lack of consistency between experimental methods, study population heterogeneity and, hence, a lack of converging results, confounding variables, and the inability to truly determine cause and effect. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that the genesis of RSA involves a network of central, peripheral and mechanical elements that are likely interacting bidirectionally and contributing synergistically to HRV [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-36-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-38-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-83-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-83&quot;&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-33&quot;&gt;The first layer of RSA generation involves mechanical factors such as changes in venous return, stroke volume and cardiac output that are driven by the respiratory swings in intrathoracic/intrapleural pressure, causing heart rate and blood pressure oscillations [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-52-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;]. The baroreflex is also theorised to drive HRV in response to the respiratory swings in arterial blood pressure [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-25-5&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-57-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-74-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-84-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-84&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-86-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-86&quot;&gt;86&lt;/a&gt;]. Additional peripheral elements known to contribute to RSA include the peripheral chemoreflex [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-87-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-87&quot;&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;], the Bainbridge reflex (atrial stretch receptors that respond to increases in blood volume during inspiration (when venous filling increases) by increasing heart rate [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-88-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-88&quot;&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-89-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;]) and the Hering–Breuer reflex (slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors activated by moderate to excessive lung inflation that invoke increased respiratory drive and heart rate) [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-71-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-90-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-91-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-91&quot;&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;]. Augmentation of these mechanical elements and peripheral reflexes can be achieved by slow, deep breathing, which would contribute to the observed increases in RSA amplitude (reviewed by B&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;illman&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-38-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-34&quot;&gt;The central theory of RSA revolves around respiratory and cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata that converge to generate cardiorespiratory rhythms. The theory implicates a “neural pacemaker”: oscillations of cardiorespiratory neuron activity that generate an intrinsic rhythm that regulates both systems [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-92-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-92&quot;&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;]. These pacemaker neurons have been identified within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the nucleus ambiguus, oscillations of which are reportedly in phase with respiratory phrenic nerve activity, and which are able to produce an intrinsic cardiorespiratory rhythm that regulates the heart rate &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; autonomic efferents along the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) and the cardiac sympathetic nerves to the SA node (reviewed by B&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;erntsen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;]). Whilst this neural pacemaker has an intrinsic rhythm, it is embedded in a complex network of neural pathways and inputs, including those of the mechanical and peripheral reflexes that are received by the neurons in the NTS [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-90-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-90&quot;&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-35&quot;&gt;The proposal of a “respiratory gate” was an attempt to characterise the autonomic modulation of the heart beat by the cardiorespiratory centres. It was postulated that “inspiratory neurons” in the NTS constitute a gating mechanism, the opening and closing of which is synchronised to the phases of respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-93-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;]. Closing of the gate coincides with inspiration and pulmonary stretch receptor activation, while opening of the gate coincides with expiration, allowing autonomic efferents relaying activity from peripheral reflexes that accumulate within the NTS to flow into the nucleus ambiguus and be delivered to the heart [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-93-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;]. This would support respiratory modulation of autonomic outflow as the primary generator of RSA [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-39-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Parasympathetic &lt;em&gt;versus&lt;/em&gt; sympathetic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-36&quot;&gt;Simplistically, it can be said that the two arms of the autonomic nervous system exert opposing control over the heart. Cardiac parasympathetic efferents are relayed &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; the vagus nerve and induce cardiac slowing &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; acetylcholine release, while sympathetic efferents are relayed &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; a network of nerves within the sympathetic chain of the thoracic spinal column and accelerate the heart rate &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; norepinephrine release [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-94-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;]. Both systems display an intrinsic, tonic rhythm that is generated by a central neural mechanism; however, vagal activity is capable of eliciting a much faster influence on the heart than sympathetic activity, presumably due to faster signal transduction and acetylcholine-receptor kinetics, such that it is capable of delaying the immediate heartbeat and, hence, able to modulate the heart rate at higher frequencies, while cardiac sympathetic influence drops off at ∼0.1 Hz [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-89-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-95-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, acetylcholine inhibits noradrenaline release and overshadows noradrenaline at the SA node; hence, parasympathetic activity is said to be the dominant arm of the autonomic nervous system, providing a homeostatic background level of control over the heart rate under resting conditions [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-95-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-98-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-98&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;]. Sympathetic activity is presumably minimal or absent under resting conditions in healthy humans, whereas it is high in various disease states, and in healthy humans during exercise, and physical and mental perturbations [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-51-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-94-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-94&quot;&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-37&quot;&gt;HRV is therefore largely a product of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-38-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;]. HF HRV oscillations are thought to be predominantly parasympathetically mediated, while LF HRV oscillations are thought to be both sympathetically and parasympathetically mediated, depending on the circumstances as mentioned earlier [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-49-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-99-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-99&quot;&gt;99&lt;/a&gt;]. HRV is therefore regarded as a qualitative index of “sympathovagal balance”, reflecting the weight of parasympathetic &lt;em&gt;versus&lt;/em&gt; sympathetic autonomic control, whereby a higher LF/HF HRV ratio reflects sympathetic dominance and a lower ratio reflects parasympathetic dominance [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-100-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-100&quot;&gt;100&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-102-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-102&quot;&gt;102&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

Autonomic outflows are inhibited during inspiration and disinhibited during expiration: the respiratory gate theory [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-39-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-52-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-93-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-93&quot;&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;]. Respiratory phase influence on cardiovagal activity is thought to be far more significant; however, due to a more direct central–neural driving mechanism, and the speed of parasympathetic signal transduction and effect that would allow for heart rate modulation at all respiratory frequencies [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-5&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-89-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-89&quot;&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;]. Sympathetic bursts do occur when the gate is open during expiration, however, there is a much greater response lag compared to parasympathetic action, and they are also less effective the greater the vagal activity due to suppression of noradrenaline release and effect [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-39-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-95-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-95&quot;&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-96-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-96&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-98-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-98&quot;&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;]. Adding to this, the observed correlation between phasic parasympathetic vagal activity (“vagal tone”) with respiratory phase-related HRV oscillations underpins the hypothesis that RSA is largely a vagal phenomenon [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-71-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-103-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-39&quot;&gt;Using power spectral analysis corrected for respiratory influence, the effect of respiration rate on autonomic activity can be assessed using LF/HF power and time domain indices [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-65-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;]. Using this method, C&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;hang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-42-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;] reported a shift towards parasympathetic balance and an increase in vagal activity in healthy humans who breathed at 8 breaths per min, as opposed to 12 and 16 breaths per min. Similarly, Z&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;hang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-103-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt;] performed an investigation in healthy humans breathing at 8 (slow), 12 (average) and 18 (fast) breaths per min using time domain analysis to characterise the respiration response curves of vagal activity. They found that slow breathing augmented vagal power by entraining vagally induced cardiac resetting to the phases of respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-97-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-97&quot;&gt;97&lt;/a&gt;]. It has also been shown that during controlled, slow, deep breathing, the respiratory phase modulation of sympathetic activity is stronger, such that more complete inhibition is observed during early inspiration to mid expiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-104-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-104&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt;]. It has been suggested that in order to achieve a long-term shift towards parasympathetic dominance, prolonged practice of slow breathing is necessary, as was observed in healthy humans who practiced slow breathing regularly for 3 months [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-105-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-105&quot;&gt;105&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-40&quot;&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;aylor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-76-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-76&quot;&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;] examined the effects of sympathetic blockade on RSA in healthy humans at varying respiration rates (15–3 breaths per min) and found that RSA was enhanced when cardiac sympathetic activity was blocked at all respiratory frequencies. Their results also indicated that tonic vagal activity is constant across respiratory frequencies, to which they speculated that during fast breathing, less acetylcholine is released as expiration is shortened; thus, RSA is reduced. Conversely, whilst at resonant frequency (6 breaths per min), acetylcholine release and hydrolysis is optimised; hence, RSA is maximised. Further to this point, W&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;ang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-67-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;] observed a tendency for increased HRV at 6 breaths per min when the inspiration/expiration ratio was 1/1, and based their explanation on optimal acetylcholine release and hydrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-41&quot;&gt;Conversely, researchers have postulated that at 6 breaths per min, while sympathetic activity is not necessarily changed, sympathetic bursts may also contribute to HRV, probably due to baroreflex and Mayer wave integration at this respiratory frequency [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-65-4&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-70-6&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;]. In the study by Z&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;hang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-103-3&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-103&quot;&gt;103&lt;/a&gt;], whilst they observed an increase in vagal power with slow breathing, sympathetic power did not significantly change; however, a change in the pattern of sympathetic bursts within breaths was observed (also reported by K&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;oizumi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-96-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-96&quot;&gt;96&lt;/a&gt;], S&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;eals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-104-2&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-104&quot;&gt;104&lt;/a&gt;] and L&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;imberg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-106-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-106&quot;&gt;106&lt;/a&gt;]). On a similar note, V&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;idigal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-107-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-107&quot;&gt;107&lt;/a&gt;] conducted an investigation into the effects of slow respiration (6 breaths per min) on autonomic response to postural manoeuvre. Slow breathing improved cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic responsiveness to physical perturbations, which they suggested may be a result of augmented baroreflex sensitivity due to increased (initial) parasympathetic tone, and synchronisation of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems at 6 breaths per min. Therefore, it is not to be mistaken that slow breathing practice should minimise sympathetic activity, but rather, that it appears capable of achieving optimal sympathovagal balance, and enhancing autonomic reactivity to physical and mental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-42&quot;&gt;The physiological effects of slow breathing are indeed vast and complex. A simplified model of the respiratory–central nervous system–cardiovascular interaction network is presented in &lt;a id=&quot;xref-fig-2-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-fig&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#F2&quot;&gt;figure 2&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-108-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-108&quot;&gt;108&lt;/a&gt;]. From this review, it can be seen that the breathing pattern, as defined by respiratory rate, tidal volume, diaphragmatic activation, respiratory pauses and passive &lt;em&gt;versus&lt;/em&gt; active expiration, has a profound effect not only on respiration efficiency but also extending to cardiovascular function and autonomic function, where the effects are bidirectional.

&lt;h3&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-46&quot;&gt;Variations in respiratory parameters can occur within the normal population in the absence of respiratory diseases; however, traditional medicine has not attempted to define what may constitute optimised respiration within the normal population, and given the profound effect on vagal tone, what constitutes “autonomically optimised respiration”. Perhaps it is time to refine a breathing technique that optimises ventilation, gas exchange and arterial oxygenation, maximises vagal tone, maintains parasympathetic–sympathetic balance and optimises the amount of cardiorespiratory reserve that could be called upon in times of intense physical or mental stress or activity. According to the studies reviewed here, “autonomically optimised respiration” would appear to be in the band of 6–10 breaths per min, with an increased tidal volume that is achieved by diaphragmatic activation. Although not reviewed here, nasal breathing is also considered an important component of optimised respiration [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-109-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-109&quot;&gt;109&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-110-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-110&quot;&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;]. This is easily achievable in most individuals with simple practise and there is yet to appear in the literature any documented adverse effects of respiration in the 6–10 breaths per min range. Controlled, slow breathing appears to be an effective means of maximising HRV and preserving autonomic function, both of which have been associated with decreased mortality in pathological states and longevity in the general population [&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-41-6&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-111-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-111&quot;&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a id=&quot;xref-ref-119-1&quot; class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298#ref-119&quot;&gt;119&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;sec-22&quot; class=&quot;subsection&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-47&quot;&gt;Specific physiological variables have been examined primarily during short-term performance of spontaneous and controlled slow breathing in a controlled environment, while recordings during sustained practice of slow breathing are scarce. Of great scientific interest is the effect of long-term practice of slow breathing. Research could subsequently expand into whether controlled slow breathing can optimise physiological variables in pathological conditions (not limited to the respiratory system). A hierarchy of research will provide a foundation upon which any therapeutic claims can be tested and validated.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The physiological effects of slow breathing in the healthy human</og:title>
<og:url>https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298</og:url>
<og:description>Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion. Key points Educational aims Slow breathing techniques have been used in asthma but are there effects in healthy individuals? &lt;http://ow.ly/gCPO30eQOPZ&gt;</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to create a next-generation protocol based on years of knowledge and experience with OAuth 2 are being held at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-gnap/&quot;&gt;GNAP working group&lt;/a&gt; at the IETF. When it reaches maturity and if there's IETF consensus to do so, the community may decide to adopt it as the next version of OAuth. The new specification will encompass many more use cases than OAuth originally set out to solve. Questions, suggestions and protocol changes should be discussed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/txauth&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/core-protocol&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Antitrust Notes</title>
<link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/10/20/Google-Antitrust</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/10/20/Google-Antitrust</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I just read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7273457/10-20-20-US-v-Google-Complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;US antitrust “Complaint”&lt;/a&gt; against Google. This is obviously just the first chapter of a very long story, but here are early observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get upset that this is going to take years to work through. Figuring out how to unclench Google’s stranglehold on the Internet wouldn’t be easy even without their army of excellent lawyers fighting tooth and claw every step of the way, which they will be. It’s still worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the Complaint document to be well-written and well-argued. You don’t need to be an antitrust attorney, or any kind of lawyer at all, to understand its argument. I recommend reading it; It’s not that long and I certainly learned a few things about the shape of the search and advertising business, and you probably would too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, a few members of my tribe were pushing back against this lawsuit. The first argument was “This is an operation of the corrupt and malevolent Trump administration, whose real target is their dorky notion that social media is biased against conservatives.” Well, no. Even granted the cosmic awfulness of the current administration, the complaint is still coherent and sensible, and none of the anticonservative-bias fantasyland makes an appearance. Sometimes bad organizations do good things; deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second pushback is along the lines of “It may be a monopoly but Google is a damn good search engine, and it’s free. So how can that be bad?” Which raises a very sensible question…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Who is harmed?&lt;/span&gt; · I agree: It’s not obvious that end-users are hurt directly. Google provides, at the end of the day, a pretty awesome search service. It meets my needs well, and they seem to fix &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/01/15/Google-is-losing-its-memory&quot;&gt;breakages&lt;/a&gt; when they’re reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is (to steal a phrase from the Complaint) “monopoly rents from advertisers”. Search advertising is a context where you know exactly what the user is looking for, and it’s amazingly effective, and Google enjoys a monopoly, which means they can charge what the market will bear, and they do. Here’s ¶168:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s exclusionary conduct also substantially forecloses competition in the search advertising and general search text advertising markets, harming advertisers. By suppressing competition, Google has more power to manipulate the quantity of ad inventory and auction dynamics in ways that allow it to charge advertisers more than it could in a competitive market. Google can also reduce the quality of the services it provides to advertisers, including by restricting the information it offers to advertisers about their marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Complaint doesn’t mention it, Google has used the insanely-effective AdTech machinery they’ve built around Search to go after the rest of the online advertising market. They and Facebook now enjoy an effective duopoly, which they’re using to ingest a larcenous proportion of the money flowing through the system, thereby wreaking devastation on the publishing industry. Which is to say, intellectually impoverishing our civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-1&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;The phone builders&lt;/span&gt; · The investigators did a really good job digging into the tools Google uses to wrangle the companies who make Android phones. There’s a carrot and a stick. The carrot is that if you play nice and give Google all the search business, they’ll pay a you a commission on the billions they get in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stick is the Google Android apps, in particular Google Play Services. Android may claim to be open-source but that’s smelling increasingly like a big fat lie, since apparently more and more essential features have migrated into Play Services, including notification capabilities and OAuth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually in the Android group when we shipped Play Services, and I thought it was a brilliant idea because we could add value to the platform without having to convince phonemakers to adopt a whole new release of Android, something they were famously bad at. I feel clueless for having missed the lock-in angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;The Apple Angle&lt;/span&gt; · The Complaint says that mobile traffic in the US is 60% iOS vs 40% Android, which I hadn’t known. Apple routes all the search traffic to Google, which in return routes billions of dollars to Apple. The arrangement works great for both of them. As for the advertisers and publications, they’re just roadkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-4&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Disappointment&lt;/span&gt; · Section VIII, at the end of the Complaint, is entitled “Request for Relief”. It doesn’t even fill one of the 64 pages. It asks the court to (a) agree that Google is behaving illegally, (b) “Enter structural relief as needed to cure any anticompetitive harm”, (c) force Google to stop doing these bad things, (d) do what it takes to restore competitive conditions, (e) do whatever else the Court finds just and proper, and (f) cover the plaintiffs’ expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m disappointed. Maybe this is a symptom of me not being an antitrust lawyer, but I’d have hoped for some specific, creative ideas on how to accomplish these good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the plaintiffs didn’t bother, let’s look at what they could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-7&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Regulation&lt;/span&gt; · If we don’t like what Google’s doing to the advertisers and the phone builders, we can pass new regulations to forbid them, or enter a Consent decree whereby Google agrees to stop doing those things. This is how the big Microsoft monopoly litigation was settled in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate it. You need to write these things carefully and the second the ink is dry the company will start working to game the system. Then there’s the risk of regulatory capture, where the people who are supposed to enforce the new rules start sharing Google’s worldview and basically just don’t. Finally, if new regulations apply to everyone not just Google (which they should) they can be turned into an advantage if they’re so cumbersome that only a giant company can afford to comply with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Breakup&lt;/span&gt; · One big problem with monopolies is that they use their locked-in profits to invade other business sectors and compete unfairly because they can afford to forego profit. The classic solution is just to break the monopolist the hell up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sympathetic to this approach and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google&quot;&gt;wrote a whole blog piece&lt;/a&gt; talking through this in detail. While I stand by every word, reading the Complaint raised my consciousness on the mobile front, which probably affects important details of the breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Utility-style regulation&lt;/span&gt; · So if you want to break the company up but you still want excellent search and you want to restore sanity to the advertising business, what else could you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a case that Web search is a natural monopoly. Running the crawlers and indexers and servers is freaking expensive, requiring monster capex and operational expenditure. It’s not obvious to me that the world needs more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter-argument would be that competition drives innovation. Speaking as a person who spent some years if his career working on full-text search, I doubt that there’s much left in the way of low-hanging fruit. But I might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about declaring that some parts of search implementation are monopolies, and that’s OK, and they should be regulated as such, in exactly the same way we regulate power and water and other natural-monopoly utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d require that the monopoly offer a straightforward full-text-based document retrieval API that implements several different ranking algorithms and bills per search. You’d forbid it from engaging in any advertising businesses. Then you’d free up people to build consumer-facing search interfaces and compete to sell advertising on them. They could also compete on enriched search, the kind of thing Google does where it converts units and currrencies, does arithmetic, knows timezones and populations and capital cities, and branches to the right Wikipedia article while you’re still typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could have one of these things that runs no advertising at all, just charges you a (pretty damn low) fee per search. On top of which it’d be faster. I could see myself paying for such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’d be tricky to work out. But it might give us a much, much nicer Internet. And a richer intellectual landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content-title&quot; readability=&quot;25.154228855721&quot;&gt;

On Wed 21 October 2020 with tags &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/tag/debconf20.html&quot;&gt;debconf20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/tag/donation.html&quot;&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/tag/fundraising.html&quot;&gt;fundraising&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/tag/peertube.html&quot;&gt;peertube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by &lt;strong&gt;Louis-Philippe Véronneau, Pouhiou, Laura Arjona Reina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/2020/10/debian-donation-peertube-fr.html&quot; hreflang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;fr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.debian.org/2020/10/debian-donation-peertube-pt-BR.html&quot; hreflang=&quot;pt-BR&quot;&gt;pt-BR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Debian project is happy to announce a donation of 10,000 € to help &lt;a href=&quot;https://framasoft.org&quot;&gt;Framasoft&lt;/a&gt; reach the fourth stretch-goal of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinpeertube.org/roadmap&quot;&gt;Peertube v3 crowdfunding campaign -- Live Streaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's iteration of the Debian annual conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://debconf20.debconf.org/&quot;&gt;DebConf20&lt;/a&gt;, had to be held online, and while being a resounding success, it made clear to the project our need to have a permanent live streaming infrastructure for small events held by local Debian groups. As such, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinpeertube.org/&quot;&gt;Peertube&lt;/a&gt;, a FLOSS video hosting platform, seems to be the perfect solution for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this unconventional gesture from the Debian project will help us make this year somewhat less terrible and give us, and thus humanity, better Free Software tooling to approach the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian thanks the commitment of numerous Debian donors and DebConf sponsors, particularly all those that contributed to DebConf20 online's success (volunteers, speakers and sponsors). Our project also thanks Framasoft and the PeerTube community for developing PeerTube as a free and decentralized video platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framasoft association warmly thanks the Debian Project for its contribution, from its own funds, towards making PeerTube happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contribution has a twofold impact. Firstly, it's a strong sign of recognition from an international project - one of the pillars of the Free Software world - towards a small French association which offers tools to liberate users from the clutches of the web's giant monopolies. Secondly, it's a substantial amount of help in these difficult times, supporting the development of a tool which equally belongs to and is useful to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of Debian's gesture proves, once again, that solidarity, mutual aid and collaboration are values which allow our communities to create tools to help us strive towards Utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
