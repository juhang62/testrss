<title>Uber Lays Off 400</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/technology/uber-job-cuts.html</link>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Uber said it laid off a third of its marketing team on Monday, or about 400 people, as the ride-hailing company tries to cut costs and streamline its operations after its initial public offering in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The cuts, which were also announced internally on Monday, are taking place in multiple Uber offices around the world, the company said. The marketing team had more than 1,200 people before the layoffs. Uber employs almost 25,000 people globally, nearly half of whom are based in the United States, according to recent regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Uber declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The layoffs are the latest shake-up at Uber since it went public two months ago. During its journey to the public markets, the company, which is unprofitable, faced numerous questions from Wall Street about whether it could make money. Ride-hailing is an expensive business, with providers often spending huge sums to recruit drivers and subsidize trips. Those doubts ultimately took a toll on Uber’s I.P.O., with the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/technology/uber-stock-price-ipo.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmike-isaac&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;company’s stock falling 7.6 percent&lt;/a&gt; on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since then, Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has moved to make changes at the company. In June, he &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/technology/uber-chief-operating-marketing-officer.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkate-conger&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;pushed out two members&lt;/a&gt; of his executive team: Barney Harford, the chief operating officer, and Rebecca Messina, the chief marketing officer. Ms. Messina’s role was eliminated, and the marketing team was reorganized under Uber’s communications lead, Jill Hazelbaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In addition, Uber’s board has been undergoing turnover. Ryan Graves, Uber’s first employee and a director, stepped down from the board in May. Last week, two more board members — Arianna Huffington, the founder of Thrive Global, and Matt Cohler, a venture capitalist at Benchmark — stepped down from their positions. Both Ms. Huffington and Mr. Cohler had been heavily involved in the departure of Mr. Khosrowshahi’s predecessor, Travis Kalanick, from Uber in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ariannahuff/status/1154142199946383360&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last week, Ms. Huffington said she had stepped down to focus on the growth of her own company. Mr. Cohler said in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he was “thrilled with the company’s position.” Uber has not announced their replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company faces another test on Aug. 8, when it is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings. When Uber reported its first-quarter results, it posted its slowest growth in years and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/technology/uber-stock-earnings.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkate-conger&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a loss of more than $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Wall Street analysts project that Uber will report a loss of $2.09 a share next week on revenue of $3.3 billion, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an email on Monday to Uber’s marketing staff, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Hazelbaker said the 400 layoffs were taking place because the team had grown bloated and decision-making was unclear. The marketing team’s organizational charts ran to more than 388 pages, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Hazelbaker added that she planned to consolidate Uber’s regional marketing teams around the world, including in the United States and Canada, Latin America and the Middle East. The marketing team oversees ride promotions, advertising campaigns and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These changes are incredibly difficult to make because they have a huge impact on people’s lives,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to Uber employees. “Many of our teams are too big, which creates overlapping work, makes for unclear decision owners and can lead to mediocre results. As a company, we can do more to keep the bar high, and expect more of ourselves and each other. So, put simply, we need to get our edge back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Browser extensions are underrated: the promise of hackable software</title>
<link>https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.geoffreylitt.com/images/article_images/legos.jpg?1564418366&quot; alt=&quot;Lego bricks&quot;/&gt; Photo by &lt;a class=&quot;figure-link&quot; href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/2FaCKyEEtis&quot;&gt;Rick Mason on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent conversations about web browser extensions have focused on controversy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/dataspii-inside-the-debacle-that-dished-private-data-from-apple-tesla-blue-origin-and-4m-people/&quot;&gt;malicious browser extensions capturing web history&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-ad-blockers-extensions-api/?verso=true&quot;&gt;Google limiting the capabilities used by ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;. These are important discussions, but we shouldn’t lose sight of the big picture: browser extensions are a special ecosystem worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among major software platforms today, &lt;strong&gt;browser extensions are the rare exception that allow and encourage users to modify the apps that we use&lt;/strong&gt;, in creative ways not intended by their original developers. On smartphone and desktop platforms, this sort of behavior ranges from unusual to impossible, but in the browser it’s an everyday activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser extensions remind us what it’s like to have deep control over how we use our computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assembling our own software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a software platform reaches a certain level of openness, it can fundamentally change the way that normal users relate to their software. By installing four different Gmail extensions that modify everything from the visual design to the core functionality, in some sense, I’ve put together my own email client. &lt;strong&gt;Instead of being a passive user of pre-built applications, I can start assembling my own personalized way of using my computer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popularity of browser extensions proves that many people are interested in customizing their software, and it’s not just a hobby for power users. There are over 180,000 extensions on the Chrome store, and nearly half of all Chrome users have browser extensions installed.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When people have an easy way to extend their software with useful functionality, they apparently take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hackable platforms, not custom APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser extensions have remarkably broad use cases. I personally use Chrome extensions that fill in my passwords, help me read Japanese kanji, simplify the visual design of Gmail, let me highlight and annotate articles, save articles for later reading, play videos at 2x speed, and of course, block ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key to this breadth is that most extensions modify applications in ways that the original developers didn’t specifically plan for.&lt;/strong&gt; When Japanese newspapers publish articles, they’re not thinking about compatibility with the kanji reading extension. Extension authors gain creative freedom because they don’t need to use application-specific APIs that reflect the original developers’ view of how people might want to extend their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web platform has a few qualities that enable this sort of unplanned extensibility. The foundational one is that the classic web deployment style is to ship all the client code to the browser in human-readable form. (Source maps are a key to preserving this advantage as we ship more code that’s minified or compiled from other languages.) The web’s layout model also promotes extensibility by encouraging standardized semantic markup—my password manager extension works because web pages reliably use form tags for password submissions instead of building their own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these advantages, it can still require clever tricks to modify a site in ways that it wasn’t built for. But it’s often a reasonable amount of work, not a years-long reverse engineering effort. The sheer variety of extensions available shows that extension authors are willing to jump through a few hoops to create useful software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there are tensions between website developers and extension authors, but it seems far more common that developers are fine with their sites being extended in creative ways, as long as they don’t have to do any extra work. Extensions can even make life easier for application developers: if there’s a niche request that a small minority of users want, a motivated community member can just build an extension to support it. By building on a hackable platform, developers allow their users to get even more value out of their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small tools, not big apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many browser extensions are generic tools designed to enhance my use of all websites. I can use my annotation extension on every website everywhere, instead of needing a different highlighting tool for each article I read. Just like using a physical highlighter with paper articles, I can master the tool once, and get a lot of leverage by applying it in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many software platforms, we think of the operating system as providing the cross-cutting tools, and third parties as providing standalone “apps” that are used in isolation. &lt;strong&gt;With browser extensions, third parties are also adding tools;&lt;/strong&gt; a single piece of software has the leverage to change my experience across all the apps I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When software is built in small units, it also changes the economics. Most extensions I use are free, and are perhaps too small in their feature set to support a full-blown business. And yet, people still choose to make them, and I benefit immensely from these little bits of software. Browsing the extension store feels more like going to a local flea market than going to a supermarket. Massive software built by huge companies isn’t the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The origins of openness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not an accident that this openness emerged on the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of personal computing, there’s been a philosophical tradition that encourages using computers as an interactive medium where people contribute their own ideas and build their own tools—authorship over consumption. This idea is reflected in systems like Smalltalk, Hypercard, and more recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynamicland.org/&quot;&gt;Dynamicland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, he imagined it fitting into this tradition. “My vision was a system in which sharing what you knew or thought should be as easy as learning what someone else knew.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There were some hiccups along the way&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2019/07/29/browser-extensions.html#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but eventually that vision largely won out, and the Web became a place where anyone can publish their opinions or photos through social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s a catch. When you’re using Facebook, you’re operating within a confined experience. You’re forced to publish in a certain format, and to use their app in a certain way (that includes, of course, seeing all the ads). There’s more room for authorship than just browsing a news website, but only within the strict lines the app has painted for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser extensions offer a deeper type of control.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of merely typing into the provided text box, we can color outside the lines and deeply modify the way we use any application on the web. Browser extensions offer a kind of decentralization: large companies building major websites don’t get to dictate all the details of our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving on extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clearly need to work on protecting people from malicious extensions that invade their privacy. But beyond that, here are some bigger picture opportunities I see for improving on extensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, it requires a big jump to go from using browser extensions to creating them: you need to learn a fair amount of web development to get started, and you can’t easily develop extensions in the browser itself. What if there were a quick way to get started developing and sharing extensions in the browser? You could imagine smoothly transitioning from editing a website in the developer tools to publishing a small extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Because extensions hook into websites in unsupported ways, updates to websites often result in extensions temporarily breaking, and extension authors scrambling to fix them. Can we make it easier for website developers and extension authors to form stable connections between their software, without necessarily resorting to using explicit extension APIs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are existing practices that fit into this category already—for example, using clean semantic markup, human-readable CSS, and source maps makes it easier to develop an extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple change that would allow for more stable extensions would be to give users more control over when they upgrade to new versions of cloud software. If I have a 3 month window to continue using an old version after the new one is released, that would give extension authors more time to upgrade their software for the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Web extensions are limited in their power by the typical architecture of web applications: they have broad rights to modify the browser client, but the server is off limits. For example, if my social media app’s server only provides an endpoint for querying my posts in chronological order, no browser extension can ever search through all my posts by keyword. How could we rethink the client-server boundary to enable extensions to make even deeper modifications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises tough questions around security and privacy. The modern browser extension API has done a good job balancing extensibility with security, and yet we’re still grappling with the consequences of browser extensions invading people’s privacy. Giving extensions more power would raise the stakes further. Still, we shouldn’t give up in the name of security—we should fight for extensibility as a value and find ways to balance these interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The next platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m intrigued by a couple projects that are rethinking the web in ways that might make it more extensible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://beakerbrowser.com/about/&quot;&gt;Beaker Browser&lt;/a&gt; and the decentralized web community are exploring how the web works without centralized servers. It seems like their proposed architecture would give users fuller control over modifying the “server” side of web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee is working on a new project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web&quot;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t yet understand precisely what they’re up to, but given Tim’s involvement I figure it’s worth paying attention. A key principle is giving users more ownership over their data, which would enable people to use extensions and other software to manipulate their data in flexible ways beyond what application server APIs allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing is still young, and platforms are changing quickly. Modern browser extensions and smartphone platforms have only been around for about a decade. These platforms will evolve, and there will be new platforms after them, and we will get to collectively decide how open they will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser extensions give us one example to strive for: a place where we routinely hack the software we use and make it our own. &lt;span&gt;▪&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;I am rather fond of the concepts described in &quot;Clean Code&quot; by Robert Martin but it seems that in real life, a really high-quality codebase is hard to come by.
&lt;p&gt;While I am asking myself this question, the only one that popups to my mind would be Laravel: https://github.com/laravel/laravel (PHP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could think that a codebase as popular as React (https://github.com/facebook/react) would be a perfect example of &quot;clean code&quot; but with a glance, I personally don't find it very expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may all be very subjective but I would love to see examples of codebases that member of this community have enjoyed working with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Why Lie Detector Tests Can’t Be Trusted</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Francis Gary Powers had his first polygraph experience right after signing up as a pilot for the CIA’s U-2 program in January 1956. In his memoir, Powers described being called into a room where he was confronted with the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any objection to taking a lie detector test?” Though I had a great many, I didn’t voice them, shaking my head. If this was a condition of the job, I’d do it. But I didn’t like it. … I had never felt so completely exposed, as if there was no privacy whatsoever. If at that moment someone had handed me a petition banning polygraphs forever from the face of the earth, I would gladly have signed it. When I was asked the last question and the straps were taken off, I vowed that never again, no matter what the circumstances, would I undergo such an insult to my integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Powers would later take another polygraph test, with even higher stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers’ case would be an uncommon one, but the polygraph was considered an essential tool in that period, for reasons that had little to do with getting to the truth. The polygraph was more of an attempted answer to a central Cold War conundrum: How could Americans fulfill their pledges to oppose an allegedly totalitarian enemy without becoming totalitarian themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To square this particular circle, federal agencies, first and foremost the CIA, began using a controversial technology developed by psychologists in the early 20th century, and then refined and applied by the police and private businesses since the 1920s. Polygraph measurements—derived from changes in blood pressure, breathing depth, and skin conductivity of an electric current—have never been proved to be reliable indicators of deception. Not only is genuine emotional turmoil hard to reproduce in laboratory studies, but such emotional responses are not uniform among humans and can be imitated by countermeasures (such as pinching yourself before giving a response). In large screening tests, significant numbers of “false positives” (innocent people being labeled deceptive) are unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the question of whether deception during a polygraph test indicates a person is unsuitable for employment transcends merely technical issues. In the final analysis, American security agencies never arrived at a definition of what personal characteristics a model employee should have. Instead, the polygraph provided reasons for dismissing a person as a security risk or denying him or her employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Leonarde Keeler polygraph patent.png&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/09z1sV4srt1xWRq32biLkghCgis=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/ec/d7/ecd7d263-224b-431a-aee3-de508b31af17/leonarde_keeler_polygraph_patent.png&quot;/&gt; Leonarde Keeler was the first American to receive a patent for a polygraph. His patent, granted on January 13, 1931, described the machine as an &quot;apparatus for recording arterial blood pressure.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2Y56zYY&quot;&gt;U.S. Patent 1,788,434&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bureaucratic usefulness, rather than any scientific validity, goes a long way toward explaining why the polygraph became a standard instrument of the American national security state. The case of Powers and his history with polygraphs is instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1956 to 1960, 24 U-2 flights over the USSR yielded invaluable strategic intelligence on Soviet military capabilities. But on May 1, 1960, disaster struck when Powers’ plane was shot down over Sverdlovsk (today called Yekaterinburg). American authorities issued a cover story about a weather balloon gone astray and were caught flat-footed when Nikita Khrushchev presented to the world the remnants of the plane, and then the pilot himself. Powers had miraculously survived and was subsequently put on trial in Moscow and sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage. In February 1962, he was exchanged for Soviet KGB colonel Vilyam Fisher (alias Rudolf Ivanovich Abel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers returned home a hero under suspicion. Unbeknownst to him and the American public, doubts about his truthfulness arose due to National Security Agency intercepts of Soviet responses to the U-2 flights. Tracked radar signals indicated that Powers’ plane had dropped below its regular altitude of 65,000 feet, making it vulnerable to surface-to-air missile attacks. But Powers vehemently denied that he had allowed the plane to decline. The CIA, fearing for its then-stellar reputation with the American public, insisted on Powers’ innocence as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIA director John McCone set up a board of inquiry under a federal judge, E. Barrett Prettyman, to prepare a statement for public consumption. The document highlighted that medical tests, a background check, and an interrogation had confirmed that Powers “appeared to be truthful, frank, straightforward. … He volunteered with some vehemence that, although he disliked the process of the polygraph, he would like to undergo a polygraph test. That test was subsequently duly administered by an expert. … [Powers] displayed no indications of deviation from the truth in the course of the examination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with Powers’ own version of his treatment: Getting frustrated by “doubts about my responses, … I finally reacted angrily, bellowing: ‘If you don’t believe me, I’ll be glad to take a lie detector test!’ … Even before the words were out of my mouth, I regretted saying them. ‘Would you be willing to take a lie detector test on everything you have testified here?’ … I knew that I had been trapped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Francis Gary Powers.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/eqnRf64FHe_A21wUWrwlkpnLRwA=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/4d/c8/4dc8855d-9bf5-4805-8d92-fc3a5b1a06b0/francis_gary_powers.jpg&quot;/&gt; Francis Gary Powers holds a model of a U-2 spy plane as he testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Powers' plane was shot down by the Soviets, and he was tried and convicted of spying in the USSR. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Bettmann/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since shortly after its creation in 1947, the CIA has used the polygraph as part of its personnel security procedures to ascertain the truthfulness of job applicants and employees and to confirm the bona fides of agents. At the height of McCarthyism, utilizing a machine known by the public as a “lie detector” made sense, especially for a brand-new agency that had to be staffed quickly. To its proponents, the polygraph represented a promise of objectivity and fairness along with effective deterrence of spies and traitors. As a CIA inspector general report from 1963 emphasized, “We do not and could not aspire to total security. Our open society has an inherent resistance to police-state measures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When challenged by Congress, which investigated federal polygraph use repeatedly beginning in the mid-1960s, the CIA defended the polygraph aggressively. In 1980, the Director of Central Intelligence’s Security Committee insisted: “The utility of the polygraph interview as part of security processing has been demonstrated by empirical means. … These practical results, plus more than thirty years’ experience, make the use of the polygraph in security screening truly unique and indispensable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet internally, CIA bureaucrats admitted that the practice of sorting out job applicants and employees based on their test results was questionable at best. Even after decades of polygraph practice, the CIA could not define what exactly it meant by elusive terms such as “routine” and “voluntary” in its polygraph program. A 1974 list of questions from polygraph examiners to the general counsel included the following query: “What can a polygraph officer say in response to the question: ‘Do I have to take this test to get a job with the Agency?’ or ‘What happens if I don’t take the test?’” The relevance of the evidence produced during most polygraph tests was also unclear. “The precise yardstick for the measuring of security reliability of an individual continued to be elusive,” an internal CIA history on personnel security concluded in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until his death in a helicopter accident in 1977, Powers insisted that he had acted as a loyal American under trying circumstances. No definite account of the incident has been established yet. We also don’t know what data Powers’ polygraph test produced. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the Kennedy administration found it advisable to assure the public of Powers’ truthfulness, and that announcing that Powers had passed a polygraph test was part of their public relations strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers’ experience highlights three ambiguous characteristics of polygraph use by the CIA for purposes of “national security.” First, the claim by polygraph proponents that the test could be a witness for the defense, exonerating loyal citizens, often turned out to be less than clear-cut. Second, while the polygraph relied on the rhetoric of voluntarism, in reality the pressure to take the test often mocked the idea of a free decision. Third, polygraph exams often served to provide official cover rather than revealing the truth of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other questions haunted the polygraph throughout the Cold War, and the often-traumatic experience of the test provoked fierce protests from Americans across ideological lines. Journalists Joseph and Stewart Alsop, two otherwise unrelenting Cold War boosters, compared the polygraph to the embrace of an octopus whose “electric tentacles” produced an “overwhelming impulse to tell all … in order to appease the octopus machine.” Even former chief of CIA counterintelligence James Olson called polygraph exams “an awful but necessary ordeal. We all hate them. … A polygraph examination … is rude, intrusive, and sometimes humiliating. … It’s a grueling process.” Whether the sheer unpleasantness of the exam did more to deter potential traitors, or kept otherwise upstanding citizens from joining the agency, is impossible to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there is the question of whether the polygraph ever caught Soviet spies. Certainly no major communist spy was ever caught by the machine, and the most damaging one, Aldrich Ames, passed two routine polygraph exams after he had delivered deadly information about U.S. activities in the Soviet Union to his handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Ames case almost fatally damaged the polygraph’s reputation, the technology was rekindled in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, because, once again, it gave the appearance of a scientific way to test such elusive values as loyalty when doing the inherently risky jobs of screening employees and counterintelligence work. As the history of the polygraph makes clear, American policy makers place great trust in technological fixes to thorny political problems—even though they themselves question those fixes privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Baesler is a professor of history at Saginaw Valley State University and the author of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/umpress/title/clearer-truth&quot;&gt;Clearer Than Truth: The Polygraph and the American Cold War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    India is now estimated to be home to 70% of the world's tigers
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;India is now home to nearly 3,000 tigers, a third more than it had four years ago, according to the latest tiger census.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who presented the findings on Monday, said the tiger population had risen from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,967 in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that India is &quot;now one of the biggest and most secure habitats of the tiger&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is now estimated to be home to around 70% of the world's tigers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India counts its tigers once every four years - it's a long, arduous task that involves forest officials and scientists trekking across half a million square kilometres (193,000 sq miles) looking for evidence of the tiger population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Modi said the results of this tiger census would make &quot;every Indian happy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a major conservation success, correspondents say. By one estimate, between 1875 and 1925 alone, some 80,000 tigers were killed in India. Bounty and sports hunting were rampant - kings and officials killed tigers in their thousands, using guns, spears, nets, traps and poison. By the 1960s the number of tigers had dwindled precipitously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a number of government initiatives to streamline tiger conservation  - including a ban on hunting and awareness drives in villages -are said to be behind the increase of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strict wildlife protection law implemented in 1972 made it virtually illegal to kill or capture wild animals even when &quot;problem animals&quot; were involved in severe conflict situations. Under pressure from global conservationists, India also upped investments to hire more forest guards and improve protection of reserves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    India has seen an uptick in tiger numbers since 2006
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results began to show in 2006, and since then there has been a healthy uptick in tiger numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there has also been an increase in human-tiger conflict recently and one reason is that India has too many tigers and too few forests that can sustain them unless more protected reserves are added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45819780&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer'?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one estimate, big cats breed and live in only about 10% of India's total potential tiger habitat of 300,000 sq km (115,830 sq miles). Animal density in many of these forest areas is high, and surplus tigers sometimes venture outside for food, bringing them into conflict with people who live nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservationists say conflict with humans is largely restricted to the edges of protected areas, forests and plantations - and that unless India expands tiger reserves, such conflicts will increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Report on Microsoft Office and Windows software: still privacy risks remaining</title>
<link>https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/new-dpia-on-microsoft-office-and-windows-software-still-privacy-risks-remaining-short-blog/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/new-dpia-on-microsoft-office-and-windows-software-still-privacy-risks-remaining-short-blog/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On behalf of the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security, Privacy Company has investigated the privacy risks related to the use of Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise, Office 365 ProPlus and Office Online, as well as the mobile Office apps. With the Ministry’s permission, we are publishing two blog posts about our findings: this short blog post as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/new-dpia-on-microsoft-office-and-windows-software-still-privacy-risks-remaining-long-blog/&quot;&gt;long blog post&lt;/a&gt;. For questions about the research, please contact SLM Rijk (Strategisch Leveranciersmanagement Microsoft Rijk), which can be contacted via the Ministry of Justice’s press spokesperson, +31 (0)70 370 73 45.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New privacy terms and conditions for the Dutch central government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of May 2019, SLM Rijk and Microsoft concluded negotiations about new privacy terms and conditions for the 300,000 digital workplaces of the central Dutch government. These are the corporate versions of the Office and Windows 10 software, which are used by the ministries, the Tax and Customs Administration, the police, the judiciary, and independent administrative bodies. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2019/06/11/data-protection-impact-assessment-windows-10-enterprise&quot;&gt;Three new DPIAs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (Data Protection Impact Assessments, written in English), which Privacy Company has carried out for the central government, show that Microsoft has solved the eight previously identified privacy risks for Office 365 ProPlus through a combination of technical, organisational, and contractual measures. See &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise/&quot;&gt;the previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; about these risks. In a recent &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/brieven_regering/detail?id=2019Z13829&amp;amp;did=2019D28465&quot;&gt;letter to the Dutch House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, the results of the negotiations that SLM Rijk has conducted with Microsoft are listed: Microsoft only acts as a data processor for all its online services, processes the personal data for only three purposes, does not process the usage data for profiling, data analytics, market research or advertisements, and grants effective audit rights to the central Dutch government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measures taken in Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Microsoft has globally implemented a large number of technical and organisational measures to reduce the privacy risks identified for Office 365 ProPlus. Since May 2019, Microsoft has been publishing &lt;u&gt;extensive documentation&lt;/u&gt; on the diagnostic data relating to the use of Office ProPlus. Microsoft has &lt;u&gt;adapted&lt;/u&gt; its existing &lt;u&gt;Data Viewer Tool&lt;/u&gt; for Windows 10 to also display the Office 365 ProPlus telemetry data. This allows data subjects to view the Office ProPlus data that Microsoft collects from their device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since May 2019, Microsoft has been offering a large number of frequently used Connected Experiences such as the spelling checker, the translation module, and the Office help function as a processor, and no longer as a data controller. There are 14 Connected Experiences for which Microsoft remains the controller (the additional Connected Experiences), but Microsoft enables system administrators of Office ProPlus to &lt;u&gt;centrally disable the use of these Controller Connected Experiences&lt;/u&gt;. Centrally disabling these services avoids the risk of Microsoft asking the employees for consent to collect data about the use of these services, while consent is not a valid legal basis for this data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of the Office 365 ProPlus version 1904, as made available by Microsoft on 29 April 2019, Microsoft has also built in a &lt;u&gt;choice&lt;/u&gt; for system administrators &lt;u&gt;to minimize the telemetry level&lt;/u&gt;. Microsoft offers three options: Required, Optional, and Neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No improvements for Windows 10 Enterprise, Office Online and the mobile apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not yet implemented these improvements in Office Online and the mobile Office apps. The Dutch government’s new privacy terms and conditions do not (yet) apply to data processing via Windows 10 Enterprise or the mobile Office apps. It is not possible to minimize data traffic in Office Online. From at least three of the mobile apps on iOS, data about the use of the apps goes to a US-American marketing company that specializes in predictive profiling. This is done without providing any information about the purposes of this processing, and without giving the users or administrators any possibility to prevent this processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLM Rijk therefore advises government agencies to, for the time being, refrain from using Office Online and the mobile Office apps and to opt for the lowest possible level of data collection in Windows 10, called &lt;em&gt;Security.&lt;/em&gt; If the government institutions’ system administrators also follow the other recommendations from the DPIA reports, there will no longer be any known high privacy risks for the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the government will continue to negotiate with Microsoft in order to bring Windows 10 Enterprise and the mobile apps within the scope of the new privacy terms, and to implement the same technical improvements for Office Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can organisations do that are not part of the central Dutch government?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies and organisations outside the central Dutch government must take high privacy risks into account when using Office 365 ProPlus, Office Online, the mobile Office apps, and Windows 10 Enterprise. They can take a number of mitigating measures themselves, but in order to really remove the high risks, they should turn to Microsoft – preferably via a professional association – in order to negotiate privacy guarantees similar to those of the national Dutch government. It would do no harm to refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2019/edps-investigates-contractual-agreements_en&quot;&gt;the European Data Protection Superviser’s ongoing investigation of the contract terms&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft offers to European institutions. Apart from that, organisations could also carry out their own DPIA, based on the reports from the government, and submit the residual risks to the Data Protection Authority, as referred to in Article 36 of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures that can be taken by the organisations themselves include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Upgrade to version 1905 or higher of Office 365 ProPlus and set the telemetry level to the 'Neither' option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Make use of the possibility to prohibit the use of the Controller Connected Experiences in Office 365 ProPlus (disable additional Connected Experiences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Disable the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) in Office ProPlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Disable LinkedIn integration for Microsoft employee accounts in Office ProPlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Establish policies to warn employees not to use the mobile Office apps and the Controller Connected Experiences in Office Online until the remaining five high risks have been mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Choose the lowest, minimum level of diagnostic data collection in Office Online and the mobile apps as soon as technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Update the internal privacy policy for handling employee personal data with specific information about for which purposes and under which circumstances the organisation may view different types of diagnostic data from Microsoft's different services and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Perform DPIAs prior to using Workplace Analytics and Activity Reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center and before employees can use MyAnalytics and Delve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;     Consider the use of Customer Lockbox and Customer Key, depending on the sensitivity of the content data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Upgrade to version 1903 of Windows 10 Enterprise to use Intune with &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt;telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Set the telemetry level in Windows 10 Enterprise to &lt;em&gt;Security&lt;/em&gt;, or block telemetry traffic and do not allow users to synchronize their activities via the Timeline functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;·&lt;/strong&gt;      Take into account changes in the validity of data transfer tools (such as the EC Standard Contractual Clauses) following future case law of the European Court of Justice. It is up to the European Court of Justice to assess the risks of mass surveillance in the United States and up to the European legislator to reduce the remaining risks of transmitting diagnostic data from the EU to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The how and why of these recommendations is explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2019/06/11/data-protection-impact-assessment-windows-10-enterprise&quot;&gt;three separate DPIAs&lt;/a&gt; for SLM Rijk.

<title>YouTube faces creator backlash</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/youtube-faces-creator-backlash-30b7e425-ec93-4f02-aec3-6f418e009b56.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/youtube-faces-creator-backlash-30b7e425-ec93-4f02-aec3-6f418e009b56.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;YouTube, the Google-owned video platform that gave rise to dozens of famous video stars, is now facing pushback from the very community that it has worked to build over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube's creator backlash is occurring as other user-generated video platforms begin to emerge as creators' favorites — most notably, Chinese-owned karaoke-style video app TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;hidden-30b7e425-ec93-4f02-aec3-6f418e009b56&quot; class=&quot;&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtubersunion.org/&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;YouTubers Union&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; a self-proclaimed movement that &quot;fights for the rights of YouTube creators and users,&quot; is teaming up with Germany's largest union (and Europe's largest industrial union) to launch a joint campaign targeting YouTube, Vice News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5wy8d/the-youtubers-union-is-not-messing-around&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;The campaign, called &quot;FairTube,&quot; seeks to hold YouTube accountable for the changes the platform has made to video monetization and distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;The campaign says on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://fairtube.info/en/&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that it asked YouTube to enter into negotiations with it on July 26, and it has given YouTube an apparent negotiation deadline of Aug. 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; The news comes amid reports that creators ditched YouTube at this year's annual VidCon video creator conference for YouTube's new video rival, TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/vidcon-influencers-youtube-tiktok?utm_campaign=meetedgar&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=meetedgar.com&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/a&gt;, creators complained about YouTube’s lack of institutional support, while marketers and brand managers &quot;seemed excited about what a YouTube-less future might look like.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube has defended policies that it thought would benefit creators in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Earlier this month, the company made changes to the way creators can file copyright claims to make them easer to manage, The Verge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687985/youtube-manual-copyright-claim-updates-timestamps-automatic-release&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, YouTube led an aggressive consumer-facing lobbying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/youtube-vs-eu-free-speech-battleground-64781f05-5019-478c-83ec-8bc0eb6137e7.html&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to fight the European Union's new Copyright Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Ahead of VidCon, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690295/youtube-vidcon-2019-monetization-features-super-stickers&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;added more ways&lt;/a&gt; for video creators to make money, while many of its competitors, including Facebook and Snapchat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/facebooks-war-to-win-over-creators-acf6d0c9-223d-4f7f-9def-c029240a74c1.html&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;also introduced&lt;/a&gt; new tools for creators to make more money and gain more traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube is still one of the largest and most lucrative ad platforms in the world, and many creators earn a lot more money there than on some of the smaller or newer video platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;According to a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewinternet.org/2019/07/25/popular-youtube-channels-produced-a-vast-amount-of-content-much-of-it-in-languages-other-than-english/&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Pew Research Center, a little over 40,000 high-subscriber YouTube channels produced nearly a quarter-million videos on YouTube in just the first week of 2019. Together, their videos were viewed more than 14.2 billion times in their first 7 days on the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;While YouTube's parent Google doesn't specify how much revenue YouTube makes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/youtube-financial-disclosure-google.html&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; put its annual revenue at anywhere between $16 billion to $25 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Some creators may be unhappy with the way YouTube sets and changes policies on its platform, but this new backlash isn't likely to slow the video giant's overall momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
