<title>Email is your electronic memory</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;blog-author&quot;&gt;Bron Gondwana – 14 February 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CEO’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you write planned blog posts, sometimes events in the news are a prompt to re-examine your values. This is one of those second times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gmail and AMP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Google announced that Gmail will use AMP to make emails dynamic, up-to-date and actionable. At first that sounds like a great idea. Last week’s news is stale. Last week’s special offer from your favourite shop might not be on sale any more. The email is worthless to you now. Imagine if it could stay up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/google-wants-to-use-amp-to-make-email-more-interactive/&quot;&gt;wrote about AMP in Gmail&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/author/devin-coldewey/&quot;&gt;one of their columnists&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/&quot;&gt;followup&lt;/a&gt; response about why it might not be a good idea – which led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16372234&quot;&gt;lot of discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devin used the word static. In the past I have used the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fastmail.com/2014/12/05/security-integrity/&quot;&gt;immutable&lt;/a&gt;. I think “immutable” is more precise, though maybe less plain and simple language than “static” – because I don’t really care about how dynamic and interactive email becomes – usability is great, I’m all in favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unchanging-ness... that’s really important. In fact, it’s the key thing about email. It is the biggest thing that email has over social networking or any of the hosted chat systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email which is just a wrapper for content pulled from a website is no longer an unchangeable copy of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be totally honest, email already has a problem with mutability – an email which is just a wrapper around &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=email+remote+images&quot;&gt;remotely hosted images&lt;/a&gt; can already be created, though FastMail offers you the option of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html&quot;&gt;turning them off or restricting them to senders in your address book&lt;/a&gt;. Most sites and email clients offer an option to block remote images by default, both for privacy and because they can change after being delivered (even more specifically, an email with remote images can totally change after being content scanned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your own memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email in your mailbox is &lt;strong&gt;your copy&lt;/strong&gt; of what was said, and nobody else can change it or make it go away. The fact that the content of an email can’t be edited is one of the best things about POP3 and IMAP email standards. I admit it annoyed me when I first ran into it – why can’t you just fix up a message in place – but the immutability is the real strength of email. You can safely forget the detail of something that you read in an email, knowing that when you go back to look at it, the information will be exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time your mailbox becomes an extension of your memory – a trusted repository of history, in the way that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/new-york-times-bernie-sanders-coverage-public-editor/&quot;&gt;online news site will never be&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of the underlying reasons, it is a fact that websites can be “corrected” after you read them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politwoops.com/g/australia&quot;&gt;tweets can be deleted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34872506/facebook-censorship-had-a-post-removed-and-dont-know-why&quot;&gt;posts taken down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, often things are taken down or edited for good reasons. The problem is, you can read something online, forward somebody a link to it or just go back later to re-read it, and discover that the content has changed since you were last there. If you don’t have perfect memory (I sure don’t!) then you may not even be sure exactly what changed – just be left with a feeling that it’s not quite how you remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, email is not like that. Email is static, immutable, unchanging. That’s really important to me, and really important to FastMail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fastmail.com/2016/12/13/fastmails-values/&quot;&gt;Our values&lt;/a&gt; are very clear – your data belongs to you, and we promise to be good stewards of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to promise that FastMail will “never implement AMP” because compatibility is also important to our users, but we will proceed cautiously and skeptically on any changes that allow emails to mutate after you’ve seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An online datastore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’re a hosted “cloud” service. If we turned bad, we could start silently changing your email. The best defence against any cloud service doing that is keeping your own copies, or at least digests of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from trusting us, and our multiple replicas and backups of every email, we make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/account/downloaddata.html&quot;&gt;very easy&lt;/a&gt; to keep your own copies of messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;6.2385057471264&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.95833333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full standards-compliant access to email. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/#clients&quot;&gt;IMAP or POP3&lt;/a&gt; to download messages. IMAP provides the triple of “foldername / uidvalidity / uid” as a unique key for every message. Likewise we provide CalDAV and CardDAV access to the raw copies of all your calendars and contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.7799352750809&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export in useful formats. Multiple formats for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/contacts/importexportcontacts.html#exportcontacts&quot;&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt;. Standard ICS files for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/calendar/importexportcalendars.html#exportcalendars&quot;&gt;calendars&lt;/a&gt; and it’s rather hidden, but at the bottom of the Folders screen, there’s a link called “Mass delete or remove duplicates” and there’s a facility on that screen to download entire folders as a zip file as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working towards new standards for email. Our team is working hard on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmap.io/&quot;&gt;JMAP&lt;/a&gt; and will be participating in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/101hackathon&quot;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt; at IETF in London in March to test interoperability with other implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide a DIGEST.SHA1 non-standard fetch item via IMAP that allows you to fetch the SHA1 of any individual email. It’s not a standard though. We plan to offer something similar via JMAP, but for any attachment or sub-part of emails as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your data, your choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe that our customers stay with us because we’re the best, not because it’s hard to leave. If for any reason you want to leave FastMail, we make it as easy as possible to migrate your email away. Because it’s all about trust – trust that we will keep your email confidential, trust that we will make your email easy to access, and trust that every email will be exactly the same, every time you come back to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our customers for choosing us, and staying with us. If you’re not our customer yet, please do grab yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/signup/&quot;&gt;free trial account&lt;/a&gt; and check out our product. Let us know via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/support/&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/FastMail&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, whether you decide to stay, and particuarly if you decide not to! The only thing we don’t want to hear is “it should be free” – we’re not interested in that discussion, we provide a good service and we proudly charge for it so that you are our customer, not our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not ready to move all your email, you can get a lot of the same features for a whole group of people using &lt;a href=&quot;https://topicbox.com/&quot;&gt;Topicbox&lt;/a&gt; – a shared memory without having to change anything except the “To:” line in the emails you send!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/category/facebook/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is feeling lonely these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media behemoth has seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/31/facebook-earnings-2017-50-million-hours-per-day-traffic/&quot;&gt;a decline in traffic&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks along with millions of users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/2/12/16998750/facebooks-teen-users-decline-instagram-snap-emarketer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaving its platform&lt;/a&gt;, and it appears to be taking rather drastic measures to win them back. Specifically, spamming the hell out of them in a most unfortunate place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So says one account holder, Gabriel Lewis, who tweeted that Facebook texted &quot;spam&quot; to the phone number he submitted for the purposes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2016/09/22/two-factor-authentication-hackers/&quot;&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;. And no, he insists &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gabriel__Lewis/status/963795048247644160&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he did not&lt;/a&gt; have mobile notifications turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, when he replied &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;DO NOT TEXT ME,&quot; he says those message showed up on his Facebook wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twitter-wrapper sort-rerender&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.5959183673469&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7.4204081632653&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So I signed up for 2 factor auth on Facebook and they used it as an opportunity to spam me notifications. Then they posted my replies on my wall. 🤦‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Fy44b07wNg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fy44b07wNg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Gabriel Lewis 🦆 (@Gabriel__Lewis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Gabriel__Lewis/status/963121814166630400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis explained his version of the story to Mashable via Twitter direct message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Recently] I decided to sign up for 2FA on all of my accounts including FaceBook, shortly afterwards they started sending me notifications from the same phone number. I never signed up for it and I don't even have the FB app on my phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis further explained that he can go &quot;for months&quot; without signing into Facebook, which suggests the possibility that Mark Zuckerberg's creation was feeling a little neglected and trying to get him back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lewis, he signed up for 2FA on Dec. 17 and the alleged spamming began on Jan. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; data-credit-name=&quot;Gabriel Lewis&quot; data-credit-provider=&quot;custom type&quot; data-caption=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; title=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iRUEnTo68zT4JTuwH6fwGIJy57U=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F714825%2F0a873b48-bf93-475e-a72b-49d9355b8520.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screengrab showing when Lewis first signed up for 2FA on Facebook, and the beginning of the alleged spam.&quot; data-fragment=&quot;m!0ee3&quot; data-image=&quot;https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XNC9-wx7fGAvYqsxtM37rpZX9IQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F714825%2F0a873b48-bf93-475e-a72b-49d9355b8520.jpg&quot; data-micro=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-credit&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Gabriel Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Facebook to find out just what, exactly, is going on here. Is this some kind of bug? Perhaps a limited test? It's not really clear, as the comment offered from a company spokesperson didn't shed much light on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We give people control over their notifications, including those that relate to security features like two-factor authentication,&quot; noted the spokesperson. &quot;We’re looking into this situation to see if there’s more we can do to help people manage their communications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Lewis isn't the only person who claims this happened to him. One Facebook user says he accidentally told &quot;friends and family to go [to] hell&quot; when he &quot;replied to the spam.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twitter-wrapper sort-rerender&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7.1282051282051&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;8.0192307692308&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Same thing happened to me. I inadvertently told my friends and family to go hell when I replied to the spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— David Comdico (@dcomdico) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dcomdico/status/963834878038106112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 14, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't look good for for Facebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/11/03/zeynep-tufekci-facebook-social-media/&quot;&gt;Zeynep Tufekci&lt;/a&gt;, a self-described technosociologist, professor at UNC, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/10/27/facebook-ads-algorithm-problem/&quot;&gt;frequent Facebook critic&lt;/a&gt;, voiced some particularly strong concerns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as Lewis is concerned, Facebook attempts to woo him back have more or less backfired. &quot;I feel like they are constantly pushing me to come back to the service but this is not the way to do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, no one likes a desperate ex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include a statement from a Facebook spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have issued a stern warning to Americans: Do not buy smartphones made by Chinese tech companies Huawei or ZTE.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Top officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Defense Intelligence Agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?440888-1/fbi-director-rob-porter-background-check-completed-july&amp;amp;start=7106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that the Chinese smartphone makers posed a security threat to American customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked the group to raise their hands if they would recommend private American citizens use products or services made by Apple competitor Huawei or smartphone maker ZTE. None of them did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBI Director Chris Wray explained why it is an issue for companies and local governments to use Huawei or ZTE products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of letting any company &quot;beholden to foreign governments&quot; inside the country's telecommunications infrastructure, he said. Huawei is a global leader in networking equipment, and the government has previously blocked it from selling technology to some federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/technology/huawei-att-smartphone-talks-collapse/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inStoryHeading&quot;&gt;Related: Huawei fails to clinch smartphone deal with AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information,&quot; Wray said. &quot;And it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei has not made strides in the U.S. market in large part because of government concerns that the Chinese government can use its smartphones and other products for intelligence gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Congress released &lt;a href=&quot;http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/congressional-report-u-s-should-view-with-suspicion-two-chinese-companies/?iid=EL&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; saying the two Chinese companies should be viewed &quot;with suspicion.&quot; The companies both &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/08/technology/huawei-zte-congress/index.html&quot;&gt;strongly disputed&lt;/a&gt; the reports' findings at the time, with Huawei calling them &quot;baseless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, talks between Huawei and AT&amp;amp;T to sell its smartphones &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/09/technology/huawei-att-smartphone-talks-collapse/index.html&quot;&gt;fell through&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Wray praised the efforts of telecommunications providers that are trying to &quot;raise awareness on this issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei said in a statement Wednesday that it is &quot;monitoring developments&quot; in Congress, but it declined to comment directly on the intelligence committee hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company highlighted its strong position in many markets outside of the U.S. Its phones outsell Apple's in places like Central and Eastern Europe, according to research firm Canalys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We operate in 170 countries where there is trust with governments and customers. We pose no greater cybersecurity risk than other vendors,&quot; Huawei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company insisted it &quot;has never been asked to provide access to our technology, or provide any data or information on any citizen or organization to any government, or their agencies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/technology/zte-china-iran-sanctions/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inStoryHeading&quot;&gt;Related: ZTE fined $1.2 billion for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE said in a statement that its mobile phones and devices incorporate chipsets and other components manufactured in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards,&quot; a representative for ZTE said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;amp;id=887&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a bill last week that would prohibit the government from contracting with companies that use Huawei or ZTE products. It's a companion bill to the &quot;Defending U.S. Government Communications Act&quot; put forth in the House last month. In 2013, Congress passed a law that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-espionage/u-s-law-to-restrict-government-purchases-of-chinese-it-equipment-idUSBRE92Q18O20130327&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; some federal agencies from buying tech from these firms without approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the latest push by Congress to prohibit foreign-made products due to intelligence concerns. For instance, the Russia-based Kaspersky Lab has been banned from federal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Launch HN: SheerlyGenius (YC W18) – Indestructible Tights from Bulletproof Fiber</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16377751</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16377751</guid>
<description>I’m Katherine Homuth and I founded Sheerly Genius - indestructible sheer tights made from bulletproof fibers. We just launched our product on Kickstarter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2e.go2.fund/tights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.2e.go2.fund/tights&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;p&gt;Every year $8 billion dollars worth of sheer tights/pantyhose end up in the landfill after only one or two wears. Ripping sheers is as easy as accidentally catching them on a fingernail, or simply pulling too hard while putting them on. Our goal is to replace these disposable products with Sheerly Genius, which has been tested to last up to 50 wears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been working on this for about 12 months so far and it has been quite an adventure. When I started out I didn’t think we’d be developing our own fiber and machines, but that’s what it ultimately took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first fibers I looked at were aramids, like kevlar, which of course were attractive for their strength. To be considered sheer (as opposed to opaque), a pair of tights needs fibers that are 30 denier or less. Denier measures the thickness or fineness of a fiber. I quickly learned that the lowest denier kevlar came in was 1000 denier! So it was a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that none of the fibers on the market today were both fine and strong enough to make an indestructible sheer product. Ultimately we had to develop our own fiber: a finer, colored version of the non-dyeable polyethylene fibers used in higher end bulletproof vests and climbing equipment. To use these fibers we had to retrofit circular knitting machines with new feeding systems and blades, because the fibers are so strong they break typical knitting machines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is in software and manufacturing - building and selling two companies prior to Sheerly Genius. But this is my first journey into textiles. In my last startup I worked directly with many hardware companies, but became increasingly skeptical of the trend in IoT towards “connected” anything. One thing I love about this project is that we’ve been able to innovate in wearables without being connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: Half of our backers on Kickstarter so far have been men!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to talking manufacturing, textiles, and crowdfunding. Can’t wait to hear your ideas and experiences in these areas. Also happy to answer any questions about our journey in developing the product so far!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CSS Grid for UI Layouts</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/css-grid-for-ui-layouts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/css-grid-for-ui-layouts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid is a great layout tool for content-driven websites that include long passages of text, and it has tremendous value for a variety of traditional UI layouts as well. In this article I’ll show you how to use CSS Grid to improve application layouts that need to respond and adapt to user interactions and changing conditions, and always have your panels scroll properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; builds website layouts. It lets web designers create beautiful dynamic layouts using just a tiny bit of supported code instead of the endless float hacks we’ve had to use for years. My friend and co-worker Jen Simmons has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://jensimmons.com/writing&quot;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; CSS Grid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRYrbcGWjzU&quot;&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, tirelessly pushing to get it implemented in browsers, and her work has paid off. As of the end of last year, the current version of &lt;em&gt;every major browser, desktop and mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;supports CSS Grid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid really is powerful, and you can build dynamic content driven websites easily, like in &lt;a href=&quot;https://speckyboy.com/creative-examples-css-grid-layouts/&quot;&gt;these examples&lt;/a&gt;. However, Grid is good for more than laying out pretty blocks of content. Grid gives you full control over both dimensions of your layout, including scrolling. This means features we take for granted in native applications like collapsing side-panels and fixed toolbars are now trivial to implement. No more hacks and no more debugging. Grid just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been building web tools for years. Here’s a screenshot of a game building tool I made for my retro RPGs. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flexbox&lt;/a&gt; first appeared I immediately started using it. I built complex layouts using nested horizontal and vertical boxes, with a few utility classes for things like scrolling and stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31917 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image4-500x309.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;309&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-500x309.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-250x155.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4-768x475.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image4.png 982w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexbox has certainly made me more productive than absolutely positioned divs and float hacks, but it still has problems. Look at this closeup where panels come together. See how the footers on the left and right don’t line up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31918 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;84&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image5.png 348w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image5-250x60.png 250w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another screenshot. The toolbar is at the top of the drawing canvas, and according to my framework it should be fixed at the top, but the minute you start scrolling this happens. The toolbar disappears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31919 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image3-500x458.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-500x458.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-250x229.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3-768x703.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image3.png 1476w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these problems can be fixed with more positioning and float hacks, but the result is always fragile. Every time I add a new panel I have to debug my layout all over again; searching to identify which &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; is grabbing the extra space during a resize. And the markup is ugly. The nested horizontal and vertical boxes become very complicated, and this example is only two levels deep. As interaction and functionality become more complex the design becomes even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class='vbox'&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='scroll'&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class='sidebar'&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='footer'&amp;gt;footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class=vbox&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;button button 
        spacer label spacer button button &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='center'&amp;gt;main content&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class='hbox'&amp;gt;the footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;div class=vbox&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’hbox’&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’scroll’&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class=’sidebar’&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=’footer’&amp;gt;footer&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Entering the Second Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem with Flexbox is that it is one dimensional. This makes Flexbox great for one dimensional uses, like toolbars and navbars, but it begins to fail when I need to align content both horizontally and vertically at the same time. Instead I need real &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; dimensional layout, which is why I need CSS Grid. Fundamentally Grid is 2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a similar kind of layout built with CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31920 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image1-500x275.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-500x275.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-250x138.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1-768x422.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image1.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look closely at the bottom footers. They come together perfectly. And by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-gap&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grid-gap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the lines instead of adding borders to each panel, I don’t have to worry about inconsistent grid line widths. Everything just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-31921 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/02/image2-500x204.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-500x204.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-250x102.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2-768x314.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2018/02/image2.png 1038w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit I get from CSS Grid is adapting to changing conditions. My apps often have side panels. I need to make sure everything in the layout works regardless of whether the panels are expanded or collapsed, ideally without having to recalculate layout in JavaScript. Sidebars are made out of multiple components like headers and footers. All of these need to line up, regardless of which one is larger or smaller.  Grid can do this too using a magic function called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;minmax()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve studied CSS Grid before then you know you can define your layout using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; for the rows and columns.  A template like &lt;code&gt;200px 1fr 200px&lt;/code&gt; will give you 200px wide sidebars with a middle content area taking up the rest of the space. But what happens if the panel should collapse? Right now the column would stay at 200px, even though the content has shrunk. Instead we can use &lt;code&gt;minmax&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;min-content&lt;/code&gt; keyword for the max parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#grid &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;box-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;border-box&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;width&lt;/strong&gt;: 100&lt;strong&gt;vw&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;height&lt;/strong&gt;: 100&lt;strong&gt;vh&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/strong&gt;: 
      [&lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;minmax&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;min-content&lt;/strong&gt;) 
      [&lt;strong&gt;center&lt;/strong&gt;]1&lt;strong&gt;fr &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;minmax&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;min-content&lt;/strong&gt;);
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/strong&gt;: 
      [&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;]2&lt;strong&gt;em &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt;]1&lt;strong&gt;fr &lt;/strong&gt;
      [&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;]2&lt;strong&gt;em&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-gap&lt;/strong&gt;: 1&lt;strong&gt;px&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;background-color&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;black&lt;/strong&gt;;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the grid column will be always be just wide enough to hold whatever is in any of the columns using their &lt;em&gt;minimum width&lt;/em&gt;. Thus if one part of the column (say the header) is wider than the others, the column will expand to fit them all. If they become skinnier or disappear altogether, then the column will adjust accordingly. Essentially we have replicated the expanding/contracting behavior of Flexbox, but made it work with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in the column together, not just one item. This is &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; 2D layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the rest of the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.&lt;strong&gt;start &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;center &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;center&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;end &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-column&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-row&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;grid-row&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
.&lt;strong&gt;sidebar &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;overflow&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;auto&lt;/strong&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;grid&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-left&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle left&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;header&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

 
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start sidebar&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;sidebar&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center content&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;the center content&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;div &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end sidebar&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  sidebar&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;br&lt;/strong&gt;/&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
 
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;left footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;center footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;footer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;right footer&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;div&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the toggle buttons in the upper header actually hide the sidebars I added this code. Note that with modern DOM APIs and arrow functions we can essentially replicate JQuery in just a few lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$ &lt;/em&gt;= (selector) =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.querySelector(selector)
&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$$ &lt;/em&gt;= (selector) =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;document&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.querySelectorAll(selector)
&lt;strong&gt;const &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;on &lt;/em&gt;= (elem, type, listener) =&amp;gt; elem.addEventListener(type,listener)

&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;'#toggle-left'&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;strong&gt;'click'&lt;/strong&gt;,()=&amp;gt;{
  &lt;em&gt;$$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;.start&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;).forEach((elem) =&amp;gt; elem.classList.toggle(&lt;strong&gt;'closed'&lt;/strong&gt;))
})
&lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;'#toggle-right'&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;strong&gt;'click'&lt;/strong&gt;,()=&amp;gt;{
  &lt;em&gt;$$&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;&quot;.end&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;).forEach((elem) =&amp;gt; elem.classList.toggle(&lt;strong&gt;'closed'&lt;/strong&gt;))
})
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that CSS Grid &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; deprecate Flexbox. We still use Flexbox in the cases where it makes sense: namely one dimensional content like toolbars. Here are the styles that I’m using for my toolbars made out of headers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;

&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;center&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-left&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle left&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;open&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;save&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;spacer&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;filename.txt&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;span &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;class=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;spacer&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;span&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;delete&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;button &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;id=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;toggle-right&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;toggle right&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;strong&gt;header &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;background-color&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;#ccc&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;display&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;flex&lt;/strong&gt;;
  &lt;strong&gt;flex-direction&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;row&lt;/strong&gt;;
}

.&lt;strong&gt;spacer &lt;/strong&gt;{
  &lt;strong&gt;flex&lt;/strong&gt;: 1;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;spacer&lt;/code&gt; class makes an element take up all of the extra space. By using two spacers between the buttons I can make my toolbar shrink and grow as needed with the filename always in the middle. This is similar to native toolbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try out a demo live at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/joshmarinacci/full/EQXyvM&quot;&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt;, then remix it to poke and prod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS Grid is wonderful for designing interactive applications with two-dimensional complexity. We can keep the markup semantic. Panels and toolbar line up properly. The &lt;code&gt;grid-gap&lt;/code&gt; gives us automatic borders. It adjusts our layout in complex ways without any JavaScript code, and it gives us control over both the horizontal and vertical. And we can do it all &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; using a heavy CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Simmons has started a new YouTube channel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag&quot;&gt;Layout Land&lt;/a&gt; to help you grok how Grid works.  If you work on web apps or any kind of richly interactive website, you should try out CSS Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The IRS’s Effort to Convert Its Assembly Codebase to Java</title>
<link>https://federalnewsradio.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/01/irs-clutches-its-modernization-holy-grail/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://federalnewsradio.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/01/irs-clutches-its-modernization-holy-grail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;2018 could be the year the IRS crosses the final frontier in its 25-year modernization drive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the agency has a short-term crisis. It has to translate the complicated new tax law into computer code. Its programmers must find all of the lines affected among millions of lines of code.  Their challenge is mainly time and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency does some code revision every year.  But the scope this year is much larger than anything since the Reagan-era tax reforms…plus the underlying code has 36 more years worth of alterations preceding these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT is only part of the challenge. IRS needs new forms, new advisories, new instructions, and new training for its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo-main&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;promo_dash&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;Insight by Booz Allen Hamilton: Technology experts explore cyber engineering in government in this free webinar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRS gets knocks because so much of its code is written in assembler. Successive commissioners have described this code in countless hearings. Assembler is like Shakespearean English. It’s dated. A shrinking number of people can deal with it. But it’s also elegant and  highly functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this code has functioned through more than 50 filing seasons testifies to its durability. That it still works after countless alterations because of ever-changing policy testifies to the talent of the IRS work force. But assembler experts are becoming scarce, and IRS is called on to do much more than batch processing for which its assembler applications were optimized. Electronic filing, business intelligence, anti-fraud activities — all have spurred development of systems in a variety of architectures and languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus IRS operates many inter-related systems. It’s modernization efforts have produced some successes. But none of the efforts, none of the companies involved — principally the former Computer Sciences Corp. and IBM — have been able to solve what everyone understands is an essential key to modernizing. Namely, the individual and business master files that still exist as entities coded in assembler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, IRS is on the verge of solving this problem.  The solution was engineered by a group of about eight people. And not under a multi-hundred-million-dollar systems integration contract. A leader of the group &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; Jian Wang, a Chinese emigre who is now a naturalized citizen. Wang told me his solution isn’t a silver bullet but rather a carefully worked-out methodology. It has three components so potentially powerful the IRS has filed patent applications for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;” because he’s left the agency, and the status of the project is dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang was working under streamlined critical pay authority the agency has had since its landmark 1998 restructuring. It gave the IRS 40 slots under which it could pay temporary, full-time employees higher than GS rates. Former Commissioner John Koskinen pointed out Congress did not re-up this authority in 2013, despite his entreaties to former Congressman Jason Chaffetz’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo-main&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;promo_dash&quot;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;An agency-by-agency look at the 2019 budget request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last one ran out this past summer,” Koskinen said. The departures included Wang. He says he applied to become a GS-15 or Senior Executive Service member so he could see through the assembler-to-Java project. But his approval didn’t come through until a week before his employment authority expired. By then he’d accepted another job. Wang says he had a house to pay for, kids to educate. Koskinen confirms the agency wanted to convert Wang. But the process of approval from Treasury headquarters and the Office of Personnel Management simply took too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the National Press Club last April, Koskinen mentioned Wang and his colleague Mark Yu “who developed a method for translating the programming language used in our legacy tax processing applications into the JAVA language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang explained his solution to assembler conversion to me in some detail. It proceeds from the fact that “in theory, there’s no way to translate assembler code. They way it runs is not how it reads.” Indeed, because it is so tightly coupled to machine instruction sets, assembler looks totally cryptic to 21st century programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang and his team nonetheless developed a logical translation component, a “technical rule language” that acts as an intermediate stage to retain the logic withdrawn from the assembler, and a data extractor. By separating out the data, Wang says it was possible to trace the assembler logic flows, then abstract it into structured code in the technical rule language. He says testing proved the three parts could result in a Java program that accurately reproduces what the assembler code does. He said this was proven using production-sized data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early, comic&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac2fWCwDH9Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; application&lt;/a&gt; of motion picture technology titled “Dog Factory” shows pooches being “translated” into coils of sausages and back again by a big, hand-cranked machine. (Thank you, Library of Congress for preserving this gem.) Converting assembler code won’t be such a simple input-output matter. The IRS has thousands of assembly modules. The resulting Java must be tested for interoperability with all the others and for security. But Wang’s work shows it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked with former IRS chief technology officer Terry Milholland. He said, “They were literally at the stage of converting assembler to Java when Wang left.” In fact, Milholland’s own special employment authority also ended then. He believes IRS has bid out this work. “It’s frustrating to see what’s possible but not happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve asked IRS repeatedly over a period of weeks to clarify what is going on, but so far it hasn’t made anyone who might know available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the individual and business master files were coded in the early 1960s, assembler was an ideal solution. Computers and memory of the day were expensive. An IBM computer typically came with 512K of memory. But the IRS knew what it was doing. For example, in 1975, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=HwniRloeB6cC&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;lpg=PA2&amp;amp;dq=IRS+master+tape+file&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DOlnheGYi_&amp;amp;sig=Hz4riWGF2iodxheH4aRn_T4lRjY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxjefX5qfYAhWoYd8KHVSGAcAQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=IRS%20master%20tape%20file&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Computerworld reported&lt;/a&gt; how IRS programmers handled a tax rebate program signed into law by President Gerald Ford. IRS used six IBM S/360s, each with 512K of memory, and an S/370 with 2M of memory. The machines drew on a total of 68 tape drives. The rebate job was scheduled to take five batch cycles of 320 hours each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, assembler is still excellent for this application. Milholland said of the code, “The assembler is well written. It’s incredibly efficient and effective.” But a shrinking number of people understand it. And it’s not optimized for the online, transaction mode to which the IRS needs to keep moving. Java, relatively inefficient as it may be, is the current standard and has legions of people who know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Wang is at another agency as a GS-15. This agency also has lots of legacy code, but it’s Cobol. Wang chuckled when I joked, compared to assembler, Cobol would be a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRS techies seem to have a solution to their ultimate modernization puzzle in hand. If so, the question is whether they’ll use it.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;dtrace for linux; Oracle does the right thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted on February 14, 2018, 11:13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot; readability=&quot;69.253246753247&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fosdem we had a talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/debugging_tools_dtrace/&quot;&gt;dtrace for linux&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/debugging_tools/&quot;&gt;Debugging Tools devroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not explicitly mentioned in that talk, but certainly the most exciting thing, is that Oracle is doing a proper linux kernel port:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 commit &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-uek.git;a=commitdiff;h=e1744f50ee9bc1978d41db7cc93bcf30687853e6&quot;&gt;e1744f50ee9bc1978d41db7cc93bcf30687853e6&lt;/a&gt;

 dtrace: Integrate DTrace Modules into kernel proper

 This changeset integrates DTrace module sources into the main kernel
 source tree under the GPLv2 license. Sources have been moved to
 appropriate locations in the kernel tree.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is right, dtrace dropped the CDDL and switched to the GPL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user space code &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=dtrace-utils.git;a=summary&quot;&gt;dtrace-utils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=libdtrace-ctf.git;a=summary&quot;&gt;libdtrace-ctf&lt;/a&gt; (a combination of GPLv2 and UPL) can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace/source.html&quot;&gt;DTrace Project Source Control&lt;/a&gt; page. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace/news/article_012.html&quot;&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt; file mentions the license switch (and that it is build upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://elfutils.org/&quot;&gt;elfutils&lt;/a&gt;, which I personally was pleased to find out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel sources (GPLv2+ for the core kernel and UPL for the uapi) are slightly harder to find because they are inside the uek kernel source tree, but following the above commit you can easily get at the whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://oss.oracle.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-uek.git;a=tree;f=dtrace;h=2d9934ed1fe267abcb6893202cf6d4929f8efdea;hb=f8f4c2fe36f8a8e91564ad6e23e074632a2b14bf&quot;&gt;linux kernel dtrace&lt;/a&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UPL is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/UPL&quot;&gt;Universal Permissive License&lt;/a&gt;, which according to the FSF is a lax, non-copyleft license that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/universal-permissive-license-added-to-license-list&quot;&gt;compatible with the GNU GPL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Oracle for making everyone’s life easier by &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/&quot;&gt;waving your magic relicensing wand&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is lots of hard work to do to actually properly integrate this. And I am sure there are a lot of technical hurdles when trying to get this upstreamed into the mainline kernel. But that is just hard work. Which we can now start collaborating on in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceware.org/systemtap/&quot;&gt;systemtap&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceware.org/systemtap/kprobes/docs.html&quot;&gt;Dynamic Probes&lt;/a&gt; (dprobes) before it, dtrace is a whole system observability tool combining tracing, profiling and probing/debugging techniques. Something the upstream linux kernel hackers don’t always appreciate when presented as one large system. They prefer having separate small tweaks for tracing, profiling and probing which are mostly separate from each other. It took years for the various hooks, kprobes, uprobes, markers, etc. from systemtap (and other systems) to get upstream. But these days they are. And there is now even a byte code interpreter (eBPF) in the mainline kernel as originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceware.org/systemtap/kprobes/docs/dprobes/freenix01/FNX2001.pdf&quot;&gt;envisioned by dprobes&lt;/a&gt;, which systemtap can now target through &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/12/13/introducing-stapbpf-systemtaps-new-bpf-backend/&quot;&gt;stapbpf&lt;/a&gt;. So with all those techniques now available in the linux kernel it will be exciting to see if dtrace for linux can unite them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Germany considers free public transport in fight to banish air pollution</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia. Photo: DPA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Car nation&quot; Germany has surprised neighbours with a radical proposal to reduce road traffic by making public transport free, as Berlin scrambles to meet EU air pollution targets and avoid big fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-body&quot; readability=&quot;136.21709006928&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes just over two years after Volkswagen's devastating &quot;dieselgate&quot; emissions cheating scandal unleashed a wave of anger at the auto industry, a keystone of German prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are considering public transport free of charge in order to reduce the number of private cars,&quot; three ministers including Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks wrote to EU Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella in the letter seen by AFP Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.de/20180214/government-plays-down-free-public-transport-plan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;German government plays down 'free public transport' plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Effectively fighting air pollution without any further unnecessary delays is of the highest priority for Germany,&quot; the ministers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal will be tested by &quot;the end of this year at the latest&quot; in five cities across western Germany, including former capital Bonn and industrial cities Essen and Mannheim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a radical one for the normally staid world of German politics -- especially as Chancellor Angela Merkel is presently only governing in a caretaker capacity, as Berlin waits for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) to confirm a hard-fought coalition deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of ticketless travel, other steps proposed Tuesday include further restrictions on emissions from vehicle fleets like buses and taxis, low-emissions zones or support for car-sharing schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action is needed soon, as Germany and eight fellow EU members including Spain, France and Italy sailed past a January 30th deadline to meet EU limits on nitrogen dioxide and fine particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brussels environment chief Vella gave countries extra time to present further pollution-busting measures or face legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life-threatening&quot; pollution affects more than 130 cities in Europe, according to the Commission, causing some 400,000 deaths and costing €20 billion ($24.7 billion) in health spending per year in the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries that fail to keep to EU limits could face legal action at the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest tribunal, which can levy fines on member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without the pressure from Brussels, air quality has surged to the top of Berlin's priorities over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicions over manipulated emissions data have spread to other car manufacturers since Volkswagen's 2015 admission to cheating regulatory tests on 11 million vehicles worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists brought court cases aimed at banning diesels from parts of some city centres, and fears millions of drivers could be affected spurred Chancellor Angela Merkel into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titans like BMW, Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler or the world's biggest carmaker Volkswagen agreed to pay some €250 million into a billion-euro fund to upgrade local transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &quot;should make sure that the car manufacturers finance the emergency measure&quot; of free transport, Greenpeace urged, adding that more parking and road tolls in cities could help reduce urban traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their own account, the auto firms have stepped up plans to electrify their ranges, with a barrage of battery-powered or hybrid models planned for the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feet of clay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public transport is highly popular in Germany, with the number of journeys increasing regularly over the past 20 years to reach 10.3 billion in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with other major European nations, tickets can be cheap: a single ticket in Berlin costs €2.90, while the equivalent on the London Underground costs 4.90 pounds (€5.50 or $6.80).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cities were quick to warn that more planning was needed if free travel was to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know any manufacturer who would be able to deliver the number of electric buses we would need&quot; to meet increased demand if transport was free, Bonn mayor Ashok Sridharan told news agency DPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Association of German Cities chief Helmut Dedy warned that &quot;we expect a clear statement about how (free transport) will be financed&quot; from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other attempts around the world to offer citizens free travel have failed, including in US city Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers &quot;should think again during a ride on the U6 (underground line) in Berlin at 7.30 am,&quot; Die Welt newspaper commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The conclusion would be clear: more carriages, more personnel, and maybe even more tracks and lines would be needed. Where would the billions for that come from?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
