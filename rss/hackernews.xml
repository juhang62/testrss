<title>The Internet of Beefs</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard me talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/10/29/crash-only-thinking/&quot;&gt;crash-only programming&lt;/a&gt;, right? It’s a programming paradigm for critical infrastructure systems, where there is — by design — no graceful way to shut down. A program can only crash and try to recover from a crashed state, which might well be impossible. I came up with a term for the human version: &lt;em&gt;beef-only thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/internetOfbeefs2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6731&quot; srcset=&quot;https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/internetOfbeefs2.png 800w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/internetOfbeefs2-300x188.png 300w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/internetOfbeefs2-768x480.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beef-only thinker is someone you cannot simply &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; to. Anything that is not an expression of pure, unqualified support for whatever they are doing or saying is received as a mark of disrespect, and a provocation to conflict. From there, you can only crash into honor-based conflict mode, or back away and disengage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection to crash-only programming is more than cosmetic, but it will take some set-up before I can establish the conceptual bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-6728&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online public spaces are now being slowly taken over by beef-only thinkers, as the global culture wars evolve into a stable, endemic, background societal condition of continuous conflict. As the Great Weirding morphs into the Permaweird, the public internet is turning into the Internet of Beefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Beefs, or IoB, is everywhere, on all platforms, all the time. Meatspace is just a source of matériel to be deployed online, possibly after some tasteful editing, decontextualization, and now AI-assisted manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you participate in online public life, you cannot entirely avoid the Internet of Beefs. It is too big, too ubiquitous, and too widely distributed and connected across platforms. To continue operating in public spaces without being drawn into the conflict, you have to build an arsenal of passive-aggressive behaviors like subtweeting, ghosting, blocking, and muting — all while ignoring beef-only thinkers calling you out furiously as dishonorable and cowardly, and trying to bait you into active aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your only other option is to retreat to a shadowy network of private spaces defended by blocks, restricted feeds, secret-group gatekeeping boundaries, and subscribers-only paywalls. A sort of underground Internet that I’ve previously called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe&quot;&gt;CozyWeb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beefing is everywhere on the internet. Bernie and Warren beef with each other and with Trump, different schools of economists beef with each other over trade policy, climate hawks beef with climate doves. Here you see Slavoj Žižek and Jordan Peterson taking their beef offline. There you see Ben Shapiro attempt to bait Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into a live beef for the hundredth time. And over on that side, we find Jesse Singal beefing with trans activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in one corner by himself, of course, is Nassim Taleb beefing with all comers on all topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulk, smash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb muddying the factional boundaries of the culture war is one of the few genuinely amusing theaters of the conflict on the IoB. The blast radius around his twitter feed is not a safe space for anyone besides members of his own cult of Mesopotamian personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is just the North American, English-language theater of the IoB (the other major one I’m familiar with, the Indian theater, is much worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mooks and Knights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important beefs though, are not between celebrities at all, but among the anonymous masses who face off under their banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict on the IoB is not governed by any sort of grand strategy, or even particularly governed by ideological doctrines. It is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/10/18/unflattening-hobbes/&quot;&gt;unflattened Hobbesian honor-society conflict&lt;/a&gt; with a feudal structure, at the heart of which is an involuntarily anonymous, fungible, angry figure desperate to be seen as significant: the mook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semantic structure of the Internet of Beefs is shaped by high-profile beefs between charismatic celebrity knights loosely affiliated with various citadel-like strongholds peopled by opt-in armies of mooks. The vast majority of the energy of the conflict lies in interchangeable mooks facing off against each other, loosely along lines indicated by the knights they follow, in innumerable battles that play out every minute across the IoB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost none of these battles matter individually. Most mook-on-mook contests are witnessed, for the most part, only by a few friends and algorithms, and merit no overt notice in either Vox or Quillette. Beyond a local uptick in cortisol levels, individual episodes of mook-on-mook violence are of no consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In aggregate though, they matter. A lot. They are the &lt;em&gt;raison d’être&lt;/em&gt; of the IoB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard pattern of conflict on the IoB is depressingly predictable. A mook takes note of a &lt;em&gt;casus belli&lt;/em&gt; in the news cycle (often created or co-opted by a knight, and referred to on the IoB as the outrage cycle), and heads over to their favorite multiplayer online battle arena (Twitter being the most important MOBA) to join known mook allies to fight stereotypically familiar but often unknown interchangeable mook foes. They come prepared either to melee within the core, or skirmish on the periphery, either rallying around the knights riding under known beef-only banners, or adventuring by themselves in unflagged, unheralded side battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no higher honor for a mook than to be noticed by the knights they fight for. As a result, the fealty of the mook is the currency of the manorial economy of the IoB. Mookcoins are mined by knights through acts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/e/memes/notice-me-senpai/&quot;&gt;senpai-notice-me&lt;/a&gt;. Call it proof-of-favor. And on mookcoins runs the economy of the IoB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mook once animated by a grievance is hard to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loyalties might shift through knightly sell-outs and betrayals, and mook allegiances might shift individually or &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt; in ideologically incoherent ways, but once the psyche of a mook becomes animated by grievance-power, there is no going back. It is an almost irreversible sort of dehumanization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more mooks a knight of the IoB can maintain in a stable state of combat-readiness, the bigger a player they are on the IoB. If you are blessed with a better, beefier class of mook in your army, capable of sustaining and dishing out more damage points, they will even win over mooks from adjacent theaters of conflict for you, and perhaps even bait a few frustrated non-combatants (not the same as NPCs, who are in fact a class of combatant present on all sides) into joining the conflict. To the seasoned knight, it doesn’t matter whether a new mook joins on their side or the other side; the point is to grow and sustain the conflict rather than win (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be a knight, of course, is to have a recognized name, and a storied reputation as a beef-only thinker to be reckoned with; one capable of owning opposed knights (and “absolutely eviscerating” them in strategically edited YouTube clips). Knights might be affiliated with a known imperial banner, or less frequently, freelancers like Taleb (the term freelancer comes from mercenary knights, with no fixed loyalties, in the medieval era).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrality of mooks is an important point that is often overlooked (often by knights and mooks themselves) because of the obvious insignificance of any particular mook in isolation. In aggregate, however, mook power is what the IoB is &lt;em&gt;about.&lt;/em&gt; If the relatively peaceful web of the 90s and aughts was about civilian eyeballs, the IoB is about mook-on-mook combat clicks, and is now entering its second decade (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1211086727437148160&quot;&gt;Searing Twenties&lt;/a&gt; is the eyeball-roasting name I’ve entered into the naming contest; fite me irl if you disagree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology of the IoB is the technology of pitting crowds of mooks against one another, as Renee DiResta presciently pointed out in her 2016 post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/15/crowds-and-technology/&quot;&gt;Crowds and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (now the trailhead of a 4-part primer on the IoB; read the whole thing if all this is new to you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict on the IoB is shaped not by the strategic intentions of its nominal leaders (who largely have none, beyond keeping the conflict profitably alive and growing), but by emotional energy flows in the field of mooks. The best knights on the IoB, such as Trump, operate by an entirely reactive philosophy: “there go my mooks; I must find out where they are going, so I can get out in front and lead them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual belief is a liability on the IoB. The more a knight of the IoB genuinely believes in whatever principle they think they are fighting for, the less effective they are as wranglers of fickle mook energy. Sincerely ideological players routinely overestimate the depth of intellectual coherence required to accumulate and wield mook power, producing nerdy intellectual edifices where mere covfefe gestures would not just do the job, but actually do it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very best knights of the IoB carry on their beef-only cultural conflicts only because the mooks make it profitable for them to do so. For the mook, the conflict is a means to an end, however incoherent. For the knight, the conflict &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the end. Growing it, and keeping it going, is something like an entrepreneurial cultural capital business model (one with no exit from the hell-market of other people; Sartre would be proud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If conflict in any particular theater shows dangerous signs of actually resolving itself, another must be spun up to take its place, much as businesses that hope to survive must replace markets in decline with new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, on the IoB, the only meaningful transaction is the pitched battle between armies of mooks, the equivalent of a viral hit. The bloodier and stupider, the better for the instigating knights on all sides. The greater the futility, the more useful, since it reinforces a disposition towards conflict for the sake of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy is not just absent, it is an outright liability, since it might encourage negotiation and compromise, lower the social-death body-count of faceless mooks, inhibit GDP growth in the mook manorial economy, and worst of all, potentially &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mook Manorialism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common posture among the Knights of the IoB — one that is more often clueless than disingenuous — is that the mooks are not important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the knights are neither responsible for what the mooks do, nor accountable for the views held by mooks who fight under their banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the existence of mooks is merely a sort of unfortunate and unavoidable natural side-effect, rather than the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the work of mining more mooks through senpai-notice-me marks of favor is innocent &lt;em&gt;noblesse oblige&lt;/em&gt; towards an oppressed population that one reluctantly leads, rather than a profitable grievance mine that one lives off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the excesses of one’s own mooks are both overstated and forgivable as crimes of temporary, misguided, and justified exuberance, while those of the other side’s mooks embody the spiritual, if not biological, end of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That they are engaged in high-minded cultural battles for the soul of society against dishonorable opposition fatally compromised by bad faith, while themselves only reluctantly entering the battlefield out of a sense of duty, and bound by a code of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/07/mjd-58855/&quot;&gt;reasonable, unbiased, balanced conduct&lt;/a&gt;, even if it means nobly marching to martyrdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this posture &lt;em&gt;mook manorialism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posture is similar to, and indeed overlaps with, the postures of revolutionary leaders who instigate what has come to be known as stochastic terrorism. The difference is that the Lord of a Mook Manor maintains a sanitary ideological distance from his mooks while keeping them tactically close on the IoB: close enough to hear dogwhistles and take tactical cues from their own marquee jousts, distant enough for plausible &lt;em&gt;ideological&lt;/em&gt; deniability. Unlike the leaders of ISIS, IoB knights are not particularly eager to take responsibility for terror attacks under their banners, only to profit from their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mook manorialism is an economy based on axe-grinding. As the peasantry, mooks do more than fight other mooks. They are also responsible for keeping grievances large and small well-nursed and alive. Occasionally, through an act like whistleblowing or leaking of confidential communications, a mook might briefly become a named player in a particular theater of conflict, but the median mook is primarily expected to keep everyday grievances alive and fight under the glare of algorithmic lights when called upon to do so, unrecognized by history, but counted in the statistics and noticed by the AIs (senpAIs?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, unless you do something dumb that makes you vulnerable to being drawn into the mook-manorial economy against your will, such as saying something that can be used against you while in a position of authority in an important institution, the IoB is an opt-in conflict arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only opt-in to the Internet of Beefs driven by a sincere grievance if you are mook enough to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. If you aren’t, and you haven’t fallen into the IoB by becoming vulnerable or compromised in some way, you are there either because you’ve been baited in, or because you are profiting from its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arsenal of baiting techniques on display is impressive. At the lowest level, mooks are created primarily through the taunting and mockery of pre-existing mooks, and the rare notices of beefing senpais (and viral-celebrity creating senpAIs). At the highest level, women (and some men) play a particularly important role, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Thirst%20Trap&quot;&gt;thirst-trap&lt;/a&gt; players in ideological clothing, drawing in wannabe knights eager to fight for, among other things, their honor and a higher-value currency of attention. If senpai-notices power the mooks, thirst-trap notices power half the knights. If the mooks are maintained in a state of continuous partial grievance by the knights, the knights are maintained in a state of continuously parched replyguy frustration by the thirst traps in their high towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, behind the scenes there are organized state and non-state actors, from Putin on down, adding fuel to every convenient fire, and occasionally starting fires where there are no convenient pre-existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultures of Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most grimly amusing aspects of the IoB is that the endemic conflict unfolding endlessly and pointlessly on it is called a &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; war. So what exactly is &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt; about the culture war?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nominal bones of contention, such as representation in movies, or the status of the Western canon or enlightenment values in higher-education, appear to simply be convenient recruitment hooks that conform in fairly obvious ways to mook identities. The culture wars are no more identitarian and cultural by virtue of the content than any other war, as far as I can tell. And certainly beefing on the IoB does little to satisfyingly settle questions of identity one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that it has few literal casualties, perhaps the conflict itself can be viewed as a form of artistic cultural production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you enjoy the show, but I suspect most observers are with me in concluding that the Internet of Beefs is largely bereft of aesthetic merit, and infinitely more capable of producing cortisol than art. Even the actual patterns of conflict are devoid of the sort of visible strategic artistry that might warm the souls of connoisseurs of the military arts. The IoB is just relentless, ugly, shittiness, unredeemed by any actual cultural production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask again, what is cultural about the culture wars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect it is the centrality of beefing — a stylized, theatrical pattern of conflict designed to present a theater of moral righteousness, signal virtues, visibly strive towards a declared utopian condition, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;resist meaningful resolution&lt;/em&gt;. The conflict must be as impossible to terminate as the notional utopias being sought are impossible to actually attain. Beefing, in other words, is a lousy way to conduct or resolve an unsustainable conflict, but an excellent way to perpetuate and grow a sustainable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nature of Beefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me offer a definition, inspired by Huizenga’s treatment of pre-modern conflict in &lt;em&gt;Homo Ludens:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beef is a ritualized, extended conflict between named, evenly matched combatants who each stand for a marquee ideological position, and most importantly, reciprocate each other’s hostile feelings in active, engaged ways. A beef is something like the evil twin of a love affair. A beef must be conducted with visible skill and honor (though codes of honor may be different on the different sides), and in public view. Each combatant must be viewed, by his or her supporters, as having picked a worthy adversary, otherwise the contest means nothing. The combatants fight not for material advantage, but for a symbolic victory that can be read as signifying the cosmic, spiritual righteousness and rightness of what they are fighting for. So the conflict must be at least nominally fair, hard to call decisively, and open to luck, cunning cheating, and &lt;em&gt;ex-post&lt;/em&gt; mythologizing by all sides, in terms favorable to their own champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A IoB beef is not mere trash-talk among people who are obviously friends, accompanied by laughter and signs of affection. Whether real or staged, a beef must present the appearance of a genuine conflict to the mook audience. Umbrage must be taken and seen to be taken. Insults must be hurled. The venom must seem real. The mutual dislike must be palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beef then, is ideally prosecuted via a series of ideological coin-tosses, conducted with emotional sincerity and an honorable display of prowess by the worthiest and most well-matched combatants, designed to discover what the gods will for the future of humanity, and which tribe of mooks they have picked out as the chosen people, destined to survive the culture war and come out the other end (date TBD) with identities intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, an absolutely silly way to conduct a conflict one intends to decisively win and replace with a pragmatic peace. In a real conflict, you would seek an overwhelming advantage, and ideally, to win without firing a shot, at no cost. On the IoB, knights seek balanced matches, actual fighting, and no outcome, at the highest cost possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot predict the course of a culture war by trying to understand it as a military conflict. You can only predict it by trying to understand it as the deliberate perpetuation of a &lt;em&gt;culture of conflict&lt;/em&gt; by those with an interest in keeping it alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is useful to look at beefs in the artistic and sporting worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Beef Element in Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beefs, of course, are a staple of the arts, in which we can include sports. Artists must war with words to make their presence in the world felt. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/rivalry-feud/varieties-ether?fbclid=IwAR1emZ3PnjA-QCqw0kwCTvYv1RdATwryXp-Ng9I-A2IR2-Xxu4gw_y3QWKQ&quot;&gt;this excellent essay by Hua Hsu argues&lt;/a&gt;, beefs, rather than actual works of art, are the dominant currency of the creative world. You are only as good as your beefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, to increase the beef quotient of an art or sport, you have to reduce the level of the actual conflict and skill in favor of the staged kind. That’s how you get from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.T.F._(South_Park)&quot;&gt;wrassling to professional wrestling&lt;/a&gt;. You have to head towards more mannered, stylized, genre forms of cultural production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more a scene shaped by artistic or athletic beefs conforms to a mannered and generic aesthetic, the easier it is for mook consumers to appreciate the formulaic, legible artistry on display, and tediously imitate it in their own anonymous beefing on the sidelines. What little actual taste the mook has requires highly legible conventions and tropes to feed on. Subtlety and nuance are lost on the mook. To demand imagination from a mook is to render him less effective on the battlefield. Only near-robotic programming will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the presence of a beef does not always indicate the presence of beef-only thinking. It might be scripted or improvised theater, it might be incompetently pursued real conflict, or it might be something in that zone of quantum indeterminacy known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe&quot;&gt;kayfabe&lt;/a&gt;. But I suspect beefing in the creative world is more serious than people suspect. It is easier to imagine poets actively hating each other than football players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peculiar mix of sensitivity and insecurity in the artistic psyche is a recipe for genuinely beefy sensibilities. As Hsu observes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stands to reason that artists who possess a sensitivity to human nature would themselves be hypersensitive people. And it makes sense that those with gifts for storytelling and narration are capable of shaping petty jealousy into something noble and epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, unlike the worlds of art and sport, where beefing is traditionally part of the game, and central to the production of culture that enriches the life of the spectator, the Internet of Beefs produces neither great works of art, nor enthralling spectacles. It is beefing for the sake of beefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%F0%9F%8D%BF&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;use of the 🍿emoji&lt;/a&gt; merely indicates an active beef in progress, and some potential for schadenfreude, but you’re better off reading 🍿as a marker of crossfire danger than movie-like entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Beefs, unlike the worlds of sport, faux-sport, and art, is full of artless, productless beefing rife with genuine, sometimes deadly, hostility. The most dangerous players are not the most celebrated knights, but the mookiest mooks, animated by a sincere belief that they too, are knights, unable to recognize their own essential inconsequentiality, and mistaking their literacy in a discourse for ironic above-the-ordinary-mook stature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IoB is, at its core, a vast zone of wartime fan fiction generated by copypasta mooks LARPing knightly patterns of conflict, and attempting to write themselves into the end of history as heroic Mary Sues, one meme at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being After Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What separates the knight from the mook, of course, is not a nerdy literacy in a particular beef-only discourse, but a capacity for a profitable originality within it. The mark of a knight of the vast round table of the Internet of Beefs is the relentless pursuit of the Holy Grift. A mercantile mission for the end of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a novel observation. Every non-combatant observer of the culture wars appears to have arrived at this conclusion, and many prominent knights have admitted it in private. The signs of a core economy of profiteering and carpetbagging are just too unmistakeable. This does not mean that there isn’t a core of actual missionary sentiment driving most knights. It just means, push come to shove, that the grifting motive will rule behavior rather than ideological ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grifters keep the culture war going, but did they &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; it? This might be the most basic political question of our times, and I believe the answer is &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic mistake made by many watchers of the culture war is to assume that grifter knights did in fact create the mook manorial economy that sustains them. That it is not only being sustained top-down, but was in fact created top-down, by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story goes: state actors, media empires, and technology platform companies enable the IoB infrastructure level as an economic sector. The knights of the IoB, whether missionary axe-grinders, mercenary freelancers, or something in between, use that infrastructure skillfully to downgrade innocent humans into mooks, and keep them profitably angry and fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the mooks fight, the knights make money. While the knights make money, state actors and technology companies reshape the map of the world to rule it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a tempting theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are even stylized patterns of conflict that suggest such a top-down designed order beneath the chaos of the conflict. There is the brinkmanship of cancel culture. There is the insistent baiting of “civil debate” culture. There is the presence of supposedly addictive UX patterns. There are powerful state cyberwar agencies. And everywhere, all around, there is the constant, exhausting cosmic background radiation of relentless, sleepless, slightly panicked mockery of the outgroup led by the knightly class. It is tempting to believe that this is a world in which your average mook has no agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tempting but wrong; it is a theory that flatters the conceit of the knightly class and state actors that they, rather than the zombie mooks, are in fact in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooks believe this too, because it is a pleasant conspiracy theory that lets them off the hook: regular human beings are naturally nice and peaceable, and evil powers-that-be dehumanize them into zombie-mook armies through their evil Bond-villain ex-machinations. And the only reason they are fighting on Side X is because the worst of the Bond villains are on the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; side. They are merely honorably choosing the least among many evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this is mere self-congratulation by self-important knights and mooks. If it were that simple, a round of tasteful guillotining would achieve peacemaking miracles, liberate the mooks, raise their consciousness, and produce the kind of utopia yellow-jacketed France is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and non-state actors act to enable the IoB &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the existence of the knights makes it valuable to do so. The knights exist profitably &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the mooks enable them to. The IoB is an economy of opportunity created by the human condition at the end of history. It is a consequence rather than the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all about the mooks. It’s always been about the mooks. About the economic and political opportunities presented by the curse of downcycled human resources available for one last, long harvest before the machine butlers replace them. To mint a mook is not an act against history. Just a gentle nudge to accelerate an almost inevitable outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question really is: where did the mooks come from? A speculative answer I’m working on takes the theories of Francis Fukuyama to a conclusion he himself has been reluctant to take them lately: The mooks were born of the End of History, as zombie Last Persons; pale shadows of dead archetypes drawn from many imagined histories. Histories that are all thirty years past their terminus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That then is the mook: a Last Person fighting soullessly over the right to perpetuate a dead identity as a Mary Sue protagonist of unbearably bad fan fictions of nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rebooting History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events, even seemingly &lt;em&gt;historic&lt;/em&gt; events, continuing to happen does not mean history is continuing past its end. I am convinced — even as Fukuyama himself (come at me bro) walks back his theories — that history &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; in fact end with the fall of the Berlin War, and that the emergence of vast mook classes around the world is a natural consequence. History ends not when the stream of apparently historic events ends, but when the world loses a sense of a continuing narrative, and arrives at what psychologists call a sense of a foreshortened future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happened in 1989, even if took nearly 30 years for everybody to get the memo, and get Very Online to beef about it, leaving lonely billionaires dreaming of space colonies peopled — and roboted — by a less disheartening post-historical transhuman species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the Internet of Beefs, as a direct consequence of the end of history, presents a difficult challenge for those of us who haven’t been entirely mookified yet and aren’t billionaire enough to dream of living on Mars, served by identityless robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the only way to end the endless Hobbesian war of all against all at the end of history is to reboot history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a trivial undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter of teaching the uncouth mooks some civility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not about beefing knights debating with civility and arriving at a new imaginative consensus understanding (or even a harmonious dissensus understanding) of the human condition and announcing an armistice to the grateful and exhausted mooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not about a return to broad-based prosperity driven by the reversal of climate change, the promise of space exploration, nanotechnology, quantum computing, and CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not about contrite Robber Baron oligarchs suddenly growing a conscience thanks to the sermonizing and shaming of ethicists, and designing more humane technologies into their neoliberal capitalist platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not about guillotines, universal basic incomes, progressive taxation, free college, or debt jubilees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not beefing endlessly because we do not desire peace or because we do not know how to engineer peace. We are beefing because we no longer know who we are, each of us individually, and collectively as a species. Knight and mook alike are faced with the terrifying possibility that if there is no history in the future, there is nobody in particular to be once the beefing stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the only way to reboot history is to figure out new beings to be. Because that’s ultimately what beefing is about: a way to avoid being, without allowing time itself to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being and Beefing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of history is why beef-only thinking is crash-only thinking for humans. The IoB is a way of shorting our collective humanity and crashing old ways of being entirely, with no promise of recovery and reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate is to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But building and maintaining increasingly costly defenses in the form of progressively thickening skin and strengthening force fields of passive aggressive resistance is also unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to retreat into what I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding&quot;&gt;waldenponding&lt;/a&gt; or to the CozyWeb is to cede public spaces entirely to the mook-manorial economy and accelerate the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a no-exit, hellish condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is inescapable: the IoB will shut down, and give way to something better, only when we know who we want to be — individually and collectively — when the beefing stops, and regenerate into that form. Only that will allow history to be rebooted, and time to be restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We who seek to discover a future again, and ways of being that reboot history, by giving ourselves to history as beings for it to be &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We who are Very Online and destined to eventually die on the Internet of Beefs, but do not wish to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all the best questions, this one is at once intensely practical — all about digital hygiene and how to design and use devices of connection to think — and intensely philosophical — about finding ways to be reborn without literally dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have answers, but I like that I finally at least have a question.&lt;/p&gt;

                    The new technique could kill a wide range of cancer cells, including breast and prostate
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A newly-discovered part of our immune system could be harnessed to treat all cancers, say scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cardiff University team discovered a method of killing prostate, breast, lung and other cancers in lab tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/ni/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;The findings, published in Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;, have not been tested in patients, but the researchers say they have &quot;enormous potential&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said that although the work was still at an early stage, it was very exciting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What have they found?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our immune system is our body's natural defence against infection, but it also attacks cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists were looking for &quot;unconventional&quot; and previously undiscovered ways the immune system naturally attacks tumours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was a T-cell inside people's blood. This is an immune cell that can scan the body to assess whether there is a threat that needs to be eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is this one could attack a wide range of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a chance here to treat every patient,&quot; researcher Prof Andrew Sewell told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Previously nobody believed this could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It raises the prospect of a 'one-size-fits-all' cancer treatment, a single type of T-cell that could be capable of destroying many different types of cancers across the population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-cells have &quot;receptors&quot; on their surface that allow them to &quot;see&quot; at a chemical level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cardiff team discovered a T-cell and its receptor that could find and kill a wide range of cancerous cells in the lab including lung, skin, blood, colon, breast, bone, prostate, ovarian, kidney and cervical cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, it left normal tissues untouched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    T-cells attack cancer cells
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how it does this is still being explored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular T-cell receptor interacts with a molecule called MR1, which is on the surface of every cell in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought MR1 is flagging the distorted metabolism going on inside a cancerous cell to the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are the first to describe a T-cell that finds MR1 in cancer cells - that hasn't been done before, this is the first of its kind,&quot; research fellow Garry Dolton told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Why is this significant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-cell cancer therapies already exist and the development of cancer immunotherapy has been one of the most exciting advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most famous example is CAR-T - a living drug made by genetically engineering a patient's T-cells to seek out and destroy cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T can have dramatic results that transform some patients from being terminally ill to being in complete remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the approach is highly specific and works in only a limited number of cancers where there is a clear target to train the T-cells to spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has struggled to have any success in &quot;solid cancers&quot; - those that form tumours rather than blood cancers such as leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say their T-cell receptor could lead to a &quot;universal&quot; cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;So how would it work in practice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that a blood sample would be taken from a cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their T-cells would be extracted and then genetically modified so they were reprogrammed to make the cancer-finding receptor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upgraded cells would be grown in vast quantities in the laboratory and then put back into the patient. It is the same process used to make CAR-T therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research has been tested only in animals and on cells in the laboratory, and more safety checks would be needed before human trials could start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What do the experts say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucia Mori and Gennaro De Libero, from University of Basel in Switzerland, said the research had &quot;great potential&quot; but was at too early a stage to say it would work in all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are very excited about the immunological functions of this new T-cell population and the potential use of their TCRs in tumour cell therapy,&quot; they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Davis, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, said: &quot;At the moment, this is very basic research and not close to actual medicines for patients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no question that it's a very exciting discovery, both for advancing our basic knowledge about the immune system and for the possibility of future new medicines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow James on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/JamesTGallagher&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Twitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Corrupt a SQLite Database File</title>
<link>https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;nosearch&quot; readability=&quot;0.33832539142274&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Corrupt An SQLite Database File&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 notoc=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SQLite database is highly resistant to corruption. If an application crash, or an operating-system crash, or even a power failure occurs in the middle of a transaction, the partially written transaction should be automatically rolled back the next time the database file is accessed. The recovery process is fully automatic and does not require any action on the part of the user or the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though SQLite is resistant to database corruption, it is not immune. This document describes the various ways that an SQLite database might go corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLite database files are ordinary disk files. That means that any process can open the file and overwrite it with garbage. There is nothing that the SQLite library can do to defend against this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_continuing_to_use_a_file_descriptor_after_it_has_been_closed&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.1.&lt;/span&gt; Continuing to use a file descriptor after it has been closed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen multiple cases where a file descriptor was open on a file, then that file descriptor was closed and reopened on an SQLite database. Later, some other thread continued to write into the old file descriptor, not realizing that the original file had been closed already. But because the file descriptor had been reopened by SQLite, the information that was intended to go into the original file ended up overwriting parts of the SQLite database, leading to corruption of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of this occurred circa 2013-08-30 on the canonical repository for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fossil-scm.org/&quot;&gt;Fossil DVCS&lt;/a&gt;. In that event, file descriptor 2 (standard error) was being erroneously closed (by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stunnel.org/&quot;&gt;stunnel&lt;/a&gt;, we suspect) prior to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html&quot;&gt;sqlite3_open_v2()&lt;/a&gt; so that the file descriptor used for the repository database file was 2. Later, an application bug caused an assert() statement to emit an error message by invoking write(2,...). But since file descriptor 2 was now connected to a database file, the error message overwrote part of the database. To guard against this kind of problem, SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_8_1.html&quot;&gt;version 3.8.1&lt;/a&gt; (2013-10-17) and later refuse to use low-numbered file descriptors for database files. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#minimum_file_descriptor&quot;&gt;SQLITE_MINIMUM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of corruption caused by using a closed file descriptor was &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.facebook.com/posts/313033472212144/debugging-file-corruption-on-ios/&quot;&gt;reported by facebook engineers&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post on 2014-08-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this error was reported against &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/&quot;&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt; on 2019-07-11. A file descriptor would be opened for debugging output, but then closed and reopened by SQLite. But the debugging logic continued to write into the original file descriptor. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/forum/forumpost/c51b9a1169&quot;&gt;forum discussion&lt;/a&gt; for the bug report and a link to the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_backup_or_restore_while_a_transaction_is_active&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.2.&lt;/span&gt; Backup or restore while a transaction is active&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems that run automatic backups in the background might try to make a backup copy of an SQLite database file while it is in the middle of a transaction. The backup copy then might contain some old and some new content, and thus be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach to make reliable backup copies of an SQLite database is to make use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html&quot;&gt;backup API&lt;/a&gt; that is part of the SQLite library. Failing that, it is safe to make a copy of an SQLite database file as long as there are no transactions in progress by any process. If the previous transaction failed, then it is important that any rollback journal (the &lt;tt&gt;*-journal&lt;/tt&gt; file) or write-ahead log (the &lt;tt&gt;*-wal&lt;/tt&gt; file) be copied together with the database file itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_deleting_a_hot_journal&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.3.&lt;/span&gt; Deleting a hot journal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite normally stores all content in a single disk file. However, while performing a transaction, information necessary to recover the database following a crash or power failure is stored in auxiliary journal files. Such journal files are described as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#hotjrnl&quot;&gt;&quot;hot&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. The journal files have the same name as the original database file with the addition of &lt;tt&gt;-journal&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-wal&lt;/tt&gt; suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite must see the journal files in order to recover from a crash or power failure. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#hotjrnl&quot;&gt;hot journal files&lt;/a&gt; are moved, deleted, or renamed after a crash or power failure, then automatic recovery will not work and the database may go corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another manifestation of this problem is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/shortnames.html#db83corrupt&quot;&gt;database corruption caused by inconsistent use of 8+3 filenames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_mispairing_database_files_and_hot_journals_&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.4.&lt;/span&gt; Mispairing database files and hot journals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous example is a specific case of a more general problem: The state of an SQLite database is controlled by both the database file and the journal file. In a quiescent state, the journal file does not exist and only the database file matters. But if the journal file does exist, it must be kept together with the database to avoid corruption. The following actions are all likely to lead to corruption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swapping journal files between two different databases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overwritting a journal file with a different journal file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving a journal file from one database to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copying a database file without also copying its journal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overwriting a database file with another without also deleting any hot journal associated with the original database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite uses file locks on the database file, and on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;write-ahead log&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL&lt;/a&gt; file, to coordinate access between concurrent processes. Without coordination, two threads or processes might try to make incompatible changes to a database file at the same time, resulting in database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_filesystems_with_broken_or_missing_lock_implementations&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.1.&lt;/span&gt; Filesystems with broken or missing lock implementations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite depends on the underlying filesystem to do locking as the documentation says it will. But some filesystems contain bugs in their locking logic such that the locks do not always behave as advertised. This is especially true of network filesystems and NFS in particular. If SQLite is used on a filesystem where the locking primitives contain bugs, and if two or more threads or processes try to access the same database at the same time, then database corruption might result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_posix_advisory_locks_canceled_by_a_separate_thread_doing_close_&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.2.&lt;/span&gt; Posix advisory locks canceled by a separate thread doing close()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default locking mechanism used by SQLite on unix platforms is POSIX advisory locking. Unfortunately, POSIX advisory locking has design quirks that make it prone to misuse and failure. In particular, any thread in the same process with a file descriptor that is holding a POSIX advisory lock can override that lock using a different file descriptor. One particularly pernicious problem is that the &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; system call will cancel all POSIX advisory locks on the same file for all threads and all file descriptors in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, suppose a multi-thread process has two or more threads with separate SQLite database connections to the same database file. Then a third thread comes along and wants to read something out of that same database file on its own, without using the SQLite library. The third thread does an &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt;, a &lt;tt&gt;read()&lt;/tt&gt; and then a &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt;. One would think this would be harmless. But the &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; system call caused the locks held on the database by all the other threads to be dropped. Those other threads have no way of knowing that their locks have just been trashed (POSIX does not provide any mechanism to determine this) and so they keep on running under the assumption that their locks are still valid. This can lead to two or more threads or processes trying to write to the database at the same time, resulting in database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is perfectly safe for two or more threads to access the same SQLite database file using the SQLite library. The unix drivers for SQLite know about the POSIX advisory locking quirks and work around them. This problem only arises when a thread tries to bypass the SQLite library and read the database file directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple_copies_of_sqlite_linked_into_the_same_application&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.2.1.&lt;/span&gt; Multiple copies of SQLite linked into the same application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in the previous paragraph, SQLite takes steps to work around the quirks of POSIX advisory locking. Part of that work-around involves keeping a global list (mutex protected) of open SQLite database files. But, if multiple copies of SQLite are linked into the same application, then there will be multiple instances of this global list. Database connections opened using one copy of the SQLite library will be unaware of database connections opened using the other copy, and will be unable to work around the POSIX advisory locking quirks. A &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; operation on one connection might unknowingly clear the locks on a different database connection, leading to database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario above sounds far-fetched. But the SQLite developers are aware of at least one commercial product that was released with exactly this bug. The vendor came to the SQLite developers seeking help in tracking down some infrequent database corruption issues they were seeing on Linux and Mac. The problem was eventually traced to the fact that the application was linking against two separate copies of SQLite. The solution was to change the application build procedures to link against just one copy of SQLite instead of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_two_processes_using_different_locking_protocols&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.3.&lt;/span&gt; Two processes using different locking protocols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default locking mechanism used by SQLite on unix platforms is POSIX advisory locking, but there are other options. By selecting an alternative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/vfs.html&quot;&gt;sqlite3_vfs&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html&quot;&gt;sqlite3_open_v2()&lt;/a&gt; interface, an application can make use of other locking protocols that might be more appropriate to certain filesystems. For example, dot-file locking might be select for use in an application that has to run on an NFS filesystem that does not support POSIX advisory locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that all connections to the same database file use the same locking protocol. If one application is using POSIX advisory locks and another application is using dot-file locking, then the two applications will not see each other's locks and will not be able to coordinate database access, possibly leading to database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_unlinking_or_renaming_a_database_file_while_in_use&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.4.&lt;/span&gt; Unlinking or renaming a database file while in use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two processes have open connections to the same database file and one process closes its connection, unlinks the file, then creates a new database file in its place with the same name and reopens the new file, then the two processes will be talking to different database files with the same name. (Note that this is only possible on Posix and Posix-like systems that permit a file to be unlinked while it is still open for reading and writing. Windows does not allow this to occur.) Since rollback journals and WAL files are based on the name of the database file, the two different database files will share the same rollback journal or WAL file. A rollback or recovery for one of the databases might use content from the other database, resulting in corruption. A similar problem occurs if a database file is renamed while it is opened and a new file is created with the old name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, unlinking or renaming an open database file results in behavior that is undefined and probably undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_17.html&quot;&gt;version 3.7.17&lt;/a&gt; (2013-05-20), the unix OS interface will send SQLITE_WARNING messages to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/errlog.html&quot;&gt;error log&lt;/a&gt; if a database file is unlinked while it is still in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_multiple_links_to_the_same_file&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.5.&lt;/span&gt; Multiple links to the same file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a single database file has multiple links (either hard or soft links) then that is just another way of saying that the file has multiple names. If two or more processes open the database using different names, then they will use different rollback journals and WAL files. That means that if one process crashes, the other process will be unable to recover the transaction in progress because it will be looking in the wrong place for the appropriate journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, opening and using a database file that has two or more names results in behavior that is undefined and probably undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_17.html&quot;&gt;version 3.7.17&lt;/a&gt; (2013-05-20), the unix OS interface will send SQLITE_WARNING messages to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/errlog.html&quot;&gt;error log&lt;/a&gt; if a database file has multiple hard links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_10_0.html&quot;&gt;version 3.10.0&lt;/a&gt; (2016-01-06), the unix OS interface will attempt to resolve symbolic links and open the database file by its canonical name. Prior to version 3.10.0, opening a database file through a symbolic link was similar to opening a database file that had multiple hard links and resulted in undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_carrying_an_open_database_connection_across_a_fork_&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.6.&lt;/span&gt; Carrying an open database connection across a fork()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not open an SQLite database connection, then fork(), then try to use that database connection in the child process. All kinds of locking problems will result and you can easily end up with a corrupt database. SQLite is not designed to support that kind of behavior. Any database connection that is used in a child process must be opened in the child process, not inherited from the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not even call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/close.html&quot;&gt;sqlite3_close()&lt;/a&gt; on a database connection from a child process if the connection was opened in the parent. It is safe to close the underlying file descriptor, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/close.html&quot;&gt;sqlite3_close()&lt;/a&gt; interface might invoke cleanup activities that will delete content out from under the parent, leading to errors and perhaps even database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to guarantee that database files are always consistent, SQLite will occasionally ask the operating system to flush all pending writes to persistent storage then wait for that flush to complete. This is accomplished using the &lt;tt&gt;fsync()&lt;/tt&gt; system call under unix and &lt;tt&gt;FlushFileBuffers()&lt;/tt&gt; under Windows. We call this flush of pending writes a &quot;sync&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if one is only concerned with atomic and consistent writes and is willing to forego durable writes, the sync operation does not need to wait until the content is completely stored on persistent media. Instead, the sync operation can be thought of as an I/O barrier. As long as all writes that occur before the sync are completed before any write that happens after the sync, no database corruption will occur. If sync is operating as an I/O barrier and not as a true sync, then a power failure or system crash might cause one or more previously committed transactions to roll back (in violation of the &quot;durable&quot; property of &quot;ACID&quot;) but the database will at least continue to be consistent, and that is what most people care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_disk_drives_that_do_not_honor_sync_requests&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.1.&lt;/span&gt; Disk drives that do not honor sync requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most consumer-grade mass storage devices lie about syncing. Disk drives will report that content is safely on persistent media as soon as it reaches the track buffer and before actually being written to oxide. This makes the disk drives seem to operate faster (which is vitally important to the manufacturer so that they can show good benchmark numbers in trade magazines). And in fairness, the lie normally causes no harm, as long as there is no power loss or hard reset prior to the track buffer actually being written to oxide. But if a power loss or hard reset does occur, and if that results in content that was written after a sync reaching oxide while content written before the sync is still in a track buffer, then database corruption can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB flash memory sticks seem to be especially pernicious liars regarding sync requests. One can easily see this by committing a large transaction to an SQLite database on a USB memory stick. The COMMIT command will return relatively quickly, indicating that the memory stick has told the operating system and the operating system has told SQLite that all content is safely in persistent storage, and yet the LED on the end of the memory stick will continue flashing for several more seconds. Pulling out the memory stick while the LED is still flashing will frequently result in database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that SQLite must believe whatever the operating system and hardware tell it about the status of sync requests. There is no way for SQLite to detect that either is lying and that writes might be occurring out-of-order. However, SQLite in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL mode&lt;/a&gt; is far more forgiving of out-of-order writes than in the default rollback journal modes. In WAL mode, the only time that a failed sync operation can cause database corruption is during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html#ckpt&quot;&gt;checkpoint&lt;/a&gt; operation. A sync failure during a COMMIT might result in loss of durability but not in a corrupt database file. Hence, one line of defense against database corruption due to failed sync operations is to use SQLite in WAL mode and to checkpoint as infrequently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_disabling_sync_using_pragmas&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.2.&lt;/span&gt; Disabling sync using PRAGMAs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sync operations that SQLite performs to help ensure integrity can be disabled at run-time using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous&quot;&gt;synchronous pragma&lt;/a&gt;. By setting PRAGMA synchronous=OFF, all sync operations are omitted. This makes SQLite seem to run faster, but it also allows the operating system to freely reorder writes, which could result in database corruption if a power failure or hard reset occurs prior to all content reaching persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For maximum reliability and for robustness against database corruption, SQLite should always be run with its default synchronous setting of FULL.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An SQLite database can become corrupt if the file content changes due to a disk drive or flash memory failure. It is very rare, but disks will occasionally flip a bit in the middle of a sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_non_powersafe_flash_memory_controllers&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.1.&lt;/span&gt; Non-powersafe flash memory controllers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are told that in some flash memory controllers the wear-leveling logic can cause random filesystem damage if power is interrupted during a write. This can manifest, for example, as random changes in the middle of a file that was not even open at the time of the power loss. So, for example, a device would be writing content into an MP3 file in flash memory when a power loss occurs, and that could result in an SQLite database being corrupted even though the database was not even in use at the time of the power loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;_fake_capacity_usb_sticks&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.2.&lt;/span&gt; Fake capacity USB sticks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many fraudulent USB sticks in circulation that report to have a high capacity (ex: 8GB) but are really only capable of storing a much smaller amount (ex: 1GB). Attempts to write on these devices will often result in unrelated files being overwritten. Any use of a fraudulent flash memory device can easily lead to database corruption, therefore. Internet searches such as &quot;fake capacity usb&quot; will turn up lots of disturbing information about this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLite is a C-library that runs in the same address space as the application that it serves. That means that stray pointers, buffer overruns, heap corruption, or other malfunctions in the application can corrupt internal SQLite data structure and ultimately result in a corrupt database file. Normally these kinds of problems manifest themselves as segfaults prior to any database corruption occurring, but there have been instances where application code errors have caused SQLite to malfunction subtly so as to corrupt the database file rather than panicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory corruption problem becomes more acute when using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/mmap.html&quot;&gt;memory-mapped I/O&lt;/a&gt;. When all or part of the database file is mapped into the application's address space, then a stray pointer that overwrites any part of that mapped space will immediately corrupt the database file, without requiring the application to do a subsequent write() system call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes operating systems will exhibit non-standard behavior which can lead to problems. Sometimes this non-standard behavior is deliberate, and sometimes it is a mistake in the implementation. But in any event, if the operating performs differently from they way SQLite expects it to perform, the possibility of database corruption exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_linux_threads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.1.&lt;/span&gt; Linux Threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some older versions of Linux used the LinuxThreads library for thread support. LinuxThreads is similar to Pthreads, but is subtly different with respect to handling of POSIX advisory locks. SQLite versions 2.2.3 through 3.6.23 recognized that LinuxThreads were being used at runtime and took appropriate action to work around the non-standard behavior of LinuxThreads. But most modern Linux implementations make use of the newer, and correct, NPTL implementation of Pthreads. Beginning with SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_0.html&quot;&gt;version 3.7.0&lt;/a&gt; (2010-07-21), the use of NPTL is assumed. No checks are made. Hence, recent versions of SQLite will subtly malfunction and may corrupt database files if used in multi-threaded application that run on older linux systems that make use of LinuxThreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_failures_of_mmap_on_qnx&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.2.&lt;/span&gt; Failures of mmap() on QNX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists some subtle problem with mmap() on QNX such that making a second mmap() call against a single file descriptor can cause the memory obtained from the first mmap() call to be zeroed. SQLite on unix uses mmap() to create a shared memory region for transaction coordination in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL mode&lt;/a&gt;, and it will call mmap() multiple times for large transactions. The QNX mmap() has been demonstrated to corrupt database file under that scenario. QNX engineers are aware of this problem and are working on a solution; the problem may have already been fixed by the time you read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running on QNX, it is recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/mmap.html&quot;&gt;memory-mapped I/O&lt;/a&gt; never be used. Furthermore, to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL mode&lt;/a&gt;, it is recommended that applications employ the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode&quot;&gt;exclusive locking mode&lt;/a&gt; in order to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html#noshm&quot;&gt;WAL without shared memory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_filesystem_corruption&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.3.&lt;/span&gt; Filesystem Corruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since SQLite databases are ordinary disk files, any malfunction in the filesystem can corrupt the database. Filesystems in modern operating systems are very reliable, but errors do still occur. For example, on 2013-10-01 the SQLite database that holds the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.tcl-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Wiki for Tcl/Tk&lt;/a&gt; went corrupt a few days after the host computer was moved to a dodgy build of the (linux) kernel that had issues in the filesystem layer. In that event, the filesystem eventually became so badly corrupted that the machine was unusable, but the earliest symptom of trouble was the corrupted SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;SQLite has many built-in protections against database corruption. But many of these protections can be disabled by configuration options. If protections are disabled, database corruption may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are examples of disabling the built-in protection mechanisms of SQLite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLite is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html&quot;&gt;very carefully tested&lt;/a&gt; to help ensure that it is as bug-free as possible. Among the many tests that are carried out for every SQLite version are tests that simulate power failures, I/O errors, and out-of-memory (OOM) errors and verify that no database corrupt occurs during any of these events. SQLite is also field-proven with approximately two billion active deployments with no serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no software is 100% perfect. There have been a few historical bugs in SQLite (now fixed) that could cause database corruption. And there may be yet a few more that remain undiscovered. Because of the extensive testing and widespread use of SQLite, bugs that result in database corruption tend to be very obscure. The likelihood of an application encountering an SQLite bug is small. To illustrate this, an account is given below of all database-corruption bugs found in SQLite during the four-year period from 2009-04-01 to 2013-04-15. This account should give the reader an intuitive sense of the kinds of bugs in SQLite that manage to slip through testing procedures and make it into a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_false_corruption_reports_due_to_database_shrinkage&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.1.&lt;/span&gt; False corruption reports due to database shrinkage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a database is written by SQLite version 3.7.0 or later and then written again by SQLite version 3.6.23 or earlier in such a way as to make the size of the database file decrease, then the next time that SQLite version 3.7.0 access the database file, it might report that the database file is corrupt. The database file is not really corrupt, however. Version 3.7.0 was simply being overly zealous in its corruption detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was fixed on 2011-02-20. The fix first appears in SQLite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_6.html&quot;&gt;version 3.7.6&lt;/a&gt; (2011-04-12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_corruption_following_switches_between_rollback_and_wal_modes&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.2.&lt;/span&gt; Corruption following switches between rollback and WAL modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly switching an SQLite database in and out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL mode&lt;/a&gt; and running the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html&quot;&gt;VACUUM&lt;/a&gt; command in between switches, in one process or thread, can cause another process or thread that has the database file open to miss the fact that the database has changed. That second process or thread might then try to modify the database using a stale cache and cause database corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was discovered during internal testing and has never been observed in the wild. The problem was fixed on 2011-01-27 and in version 3.7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_i_o_error_while_obtaining_a_lock_leads_to_corruption&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.3.&lt;/span&gt; I/O error while obtaining a lock leads to corruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the operating system returns an I/O error while attempting to obtain a certain lock on shared memory in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL mode&lt;/a&gt; then SQLite might fail to reset its cache, which could lead to database corruption if subsequent writes are attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this problem only occurs if the attempt to acquire the lock resulted in an I/O error. If the lock is simply not granted (because some other thread or process is already holding a conflicting lock) then no corruption will ever occur. We are not aware of any operating systems that will fail with an I/O error while attempting to get a file lock on shared memory. So this is a theoretical problem rather than a real problem. Needless to say, this problem has never been observed in the wild. The problem was discovered while doing stress testing of SQLite in a test harness that simulates I/O errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was fixed on 2010-09-20 for SQLite version 3.7.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_database_pages_leak_from_the_free_page_list&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.4.&lt;/span&gt; Database pages leak from the free page list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When content is deleted from an SQLite database, pages that are no longer used are added to a free list and are reused to hold content added by subsequent inserts. A bug in SQLite that was present in version 3.6.16 through 3.7.2 might cause pages to go missing out of the free list when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum&quot;&gt;incremental_vacuum&lt;/a&gt; was used. This would not cause data loss. But it would result in the database file being larger than necessary. And it would cause the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check&quot;&gt;integrity_check pragma&lt;/a&gt; to report pages missing from the free list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was fixed on 2010-08-23 for SQLite version 3.7.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_corruption_following_alternating_writes_from_3_6_and_3_7_&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.5.&lt;/span&gt; Corruption following alternating writes from 3.6 and 3.7.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite version 3.7.0 introduced a number of new enhancements to the SQLite database file format (such as but not limited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&quot;&gt;WAL&lt;/a&gt;). The 3.7.0 release was a shake-out release for these new features. We expected to find problems and were not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a database were originally created using SQLite version 3.7.0, then written by SQLite version 3.6.23.1 such that the size of the database file increased, then written again by SQLite version 3.7.0, the database file could go corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was fixed on 2010-08-04 for SQLite version 3.7.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_race_condition_in_recovery_on_windows_system_&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.6.&lt;/span&gt; Race condition in recovery on windows system.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite version 3.7.16.2 fixes a subtle race condition in the locking logic on Windows systems. When a database file is in need of recovery because the previous process writing to it crashed in the middle of a transaction and two or more processes try to open the that database at the same time, then the race condition might cause one of those processes to get a false indication that the recovery has already completed, allowing that process to continue using the database file without running recovery first. If that process writes to the file, then the file might go corrupt. This race condition had apparently existed in all prior versions of SQLite for Windows going back to 2004. But the race was very tight. Practically speaking, you need a fast multi-core machine in which you launch two processes to run recovery at the same moment on two separate cores. This defect was on Windows systems only and did not affect the posix OS interface.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thank HN: My SaaS paid my rent this month</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22098425</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22098425</guid>
<description>Running a profitable SAAS has been my dream from the moment I wrote my first line of code.
&lt;p&gt;Here on HN and IndieHackers I've always looked up to the people who pay their bills with recurring revenue from their tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried, many times, to do the same, without much success. A couple of rather successful HN pitches, but none of my projects ever even paid me a beer (let alone my rent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this month! Last year I built myself and my girlfriend a tool. Even though I did build it for other people to use it, I had never thought someone actually would. Long story short, half a year later I provide my service to more than 5000 (fully organic) users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month is the first month in which revenue is high enough to pay my rent with it. Disclaimer: I share my rent with my girlfriend, but it does sound cool to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the proces, it does match with a lot of other success stories I read over the years in the HN community. The main lesson which I can now confirm: build something that scratches your own itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... Thanks you guys, for keeping me motivated and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proteins perform or catalyse nearly all chemical and mechanical processes in cells. Synthesized as linear chains of amino-acid residues, most proteins spontaneously fold into one or a small number of favoured three-dimensional structures. The sequence of amino acids specifies a protein’s structure and range of motion, which in turn determine its function. Over decades, structural biologists have experimentally determined thousands of protein structures, but the difficulty of these studies has made the promise of a computational approach for predicting protein structure from sequence alluring. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Senior &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; describe an algorithm, AlphaFold, that takes a leap forward in solving this classic problem by bringing to bear modern machine-learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diversity of protein structures precludes the possibility of obtaining simple folding rules, making structure prediction difficult. Protein folding is ultimately driven by quantum mechanics. Were it possible to compute the exact energy of protein molecules from quantum theory, and to do so for every possible conformation, then predicting a protein’s most energetically favoured structure would be easy. Unfortunately, a quantum treatment of proteins is computationally intractable (quantum computers might change this), and the total set of possible conformations that any protein can take is astronomical, prohibiting such a brute-force approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not stopped scientists from attempting a direct attack on the problem. Physical chemists have devised tractable, but approximate, energy models for proteins&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and computer scientists have developed ways to explore protein conformations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR3&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Much progress has been made on the first problem but the second has proved more recalcitrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of shapes that a protein might take can be likened to a landscape: different locations in the landscape correspond to different shapes, with nearby locations having similar shapes. The height of a location corresponds to how energetically favourable the associated shape is, with the lowest point being the most favoured. Natural proteins evolved to have funnel-shaped landscapes that enable newly synthesized proteins, jostled by the thermal fluctuations of the cell, to cross the landscape and find their way to a favoured conformation in physiologically relevant timescales (milliseconds to minutes)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR4&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Algorithms can search the landscape to find favoured conformations by following the landscape’s inclination, but the ruggedness of the terrain causes them to get stuck in troughs and valleys far from the lowest basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course of the structure-prediction field changed nearly a decade ago with the publication of a series of seminal papers&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR5&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR7&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; exploring the idea that the evolutionary record contains clues about how proteins fold. The idea is predicated on the following premise: if two amino-acid residues in a protein are close together in 3D space, then a mutation that replaces one of them with a different residue (for example, large for small) will probably induce, at a later time, a mutation that alters the other residue in a compensatory direction (in our example, swapping small for large). The set of co-evolving residues therefore encodes valuable spatial information, and can be found by analysing the sequences of evolutionarily related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By transforming this co-evolutionary information into a matrix known as a binary contact map, which encodes which residues are proximal, the set of conformations that merit consideration by algorithmic searches can be restricted. This in turn makes it possible to accurately predict the most favourable protein conformation, especially for proteins for which many evolutionarily related sequences are known. The idea was not new&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR8&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but the rapid growth in available sequence data in the early 2010s, coupled with crucial algorithmic breakthroughs, meant that its time had finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-evolutionary analysis has been responsible for most progress in protein-structure prediction in the past few years, but it has not obviated the need for algorithms to search the energy landscapes of proteins: binary contact maps constrain the search space, but do not pin down a single 3D structure. Furthermore, the mathematics underpinning the conversion of co-evolutionary data into contact maps is restricted by the types of input used and the output generated. The initial injection of deep learning (a type of machine learning) into co-evolutionary analyses improved matters by incorporating richer inputs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR9&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. AlphaFold takes things a step further by changing the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07883-z&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-019-03951-0/d41586-019-03951-0_16690736.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of binary contact data, AlphaFold predicts the probabilities of residues being separated by different distances. Because probabilities and energies are interconvertible, AlphaFold predicts an energy landscape — one that overlaps in its lowest basin with the true landscape, but is much smoother. In fact, AlphaFold’s landscape is so smooth that it nearly eliminates the need for searching. This makes it possible to use a simple procedure to find the most favourable conformation, rather than the complex search algorithms employed by other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a complex search could be unnecessary for structure prediction is, in hindsight, unsurprising. Mathematically, the distances between points determine their relative locations. Predictions of distances can therefore predict structure. Moreover, relatively simple models of protein energy landscapes known as Gō potentials, in which experimentally determined distances between residues are favoured, can lead to protein-folding pathways that resemble ones experienced by real proteins&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR10&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This suggests that proteins fold more like simple origami than like an intricate knot — all parts can come together at once. My own work has shown that folding can be predicted implicitly using a deep-learning model without searching&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR11&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and minimal search procedures have also been embedded within another deep-learning model to predict protein structures&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR12&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is notable about AlphaFold is that it predicts distances with sufficient accuracy to outperform state-of-the-art search methods (Fig. 1). Senior &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; used advances in deep learning to extract as much structural information as possible from protein sequences. The resulting algorithm outperformed all entrants at the most recent blind assessment of methods used to predict protein structures (the CASP13 event), generating the best structure for 25 out of 43 proteins, compared with 3 out of 43 for the next-best method. AlphaFold’s predictions had a median accuracy of 6.6 ångströms on this set of proteins — that is, for the middle-ranked protein in this set, the atoms in the proposed structures were on average 6.6 Å away from their actual positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mr10&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 | Predictions of protein structures.&lt;/strong&gt; Senior &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03951-0#ref-CR1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; report a machine-learning system called AlphaFold, which predicts the 3D structures of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Template modelling (TM) scores measure how well a predicted structure matches the overall shape of the actual structure, on a scale from 0 to 1. TM scores for AlphaFold were better than those of other prediction systems for 25 out of 43 proteins in a blind test. Here, the TM scores for AlphaFold (red) are compared with those of other prediction systems (grey) in the blind test for six proteins whose 3D structures could be modelled only on the basis of their amino-acid sequences — no 3D structures of proteins that have similar amino-acid sequences were available to use as a starting point for modelling. AlphaFold made the most accurate predictions for five of these six proteins. (Adapted from Fig. 1b of ref. 1.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges remain. AlphaFold is not yet accurate enough for most applications, such as working out the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes or how drugs bind to proteins (which both typically require 2–3 Å resolution). And although AlphaFold’s search procedure is much simpler than most modern methods, it can still be slow, taking tens to hundreds of hours to make a single prediction. For applications such as protein design, which require the structures of many different protein sequences to be modelled, the lack of speed is an impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this is a watershed moment for the field. Given continued growth in the number of available protein sequences, it is possible that the coarse structures (about 4 Å resolution) of most proteins that consist of a single folded domain will become available in the next five years from structure predictions. Such broad availability of structural information might transform the life sciences, just as sequence information did in the preceding decades. This could mean that, combined with the rapid advances in protein–structure determination enabled by cryo-electron microscopy, we are entering a golden age of structural biology — one that makes possible a quantitative and mechanistic basis for the life sciences, broadly grounded in firm structural hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bruce Schneier: Banning Facial Recognition Isn’t Enough</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Communities across the United States are starting to ban facial recognition technologies. In May of last year, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; banned facial recognition; the neighboring city of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmpaex/oakland-becomes-third-us-city-to-ban-facial-recognition-xz&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt; soon followed, as did &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/27/somerville-city-council-passes-facial-recognition-ban/SfaqQ7mG3DGulXonBHSCYK/story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Somerville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/12/12/brookline-facial-recognition&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brookline&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts (a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclum.org/en/news/massachusetts-voters-strongly-support-pausing-use-unregulated-face-recognition-technology&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statewide ban&lt;/a&gt; may follow). In December, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90440198/san-diegos-massive-7-year-experiment-with-facial-recognition-technology-appears-to-be-a-flop&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; suspended a facial recognition program in advance of a new statewide law, which declared it illegal, coming into effect. Forty major music festivals &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywakpj/40-major-music-festivals-have-pledged-not-to-use-facial-recognition-technology&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; not to use the technology, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; are calling for a nationwide ban. Many Democratic presidential candidates &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/3/20965470/2020-presidential-candidates-facial-recognition&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;support at least a partial ban&lt;/a&gt; on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These efforts are well intentioned, but facial recognition bans are the wrong way to fight against modern surveillance. Focusing on one particular identification method misconstrues the nature of the surveillance society we’re in the process of building. Ubiquitous mass surveillance is increasingly the norm. In countries like China, a surveillance infrastructure is being built by the government for social control. In countries like the United States, it’s being built by corporations in order to influence our buying behavior, and is incidentally used by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In all cases, modern mass surveillance has three broad components: identification, correlation and discrimination. Let’s take them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facial recognition is a technology that can be used to identify people without their knowledge or consent. It relies on the prevalence of cameras, which are becoming both more powerful and smaller, and machine learning technologies that can match the output of these cameras with images from a database of existing photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But that’s just one identification technology among many. People can be identified at a distance by their &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613891/the-pentagon-has-a-laser-that-can-identify-people-from-a-distanceby-their-heartbeat/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart beat&lt;/a&gt; or by their &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.watrix.ai/en/gait-recognition/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gait&lt;/a&gt;, using a laser-based system. Cameras are so good that they can read &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/422400/fingerprints-go-the-distance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fingerprints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/05/long-range-iris-scanning-is-here/393065/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;/&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/05/long-range-iris-scanning-is-here/393065/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; from meters away. And even without any of these technologies, we can always be identified because our smartphones &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/196998/your-devices-broadcast-unique-numbers-and-theyre-being-used-to-track-you/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;broadcast&lt;/a&gt; unique numbers called MAC addresses. Other things identify us as well: our phone numbers, our credit card numbers, the license plates on our cars. China, for example, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;uses multiple identification technologies&lt;/a&gt; to support its surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Once we are identified, the data about who we are and what we are doing can be correlated with other data collected at other times. This might be movement data, which can be used to “follow” us as we move throughout our day. It can be purchasing data, internet browsing data, or data about who we talk to via email or text. It might be data about our income, ethnicity, lifestyle, profession and interests. There is an entire industry of data brokers who make a living analyzing and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;augmenting data&lt;/a&gt; about who we are — using surveillance data collected by all sorts of companies and then sold without our knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There is a huge — and almost entirely unregulated — data broker industry in the United States that trades on our information. This is how large internet companies like Google and Facebook make their money. It’s not just that they know who we are, it’s that they correlate what they know about us to create profiles about who we are and what our interests are. This is why many companies &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43kxzq/dmvs-selling-data-private-investigators-making-millions-of-dollars&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buy license plate data&lt;/a&gt; from states. It’s also why companies &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/google-ascension-health-data.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;like Google&lt;/a&gt; are buying health records, and part of the reason Google &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/11/02/google-to-buy-fitbit-for-21-billion-what-about-privacy-concerns/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bought the company Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, along with all of its data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The whole purpose of this process is for companies — and governments — to treat individuals differently. We are shown different ads on the internet and receive different offers for credit cards. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-10/google-s-targeted-ads-are-coming-to-a-billboard-near-you&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smart billboards&lt;/a&gt; display different advertisements based on who we are. In the future, we might be treated differently when we walk into a store, just as we currently are when we visit websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The point is that it doesn’t matter which technology is used to identify people. That there currently is no comprehensive database of heart beats or gaits doesn’t make the technologies that gather them any less effective. And most of the time, it doesn’t matter if identification isn’t tied to a real name. What’s important is that we can be consistently identified over time. We might be completely anonymous in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://privacy.net/stop-cookies-tracking/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;system that uses unique cookies&lt;/a&gt; to track us as we browse the internet, but the same process of correlation and discrimination still occurs. It’s the same with faces; we can be tracked as we move around a store or shopping mall, even if that tracking isn’t tied to a specific name. And that anonymity is fragile: If we ever order something online with a credit card, or purchase something with a credit card in a store, then suddenly our real names are attached to what was anonymous tracking information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Regulating this system means addressing all three steps of the process. A ban on facial recognition won’t make any difference if, in response, surveillance systems switch to identifying people by smartphone MAC addresses. The problem is that we are being identified without our knowledge or consent, and society needs rules about when that is permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Similarly, we need rules about how our data can be combined with other data, and then bought and sold without our knowledge or consent. The data broker industry is almost entirely unregulated; there’s only one law — passed in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90302036/over-120-data-brokers-inch-out-of-the-shadows-under-landmark-vermont-law&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 — that requires data brokers to register and explain in broad terms what kind of data they collect. The large internet surveillance companies like Facebook and Google collect dossiers on us more detailed than those of any police state of the previous century. Reasonable laws would prevent the worst of their abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, we need better rules about when and how it is permissible for companies to discriminate. Discrimination based on protected characteristics like race and gender is already illegal, but those rules are ineffectual against the current technologies of surveillance and control. When people can be identified and their data correlated at a speed and scale previously unseen, we need new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today, facial recognition technologies are receiving the brunt of the tech backlash, but focusing on them misses the point. We need to have a serious conversation about all the technologies of identification, correlation and discrimination, and decide how much we as a society want to be spied on by governments and corporations — and what sorts of influence we want them to have over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-jwz2nf etfikam0&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier is a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author, most recently, of “Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-Connected World.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;In the last year or so I've tried to make an effort to email people who have had some sort of positive impact on me. I specifically choose email because to me it feels more personal than a tweet or some other equivalent.
&lt;p&gt;I've emailed quite a few people and have been very surprised at the 100% reply rate I've received and in some instances, the conversations that have developed from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emails are usually very short, personalised messages along the lines of &quot;Hi X, thank you very much for Y. It had a positive impact on me because of Z. All the best&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the people include small to medium sized musicians, authors, developers, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of feel like a bit of a weirdo doing it because I don't really hear of many people who do the same. But sometimes I just genuinely want to thank a person for what they've contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a large main light, a smaller light on top that faces up, several levels of brightness, and a fan. Each time I tried to turn off the upward facing light, something else would turn on. After ten minutes, I woke up my wife to ask her to help. It only got worse.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>BMW Connected Apps Protocol</title>
<link>https://hufman.github.io/stories/bmwconnectedapps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hufman.github.io/stories/bmwconnectedapps</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a BMW joined my household, and I had my first taste of IDrive and BMW Connected Apps. Through some magic Bluetooth protocol, Spotify on my phone would be added to the list of music sources in the dashboard. Clicking into this entry showed a rich user interface, offering browse options to select playlists and to start radio stations based on the current song, far more interactive than the basic Bluetooth music controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/spotify.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/spotify.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spotify App&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;excitement&quot;&gt;Excitement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immediately ignited excitement for the possibilities! Instead of being stuck with what apps are loaded on the car at time of manufacturer, the car can automatically be upgraded as support is added to the respective phone apps. Instead of needing to take my phone out of my pocket and stare down at the phone screen to switch music, I can use the tactile controller knob with the infotainment screen to safely control any app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/allapps.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/allapps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Other Available Apps&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;glitchy&quot;&gt;Glitchy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as is normal with Bluetooth, the experience was not very smooth. Sometimes the additional Bluetooth Apps protocol wouldn't connect, and sometimes the individual apps themselves wouldn't be responsive. Cries for help on the Spotify forums were ignored, and the BMW Connected app has terrible reviews with no signs of fixing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-apps&quot;&gt;Other Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, BMW Connected for Android only shared a very limited selection of apps, compared to the available apps on iPhone: only Spotify and iHeartRadio, along with a basic Calendar app. Since I enjoy other music apps, I called up BMW Support and asked if I could get access to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmwblog.com/2012/07/10/bmw-ready-sdk-for-third-party-apps-android-apps-coming/&quot;&gt;BMW Ready SDK&lt;/a&gt; so I could build my own apps. They declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to figure out this BMW Apps protocol and add my own music apps to the system, without their help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bluetooth-sniffing&quot;&gt;Bluetooth Sniffing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How hard could it be? Bluetooth is a standard protocol, I just have to learn what to say to the car and build up from there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh hey look, Android has built-in Bluetooth Capture logging! I'll just record what the phone app is saying to the car and see what I find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/bluetooth1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/bluetooth1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bluetooth Capture&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This SPP Protocol seemed to have lots of juicy information: I saw some X509 certificates, some XML data, some strings that look like song metadata, a ton of stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bcl-multiplexing&quot;&gt;BCL Multiplexing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing a pattern in the first bytes of most packets: The 0th byte was 0, the 1st byte was 1 or 6, the 2nd byte was 0, the 3rd byte was usually very low, and the next bytes were almost always &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0x0FA4&lt;/code&gt;. I figured out that the next 2 bytes were the length of the remaining data, and the next 4 bytes of data were almost always &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xDEADBEEF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/wireshark_bmw_bcl/commit/d5dc9a8ebcb206a84b21571c8ab4df8982ebc6b6&quot;&gt;began writing&lt;/a&gt; a Wireshark Lua plugin to help me understand the data, parsing the first bytes as 4 16-bit values named Val1, Val2, Val3, and Length, and then outputting the remaining bytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that this protocol is used to multiplex connections into a single Bluetooth serial socket, with Val2 being different connection IDs. With this field being parsed out in Wireshark, I could use display filters to follow an individual communication flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;apache-etch&quot;&gt;Apache Etch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of research, I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmw-carit.de/open-source/etch.php&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining that BMW uses Apache Etch as &quot;the fundamental communication protocol used for BMW Apps&quot;. A quick trip to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://etch.apache.org/documentation.html&quot;&gt;Apache Etch docs&lt;/a&gt; confirms that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0xDEADBEEF&lt;/code&gt; is the magic identifier at the start of every Etch RPC call. This means, then, that I just have to decode each BCL stream to Apache Etch packets, and Wireshark's built-in Etch parsing will take over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;apache-etch-symbol-names&quot;&gt;Apache Etch Symbol Names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, of course, that Apache Etch compiles each function name, and any other symbol names, into a 32-bit hash value. Wireshark can use an Etch debug artifact to replace the hash value with pretty names, but I first needed to figure out the names and hash them myself. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/etch/trunk/util/src/main/java/org/apache/etch/util/Hash.java&quot;&gt;Etch hash algorithm&lt;/a&gt; is public, so I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/etch-hash-rs&quot;&gt;Rust implementation&lt;/a&gt; to help generate this debug name artifact manually, since I don't have the original Etch IDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, where to get the names?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out JVM bytecode (which Android apps are equivalently written in) is very easy to decompile. Variable names are obfuscated a bit, but the Etch generated classes contain an exact list of all the available Etch symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ValueFactoryBMWRemoting.java:

    private static void a() {
        a = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.VersionInfo&quot;);
        b = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.SecurityException&quot;);
        c = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.ServiceException&quot;);
        d = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.IllegalArgumentException&quot;);
        e = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.IllegalStateException&quot;);
        f = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.ver_getVersion&quot;);
        g = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting._result_ver_getVersion&quot;);
        h = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.info_getSystemInfo&quot;);
        i = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting._result_info_getSystemInfo&quot;);
        j = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.sas_crl&quot;);
        k = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting._result_sas_crl&quot;);
        l = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.sas_certificate&quot;);
        m = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting._result_sas_certificate&quot;);
        n = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting.sas_login&quot;);
        o = (Type)hn.get(&quot;de.bmw.idrive.BMWRemoting._result_sas_login&quot;);
...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just run this list of names through my custom hasher, and give the resulting file to Wireshark, and get a beautiful protocol dump!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/wireshark_etch.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/wireshark_etch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wireshark Etch Decoding&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tcp-connection&quot;&gt;TCP Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had the decompiled code open, I poked around a little bit at the connection methods, and I discovered that the BMW Connected app runs a TCP localhost server which proxies all connections through this BCL multiplexed connection. This means that any rooted phone can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; and record every app's communication to the car, instead of running Bluetooth sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This additionally means that I don't need to rewrite the main BMW Connected app, I just need to open a TCP connection to a magic TCP port on the phone to get a direct connection to the car, and play the role of any other BMW-enabled app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I find out what port the proxy is running at? The BMW Connected app broadcasts a system-wide Android Intent with the connection details to use whenever the car connection is made. Additionally, it's hardcoded to a specific port, so I could just try to connect to the port manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely changed my approach: All I had to do is learn to talk this high-level RPC protocol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reconstructed-etch-idl&quot;&gt;Reconstructed Etch IDL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the generated Etch RPC classes from the app, I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/IDriveConnectKit/blob/master/etch/BMWRemoting.etch&quot;&gt;reconstruct an Etch IDL&lt;/a&gt; file, at least with the interesting bits I wanted. The Etch compiler happily accepted it and gave me back some proxy objects, even in the correct package layout as compared to my example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with my own set of Etch RPC classes, I could start poking things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fake-car&quot;&gt;Fake Car&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first intrusive investigation techniques was to implement the server side of the Etch RPC and then send my own connection announcement to the official app. Android Intents are the standard way for app components to talk to each other with loose coupling, and are entirely unauthenticated. This tricked the official app modules into connecting to my own Etch server under my control, instead of the BCL proxy to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Etch objects are stubbed out with NotImplementedExceptions, so it was very easy for me to watch which calls the official apps make. After filling out as much Fake Car as I needed to make the official app happy, the app (running inside an emulator) used the provided VIN number to download an image of the car it has never been physically connected to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/connected_emulator.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/connected_emulator.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Public Security Service&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first use of this fake car was to help investigate the expected responses to the authentication challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;car-authentication&quot;&gt;Car Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a new Etch connection is made from an app to the car, the first thing it does is send a PKCS7 certificate to the car. The car responds with a nonce, and the app is expected to respond with some authentication data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certificate is signed by a BMW CA, so there's no real way to get around that. However, these certs are easily available just by extracting files from app APKs, and the main Connected app includes about 10 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, how will I figure out the proper nonce response? It looks long enough to be an RSA4096 signature, which would not be fun to try to crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out JVM bytecode is very easy to decompile: After you decompile the entire app into obfuscated Java files, you can load the entire thing into Android Studio and use its strong code search and refactoring tools to help navigate the code. Perhaps a clue can be found in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;com.bmwgroup.connected.internal.security.CarSecurityManager&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes actually, the code clearly shows how it uses Android Binder RPC to connect to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CarSecurityService&lt;/code&gt; object and exchange a challenge nonce for a challenge response. Additionally, this service is exported for any app on the phone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/security_service.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/security_service.png&quot; alt=&quot;Public Security Service&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick test code verified that this service gives back the same answer as the Wireshark captures. The service implementation is a small JNI wrapper around a native library that suspiciously contains some OpenSSL symbols. Just for fun, I also wrote my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/IDriveConnectKitAndroid/tree/security_service&quot;&gt;minimal service implementation&lt;/a&gt; around this library for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-connection&quot;&gt;First Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, I quickly built a test app to try to make my first connection to the car! One of the first things the official apps do, from looking in the packet captures, is call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_getCapabilities&lt;/code&gt; to get a list of feature flags that the car supports, which seemed like a good first step to try to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involved implementing a BroadcastReceiver to listen for the car's connection announcement, acting as a client to the SecurityService to be ready for the challenge nonce, and actually instantiating the Etch proxy objects with the proper connection details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several trips between my desktop and the garage, I got a successful connection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/capabilities.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/capabilities.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Car Capabilities&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rhmi-resources&quot;&gt;RHMI Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary goal of this project was to add more music apps to the car, so my attention was naturally drawn to the RHMI namespace of calls, with enticing names like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_setData&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_onActionEvent&lt;/code&gt;. One of the first couple calls an app does is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_setResource&lt;/code&gt;, which is used to send an XML widget layout and some zip files. These resources are readily available in any BMW app's APK, lending themselves to easy examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, and most important, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/AndroidAutoIdrive/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/carapplications/basecoreOnlineServices/rhmi/ui_description.xml&quot;&gt;XML widget layout&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a list of components organized into windows, and a list of models shown in the components, and a list of actions linked to the widgets. Some of these models can hold arbitrary data from the phone app, while some hold numeric IDs pointing to resources from the zip files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zipped resources are simple: A graphics pack, with each file inside named by a numeric ID, or a translation text pack with strings keyed by ID. Looking around in the apps, there are different resource packs for BMW or Mini brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-app&quot;&gt;First App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as my first attempt to create an app in the car, I copied the initialization calls to send the remote UI resources, and then tested out the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_setData&lt;/code&gt; call to try loading an image to the car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/cat.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/cat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cat&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the action events system was pretty easy: After calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_addActionEventHandler&lt;/code&gt; to signal the car to send input events, the car will begin calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_onActionEvent&lt;/code&gt; with details about which action fired, and this action is linked back to an originating component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rhmi-whitelist&quot;&gt;RHMI Whitelist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next experiment was to try to edit the widget layout sent to the car. However, this immediately failed, with the car rejecting the upload with an exception. Uploading the original artifact still worked great, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, I found a list of SHA256 checkums in the authentication cert, and the original resources match up to those checkums. This means that I can't change any widget layout or the graphics packs. This is mainly a problem with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;entryButton&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, which is hardcoded to a specific icon from the graphics pack, so essentially any app that creates a RHMI app will show the app icon that belongs to the original authentication cert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/cert.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/cert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Certificate Restrictions&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;component-properties&quot;&gt;Component Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was disappointed: I wouldn't be able to build a very custom app if I'm locked into the original widget layout. However, sometimes I saw calls to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rhmi_setProperty&lt;/code&gt; in the Wireshark captures, and some of the components in the widget layout had a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; collection defined, but the properties were defined by a numeric ID. What could these properties be? Where could I figure out what these property IDs mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, Java bytecode is really easy to decompile, and I found this &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RhmiPropertyType&lt;/code&gt; enum that has the entire list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/properties.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/properties.png&quot; alt=&quot;Properties Enum&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though I can't change the widget configuration, I can set the widget properties, including visibility, position, and size, which still allows for a ton of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with these basic building blocks, I set to work building my own music app for the car! Except I already have several excellent music apps on the phone, I would prefer to add those apps to the car instead of writing my own. Is there some way I could instead control the existing music apps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Android encourages music apps to implement a protocol called MediaBrowserService. By implementing this single API, the app automatically becomes available through Android Auto, Android Wear, and supposedly the Bluetooth stack. I could just act as another client to this interface, and implement the car as a frontend on top of this API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/musicapps.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/musicapps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Music Apps&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;car-app-implementation&quot;&gt;Car App Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy made implementation relatively easy: I just needed to build a client to this MediaBrowserService, and whenever any metadata callbacks happen, update the car's labels with the appropriate information. Button callbacks from the car could run commands against the music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then after months of polish, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hufman/AndroidAutoIdrive&quot;&gt;music app&lt;/a&gt; with full browse and search support, which can control any MediaBrowserService music app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/musicapp.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/stories/images/bmwconnectedapps/musicapp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Music App&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-analysis&quot;&gt;Security Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this another instance of terrible car security, letting random attackers explode your car from the other side of the world? Not at all! This is entirely separate from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edent/BMW-i-Remote/blob/master/README.md#description&quot;&gt;Connected Drive protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used to hack your car from the other side of the world. This Connected Apps protocol only functions over a local connection from your phone to the (running) car over USB or Bluetooth. There are a number of other security restrictions in place, to reduce the chance for mischief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;19.710743801653&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone app has to log in with a cert signed by BMW. However, these certs are easily accessible, just by extracting any existing app. In fact, official companion apps (such as Spotify) host a ContentProvider for the official app to fetch the app-specific certs and log into the car on their behalf. This ContentProvider provides read access to the cert for any app on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This authentication cert has a whitelist of permissions: What brand(s) of car it can authenticate in, what features it unlocks, what sections of the Car Data Service it can access, whether app creation is available or not and with what assets. However, perhaps for ease of development, the official certs are pretty much wide open, only locking down the assets to some nicely generic layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car exchanges a login nonce for the client app to sign. In 2018, BMW did remove the exported service which allowed any app to ask for the answer to this challenge. While they can't remove it from the Connected Classic app, because the Play Store won't let them update it without updating the targeted Android API level, most users will be safe, running the new Connected app. However, unscrupulous attackers could just include the JNI library to generate their own challenge responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.683615819209&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps are sandboxed. The apps can only access information from the (read-only) &lt;a href=&quot;https://hufman.github.io/BMWConnectedAnalysis/cds/&quot;&gt;Car Data Service&lt;/a&gt;, they don't get direct canbus access. New app layouts are hidden behind an app's entry button in the menu, and any global state is only modified through specific functions: Set the music metadata, trigger navigation, start a phone call, and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.8495297805643&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol is deprecated and going away. BMW's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pocket-lint.com/cars/news/bmw/146565-bmw-live-cockpit-bmw-operating-system-7-0-infotainment&quot;&gt;Live Cockpit&lt;/a&gt; system does not support any of this remote app protocol, instead finally adding Android Auto support to their existing Apple Carplay support. There will be some apps baked into the car, but apps from the phone won't be able to integrate in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further reduce mischief, BMW should use their sandboxing experience and start a developer program like GM has done, for users to express their creativity and build their own apps to contribute to an app store. This entire reverse engineering project started because I wanted to add new functionality to my car, using the marvelous technology that BMW provided. The entire car modding scene shows the devotion people have for tinkering with their cars, and with cars being increasingly software-driven, this is simply the next phase of that same idea.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Analysis of compensation, level, and experience details of 19k tech workers</title>
<link>https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There are several metrics important to our career progress: How much should I be paid? How long should it take me to get to the next level? Does my field really favor the young and if so, does my career have a deadline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers know the answers as they have the benefit of seeing an aggregated picture through dealing with many candidates and employees. The majority of us, however, may only work with a handful of employers in our entire life. And when we’re early in our careers, this type of information is a blackbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imbalance of information gives employers more leverage, both during offer negotiations and promotion discussions. Last year, I’ve helped around 20 friends negotiate their offers – most of them for their first jobs. I notice that they all originally aimed for a package lower than what people with their backgrounds should be paid. One notable example is a candidate who told me he would be happy with &lt;strong&gt;$120k/year&lt;/strong&gt; and ended up with an offer of &lt;strong&gt;$180k/year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imbalance of information especially hurts candidates of underrepresented groups who don’t already know people who can help guide them through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see an initiative by &lt;a href=&quot;https://levels.fyi&quot;&gt;levels.fyi&lt;/a&gt; to let people share their compensation details anonymously and everyone can see the range of compensation for people at certain levels at certain companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, levels.fyi shared with me the data. As far as I know, this is &lt;strong&gt;the largest data on compensation and level details of tech workers&lt;/strong&gt;. I used their dataset as a proxy to answer four questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long does it take for software engineers to reach a certain level? E.g. how long, on average, does it take for one person to become a senior engineer or a principal engineer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much money do tech workers actually make? How is it different across jobs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do women get paid less than men in tech? This compares the compensation details of people at the same company, same job, same level, same state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tech industry is notorious for favoring the young. Do younger engineers really make more money? What’s the correlation between the number of years of experience and the total yearly compensation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The data is &lt;em&gt;self-reported anonymously&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore suffers from all the biases of self-reported, anonymous data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just because there’s no evidence in the data to support something, doesn’t mean that something doesn’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table of contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career progression analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compensation analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compensation by gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some basic cleaning, deduplication, and outlier removal, I get the self-reported compensation details of &lt;strong&gt;18.8k&lt;/strong&gt; tech workers. Each entry contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;compensation details (broken down to base salaries, equity, bonus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;years of experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;years at company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;13k&lt;/strong&gt; samples with gender specified as Female or Male. Of which, &lt;strong&gt;13.27%&lt;/strong&gt; are female. This is close to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/09/7-facts-about-the-stem-workforce/&quot;&gt;PEW research in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that women make up only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of these entries come from the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;40% from California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24% from Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most popular cities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Seattle, WA         3119
San Francisco, CA   2331
New York, NY        1133
Redmond, WA         1091
Sunnyvale, CA       877
Mountain View, CA   859
San Jose, CA        648
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FAAAM (Facebook, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft) employees make up &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt; of the entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

facebook        873
apple           781
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;65%&lt;/strong&gt; of the entries are software engineers. 7 most popular jobs account for &lt;em&gt;88%&lt;/em&gt; of all the entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

hardware engineer   460
product designer    366
solution architect  350
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies have different levels. For example, Google’s levels go from L3 to L10 but Microsoft goes from SDE to Technical Fellow while NVIDIA goes from IC1 to IC9. levels.fyi tried to standardize most levels for software engineering across major companies to 6 levels from Entry Level Engineer to Distinguished Engineer. They didn’t annotate standard levels for entries from smaller companies, because roles at smaller companies are more fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Entry Level Engineer      3526
Software Engineer         3965

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Levels across companies&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/1_levels_fyi.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on how these levels compare across companies, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://levels.fyi&quot;&gt;levels.fyi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Career progression analysis for software engineers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have the number of years people take to reach a level. What we have is the number of years of experience someone has, and what level they are right now. The number we have is the sum of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the number of years it takes for them to reach that level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of years they have been at that level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For engineering roles at some companies, after you reach a certain level, it’s very hard to progress to the next level, e.g. it’s hard to progress beyond level SDE III at Amazon or beyond L6 at Google. Some people either stay at the role for a long time, change company, or change careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting bias&lt;/strong&gt;: people tend to round up their number of years of experience to the nearest integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If after graduation, people become an entry level engineer, then on average, it takes 1 year to get out of that entry level position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After spending 4 years as a software engineer to become a senior sotware engineer, it takes another 4 years to become a staff engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes, on average, 18 years to become a Distinguished Engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Median years of experience for standard levels&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/2_yoe_std_levels.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.1 Career progression at major companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the time it takes to move from a level to the next at FAAAM companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Google, on average, people at L7 has one year of experience less than people at L6. One theory is that to get to L7 at Google, you have to be really good, and really good people get promoted faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Median years of experience for different levels at Google and Facebook&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/3_google_facebook_yoe.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Median years of experience for different levels at Amazon&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/4_amazon_yoe.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.2 As level increases, the percentage of female software engineers decreases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both at standard levels across all companies, and within each major company. This is consistent with the known women’s leadership gap, both in tech and out of tech [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-tech-women-trfn/getting-better-more-women-in-tech-but-not-at-the-top-idUSKBN1XG2PN&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/fact-sheet/the-data-on-women-leaders/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because of the ceiling, it’s harder for women to be promoted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women leave tech before they get promoted. According to a research by the Center for Work-Life Policy study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-more-than-half-of-women-leave-the-tech-industry/&quot;&gt;more than half of women in tech leave the industry by the mid-point of their career, which is more than double the rate of men&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed surveyed 1,000 women in the field and found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90274067/this-is-why-women-leave-jobs-in-tech&quot;&gt;the main reasons women leave tech are: advancement opportunities, wage disparity, and work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because more women entered tech recently, there are more women at lower levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Percentage of female software engineers at different levels&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/5_gender_std.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Percentage of female software engineers at different levels by company&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/6_gender_level_company.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Compensation analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compensations of tech workers follow a skew normal distribution with a small percentage making an outlier amount of money: e.g. tech workers in India or Russia can make under $20k, while top engineers at Google, Facebook, OpenAI can make millions a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each compensation package consists of 3 components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;base salary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity (stock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.1 Distribution of Total Yearly Compensation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median yearly compensation is &lt;strong&gt;$195,000&lt;/strong&gt;, while the mean is &lt;strong&gt;$225,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution of compensation for tech workers&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/7_compensation.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is significantly higher than the results of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#salary&quot;&gt;StackOverflow survey in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which states that the median salary for Engineering Manager in the US is only &lt;strong&gt;$152,000&lt;/strong&gt;. This might be because of the differences between StackOverflow data and Levels.fyi data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;StackOverflow data is smaller (14.7k samples)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StackOverflow data is more fragmented with respondents from all over the world while Levels.fyi data is more US/FAAAM-focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StackOverflow surveyed salary, while Levels.fyi asks for the whole compensation package, which includes base salary, stock grants, and bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution of compensation for tech workers by StackOverflow&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/17_so.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.2 Total Yearly Compensation by Standard Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As level increases, base salary and bonus increase little, but stock grants increases the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock grant is often vested over 4 years – if you’re granted 100 shares, then each year 25 shares are vested. Your stock grant is usually refreshed with new shares each year. After your first year, you’re grant 100 extra shares, so next year you can vest 25 old shares + 25 new shares = 50 shares. The longer you stay at a company, the more stock you have left to vest. This structure of compensation is to incentivize employees to stay longer at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: when negotiating with big companies, it’s harder to make substantial change to the base salary offer than to improve the stock grant and bonus offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Compensation packages by levels&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/8_compensation_level.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.3 Compensation by Years of Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a medium correlation between income and years of experience. The correlation is stronger for people early in their careers. As you gain more years of experience, your compensation generally improves, until you reach 18 years of experience. The median compensation for those with more than 18 years of experience is actually lower for those with less than 18 years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tech workers – software engineers, hardware engineers, and product managers – with more than 15 years of experience, the correlation regresses to slightly below 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Correlation between years of experience and total yearly compensation&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/9_yoe_corr.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.4 Compensation by job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each job that has at least 350 entries, the median ranges between 180k to 320k. It’s not surprising that SWE manager has the highest median. There’s also a very low percentage of women in SWE Manager (8.75%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job with the lowest median income, product designer, coincidentally also has the highest percentage of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by jobs&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/10_gender_jobs.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Compensation by gender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.1 In all data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distributions of income for men and women in the entire dataset – across all companies, all locations, all levels, all jobs – match each other surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all those report their incomes here, the median for male is $11k (6%) higher than that for female. It’s due to more male engineers at the right tail of the distribution (higher compensation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by jobs&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/11_gender_income.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.2 By job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median compensation of women is slightly lower than the median compensation for men for most jobs, except for the role of Data Scientist and Software Engineering Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by job&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/11_gender_income_job.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.3 By company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median income of women is less than that of men in all FAAAM companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by company&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/12_gender_income_faaam.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.4 By standard level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s virtually no difference in compensation between men and women at Entry Level Engineer and Software Engineer. However, as the standard level increases, the percentage of women decreases and the compensation gap widens. This might be because at entry levels, women and men are both given standard offers. As levels increase, pay raises require negotiation and according to research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2015/04/23/401468571/some-companies-fight-pay-gap-by-eliminating-salary-negotiations&quot;&gt;when it comes to negotiating salaries, women are less assertive than men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to restate the &lt;strong&gt;disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: just because there’s no evidence in the data to support something, doesn’t mean that something doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by standard level&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/13_gender_income_std_level.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.5 By years of experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s virtually no difference in compensation between men and women at for those with less than 3 years of experience. The gap starts appearing later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by years of experience&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/18_gender_yoe.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.6 Income by gender for those of the same level, same company, same state, same job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When controlled by all the above variables, there’s virtually no difference in compensations at the entrance level for software engineers at the big companies that we analyzed. In the case of Amazon, the median of compensation for female engineers at SDE and SDE II is actually higher than that for male engineers at the same level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap might start appearing after the first two levels. However, we don’t have enough data for female samples to make any meaningful visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the small number of female samples, we sample without replacement from male samples so that we have the same number of samples for men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4.6.1 Software Engineers at Microsoft in Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only analyze SDE and SDE II, the first two levels at Microsoft, because we don’t have enough female samples for higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by jobs&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/14_msft.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4.6.2 Software Engineers at Google in California&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only analyze L3 and L4, the first two levels at Google, because we don’t have enough female samples for higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by jobs&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/15_google.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4.6.3 Software Engineers at Amazon in both California and Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only analyze SDE I and SDE II, the first two levels at Amazon, because we don’t have enough female samples for higher levels. We use two states instead of one because one doesn’t give us enough data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Income and gender by jobs&quot; src=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/levels/16_amazon.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The median compensation for software engineers in our data (skewed towards FAAAM, CA/WA-based) starts at around &lt;strong&gt;$160k/year&lt;/strong&gt; for entry level, and reaches around &lt;strong&gt;half a million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As level increases, the percentage of women decreases both across companies and in each FAAAM company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our data shows that at entry level, there’s virtually no difference between the compensation of men and women. The gap starts appearing only as the level progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech favors the young. For people with more than 15 years of experience, there’s practically no correlation between years of experience and income (corr &amp;lt; 0). After 15 years of experience, you either retire, switch to management, or change career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that this analysis can guide people in making important career decisions. I don’t wish to make people look at this analysis and compare themselves to the median or whatever statistics there is. Each of us is more than a statistics. Everyone has their own struggle. The average person doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope that big companies would start publishing analysis of their internal data for transparency, so that we don’t have to rely on anonymous, self-reported data to answer these important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Zaheer Mohiuddin, Bruno Faviero, Andrey Kurenkov, and Paul Marum for giving me helpful feedback. They, however, aren’t responsible for any error that might exist in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis was done as part of the research for my upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://huyenchip.com/2019/07/21/machine-learning-interviews.html&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Interviews Book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
