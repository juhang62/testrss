<title>Tesla Model 3 becomes best-selling car in Switzerland</title>
<link>https://electrek.co/2019/04/09/tesla-model-3-best-selling-car-period-switzerland/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://electrek.co/2019/04/09/tesla-model-3-best-selling-car-period-switzerland/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tesla Model 3 became the best-selling car in Switzerland last month – beating not just other electric vehicles, but all passenger vehicles period.&lt;span id=&quot;more-89235&quot;/&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle author_ad&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4655152367470280&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5555766060&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, Model 3 has become the best-selling electric car in virtually all markets it has been introduced in, but it is also starting to become the best-selling car period in some markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like in Norway, but electric vehicles are always topping the charts in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tesla is also dominating the market in Switzerland with the introduction of the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzz.ch/mobilitaet/auto-mobil/tesla-model-3-bestverkauftes-auto-in-der-schweiz-ld.1473810&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;registration data&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla delivered 1,094 Model 3 vehicles in Switzerland in March – beating the long-standing bestsellers Skoda Octavia (801) and the VW Golf (546).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Model 3 has helped Tesla already push its 2019 delivery numbers past its full-year 2018 delivery results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has long been an important market for Tesla. The automaker has often delivered more vehicles in the small market than in the much bigger neighboring German market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tesla &lt;a class=&quot;gs-title&quot; href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-cturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&amp;amp;sa=U&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2s2-2sPhAhXp7IMKHQ9BCigQFggIMAE&amp;amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;amp;cx=008464549922976904202:3wy4ipwvlno&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1RLH3RoAHHsNb6HVpwW4V0&quot; data-ctorig=&quot;https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&quot;&gt;Model S was often at the top of the best-selling electric cars in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I like to mention when discussing Tesla’s Model 3 deliveries in Europe, that’s just with the two most expensive versions of the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those numbers should go way up when Tesla introduces some less expensive versions of the vehicle later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if Model 3 is in the top 5 of the bestselling vehicles in the most important auto markets in Europe several months later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it will be consistent due to Tesla’s cyclical production and deliveries in Europe, but the numbers should still be extremely impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Dutch East India Co was richer than Apple, Google, Facebook combined (2017)</title>
<link>https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/how-rich-was-the-dutch-east-india-company</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/how-rich-was-the-dutch-east-india-company</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how rich was the Dutch East India Company? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what paid for all those nice canals and houses in Amsterdam, Leiden and Utrecht. Well, this image might explain it all a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/most-valuable-companies-all-time/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dutchtradingcompare.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Feel free to dive right into the things with us – it certainly wasn’t great for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dutch East-India Company – Apple Didn’t Have Nothing On It!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC), better known as the Dutch East-India company was set up in 1602, head-quartered in the “Oost-Indisch Huis” (East-India House) in downtown Amsterdam – which still stands today. It was founded as a private merchant company that was granted a two decade long monopoly by the government for spice trading in Asia, in particular the Dutch East-Indies, known today as the Republic of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you think Amazon is thrifty with deliveries – the VOC sent over one million voyagers across Asia, which is more than the rest of Europe combined, in a time where a trip from Amsterdam to Batavia (Djakarta) would last no shorter than 8 to 10 months and many ships, or individual passengers, would never return. Many of the massive sailing ships perished in storms, fell prey to piracy or infectious disease. Traveling at the time came at a huge risk, but once on location and with the right knowledge and attitude there was a great chance of becoming wealthy and so many took the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was also the first official company to issue stocks, which peaked during the Dutch “Tulip Mania”, a craze for tulip bulbs that is seen as the world’s first true financial bubble. The VOC’s stocks pushed the company’s worth to a massive 78 million Dutch guilders, which is a pretty solid business even today, but translates to a whopping $7,9 trillion dollar worth today… Yes, really, trillion. That’s 7,900 billion – or 79,000 million!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dutch are doing pretty good in modern times as well, different reasons why of course – Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8h9LBNe6bxE_DkQfBooB2g&quot;&gt;our youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more videos like this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modern-day Companies Don’t Even Compare! (And That’s a Good Thing!)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’speak the VOC was worth the equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, ExxonMobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Tencent, and Wells Fargo put together! This means that the world’s most valuable company, Apple, is worth about 11% of the peak value of the VOC. Eat that, Steve Jobs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-21296&quot; src=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/rich-Dutch-East-India-Company-1024x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also worth, roughly, the same amount as the GDP’s of Japan and Germany of today added together. Can you dig it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also employed 70,000(!) people across the globe, making it a textbook multinational by definition, and this was nearly four centuries ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(We’re on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/dutchreview/&quot;&gt; Instagram&lt;/a&gt; too!)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Dutch East India Company was also pretty evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;55.143865150921&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn’t all fun and games with the Dutch East India Company – despite bringing the Netherlands prosperity and successfully connecting the world it also brought horrendous suffering for an endless number of people. For two centuries long the VOC did whatever it had to make sure its assets were protected and profit was high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included &lt;a href=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/dutch-slavery-our-dark-past/&quot;&gt;slave trading,&lt;/a&gt; colonial oppression and absurd mistreatment of employees – if you think your job is tough today, try being a deckhand on a year and a half VOC-round trip or, even much worse, a slave living in semi-dark in the belly of the ship!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VOC is thought to have transported, or rather ‘displaced’, as many as 50,000 people from Africa to serve or trade as slaves in its colonies. It’s a staggering number, worse however is that many countries subjected even more people to slavery per individual nation than the Dutch and VOC ever managed to, creating a permanent “involuntary” change in demographics around the globe. The success of international trading companies like the VOC has forever put a stain on Europe’s colonial past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-21320 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2017-12-12-at-11.18.29-1024x571.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;571&quot;/&gt;Crazy rich – Source: Visual Capitalist
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of its endless exploitation these trading companies, and colonies, have shaped the world and are at the foot of today’s ‘multiculturalism’ and the modern-day economy. Still many people are in denial about their country’s colonial past, Holland for one definitely gained its historic wealth and fortune over the heads of others, which is not to say that it’s the fault of the modern Dutchman – it’s hard to blame someone for something they never had a hand in. But denial or downplaying is flat out ignorant and inexcusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s always wise to speak with some discretion to people of color, even in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/all-turks-back-to-morocco-a-guide-to-the-traditional-migrants-in-the-netherlands/&quot;&gt;‘multi-culti’ Holland&lt;/a&gt;, as the Indo- and Moluccan people are direct descendants of the VOC-days and black Surinam and Antillean-people are African slave descendants, their Hindu-counterparts having been ‘contract laborers’ from the Indian-subcontinent which was hardly better than being a slave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, we hope you enjoyed this piece about the Dutch East India Company – and maybe sparked some curiosity about the Dutch trading spirit and their adventurous outset on becoming a world leader, but it would be irresponsible for us not to have mentioned the downsides that came with it. That much in the least is what every Dutchman owes the world, especially given that people of a colonial past are of such vital importance to modern Holland as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use for Text (2018)</title>
<link>https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Update 2017-09-25: Simplified the table syntax even more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update 2018-04-06: Comments on the standardization argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language&quot;&gt;lightweight markup languages&lt;/a&gt; and why I think that Org-mode is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do note that this is not about Emacs. This is about Org-mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org-mode in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad&quot;&gt;notepad.exe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt;, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing&quot;&gt;Wikitext&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText&quot;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Org-mode is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org-mode syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 * This Is A Heading
 ** This Is A Sub-Heading
 *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading

 Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

 *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced=
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]]
 http://Karl-Voit.at → link without description

 : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
 : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.

 - list item
 - another item
   - sub-item
     1. also enumerated
     2. if you like
 - [ ] yet to be done
 - [X] item which is done         
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen many coworkers who typed Org-mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was learning Org-mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org-mode right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          42 | foo         | bar         |
 |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          65 |             |             |      
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org-mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 | My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-
 | 42 | foo | bar|
 | 23 | baz | abcdefg|
 |-
 | 65 |||         
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Standardized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; has many flavors to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use &quot;Markdown&quot; for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Org-mode, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org-mode accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Consistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings. There are basically three ways of defining headings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prefix headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre- and postfix headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underlined headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples for each category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 Prefix headings:

 # Heading 1
 ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3

 Pre- and postfix headings:

 = Heading 1 =
 == Heading 2 ==
 === Heading 3 ===

 Underlined headings:

 Heading 1
 =========

 Heading 2
 ~~~~~~~~~

 Heading 3
 *********        
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the prefix heading style. Org-mode use this as well with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre- and postfix headings&lt;/strong&gt; do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; heading == with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse than this is the &lt;strong&gt;underlined heading category&lt;/strong&gt;. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your &quot;order&quot; of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html&quot;&gt;reStructuredText mode of Emacs&lt;/a&gt; you can find following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the current buffer by invoking &lt;code&gt;rst-display-adornments-hierarchy&lt;/code&gt;, bound on &lt;code&gt;C-c C-a C-d&lt;/code&gt;. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section adornments correspond to which levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more: some markup languages even allow &lt;strong&gt;mixed heading styles&lt;/strong&gt;. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at a different markup element: &lt;strong&gt;external links&lt;/strong&gt;. As you already remember in Org-mode, a link looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]     
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Link_syntax&quot;&gt;examples from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and comments by me where a user might be irritated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AsciiDoc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 http://example.com[Text]          
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form is simple but for complex URLs, the &lt;code&gt;[Text]&lt;/code&gt; might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 [Text](http://example.com)
 [Text](http://example.com &quot;Title&quot;)       
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the &lt;code&gt;Title&lt;/code&gt; part of the URL? Why not part of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reStructuredText:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 `Text &amp;lt;http://example.com/&amp;gt;`_       
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; and not apostrophes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has &quot;lightweight&quot; in its class name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Can Be Easily Typed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple syntax of Org-mode does not imply typing unnecessary characters. You don't have to manually align something like underlined headings. Anybody using a simple text editor is very fast at adding markup for headings, font variations, and so forth. The previous section proved that other markup languages clearly fail in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Makes Sense Outside of Emacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to use the Emacs editor to write and work with Org-mode markup text. As I mentioned above, many people already do so just because Org-mode is an intuitive and clean way of typing text characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've got text information in Org-mode markup, you can process it with many tools. Most prominent and most important examples are files pushed within a GitHub repository and the swiss army knife named &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; which is able to convert Org-mode to dozens of formats like HTML, odt (LibreOffice), docx (Word), LaTeX, PDF, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Has Excellent Tool Support (If You Want)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the beginning, this is not an article about Emacs. Nevertheless for anybody not familiar with Emacs I have to mention that with Emacs there is a tool that supports (not only) in writing Org-mode syntax in a perfect way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might start with mouse-only usage. There are menu items with all important functions. For the users that want to get a minimum of efficiency, the menu items show you &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf&quot;&gt;the keyboard shortcuts you might want to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Org-mode it is really easy to learn. Basically you just have to use &lt;code&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; for toggle the collapsing and expanding of headings, lists, and blocks. It's &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; and the arrow keys to move around headings, list items, and even table columns/rows. &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Return&lt;/code&gt; creates a new heading or list item without the need of entering the markup characters and manually matching indentation levels at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. With those three things you're good to write Org-mode syntax efficiently. The basic file open/save, finding help, exiting Emacs stuff is accessible with icons or the menu. No need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf&quot;&gt;learn more keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; if you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having experienced this great tool-support, users typically are eager to learn more. You don't have to. You might be happy with Org-mode for capturing minutes of meetings and your shopping list. However, others do master a few additional things and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vikasrawal/endingmalnutrition&quot;&gt;write whole eBooks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5313&quot;&gt;within Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightweight markup languages are designed to be used with a minimum effort compared to full-blown and therefore more complicated markup languages such as HTML or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are doing their job better than others. In my experience, many design decisions of widely adapted markups such as Markdown or reStructuredText (and others) are questionable from a usability point of view. At least I do have some issues when I have to use them in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I hardly see any people out there using Org-mode as a markup language outside of Emacs although there are very good reasons for it as an easy to learn and easy to use markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog article I wanted to point out the usefulness of Org-mode even when you are not using Emacs as an writing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlinks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwvl3d4/&quot;&gt;&quot;revocation&quot; has a valid point related to the missing standardization of Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. Here is my comment on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statements here refer to a /lightweight/ markup, the basic things of Org-mode syntax. I explicitly listed &quot;headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do not cover here is a full syntax statement or standard. In my opinion, currently this is not possible outside of Emacs for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwizwjs/&quot;&gt;variations in interpreting Org-mode files between Emacs and pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. Also, pandoc only supports a sub-set of Org-mode. Otherwise, pandoc would have to re-implement or embed Emacs for parsing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this specific case, pandoc seems to have a more strict parser related to leading spaces for #-lines, or keywords. I'm pretty sure that the pandoc project accepts this issue as a bug. In doubt, the interpretation of Emacs is the definition, or golden-standard, of Org-mode syntax. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html&quot;&gt;this beta-version of a syntax definition&lt;/a&gt; does not mention optional spaces before keywords. &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-syntax.html&quot;&gt;The manual&lt;/a&gt; mentions &lt;code&gt;org-element-parse-buffer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;org-lint&lt;/code&gt; which would be most probably the best choice for defining the official standard if you would search for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does not relate at all with the intention of this article: the design of the (basic) Org-mode syntax compared to other lightweight markup languages. All the issues mentioned where other markups show inconsistencies and usability issues where Org-mode seems to have advantages still do apply here. Completely independent of the standardization argument. My personal believe is, that if there would be more use of Org-mode syntax elements outside of Emacs, there would be a much higher pressure on formally defining Org-mode as a syntax which pandoc and even Emacs could use as the golden standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there is not even the necessity of defining this golden standard because nobody outside of the Emacs community knows or even is using Org-mode. And this is what I tried to change a bit because other markup languages do tend to hurt my geeky soul when I do have to use them. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A fork() in the road</title>
<link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-fork-in-the-road/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-fork-in-the-road/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The received wisdom suggests that Unix’s unusual combination of &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; for process creation was an inspired design. In this paper, we argue that fork was a clever hack for machines and programs of the 1970s that has long outlived its usefulness and is now a liability. We catalog the ways in which fork is a terrible abstraction for the modern programmer to use, describe how it compromises OS implementations, and propose alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the designers and implementers of operating systems, we should acknowledge that fork’s continued existence as a first-class OS primitive holds back systems research, and deprecate it. As educators, we should teach fork as a historical artifact, and not the first process creation mechanism students encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The U.S. government is about to bar the IRS from creating a free e-filing system</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/the-government-is-about-to-permanently-bar-the-irs-from-creating-a-free-electronic-filing-system/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/the-government-is-about-to-permanently-bar-the-irs-from-creating-a-free-electronic-filing-system/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Thanks to pressure from tax preparation industry, Congress is getting ready to ban the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/internal-revenue-service-irs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;internal-revenue-service-irs&quot;&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; from ever building a free electronic tax filing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-is-about-to-ban-the-government-from-offering-free-online-tax-filing-thank-turbotax&quot;&gt;As ProPublica reports&lt;/a&gt;, the effort is a bipartisan one. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Massachusetts Democrat, Richard Neal, passed the Taxpayer First Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would make changes to the IRS and is sponsored by Georgia Democratic Congressman &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/john-lewis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;john-lewis&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of its stipulations would make it illegal for the IRS to create its own online system for tax filing. That’s right, members of Congress are prohibiting a branch of the federal government from providing a much-needed service that would make the lives of all of their constituents much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is Congress taking the step? Because companies like &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/intuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;intuit&quot;&gt;Intuit,&lt;/a&gt; the company behind &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/turbotax&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;turbotax&quot;&gt;TurboTax,&lt;/a&gt; and H&amp;amp;R Block have been lobbying lawmakers for years to take the step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other countries, the agencies in charge of taxes have their own programs which make filing taxes more efficient — and free — for citizens. But that would eat into the profits for the tax prep industry, which was estimated to pull in $11 billion in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a disaster. It could be the final nail in the coffin of the idea of the IRS ever being able to create its own program,” Mandi Matlock, a tax attorney who does work for the National Consumer Law Center, told ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways that the IRS could make tax preparation easier for taxpayers dealing with the only certainty in life other than death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRS could develop a free online system. It could also submit pre-prepared tax returns for people to approve and then file based on the salary data the agency already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 70% of American taxpayers are already able to file for free online, but only 3% do, according to data from the taxpayer advocacy organization, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Free_File_Program_Is_Failing_to_Achieve_Objectives&quot;&gt;The Taxpayer Advocate Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans who make less than $66,000 can access the Free File Inc. software online through the IRS.gov website and all taxpayers can download electronic versions of IRS paper forms through the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2002, the IRS entered into an agreement with a consortium fo tax software companies, which was known as &lt;a title=&quot;Free File, Inc. (FFI)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/about-the-free-file-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Free File, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;  As part of that deal, the companies agreed to open up access to filing software for about taxpayers who make less than $66,000 and the IRS agreed not to compete with the companies by developing its own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deal has been renewed for over a decade and the new bill before Congress would make it permanent. One reason why folks Congress could be pushing this through is all of the money that H&amp;amp;R Block and Intuit spent to lobby Senators and Representatives. ProPublica estimates that the tax prep industry has spent $6.6 million to advocate for the IRS filing deal. The Ways and Means chair, Neal, received $16,000 in contributions from the two companies in the last two election cycles, according to the ProPublica report.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Thanks to pressure from tax preparation industry, Congress is getting ready to ban the Internal Revenue Service from ever building a free electronic tax filing system.

<title>Udacity restructures operations, lays off 20 percent of its workforce</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/udacity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;udacity&quot;&gt;Udacity,&lt;/a&gt; the $1 billion online education startup, has laid off about 20 percent of its workforce and is restructuring its operations as the company’s co-founder &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/sebastian-thrun&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;sebastian-thrun&quot;&gt;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a&gt; seeks to bring costs in line with revenue without curbing growth, TechCrunch has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to do more than simply keep the company afloat, Thrun told TechCrunch in a phone interview. Instead, Thrun says these measures will allow Udacity to move from a money-losing operation to a “break-even or profitable company by next quarter and then moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75 employees, including a handful of people in leadership positions, were laid off earlier today as part of a broader plan to restructure operations at Udacity. The startup now employs 300 full-time equivalent employees. It also employs about 60 contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Udacity, which specializes in “nanodegrees” on a range of technical subjects that include AI, deep learning, digital marketing, VR and computer vision, has been struggling for months now, due in part to runaway costs and other inefficiencies. The company grew in 2017, with revenue increasing 100 percent year-over-year thanks to some popular programs like its self-driving car and deep learning nanodegrees, and the culmination of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/shernaz-daver-the-cmo-who-helped-to-turn-around-udacity-is-leaving-the-company/&quot;&gt;previous turnaround plan&lt;/a&gt; architected by former CMO Shernaz Daver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New programming was added in 2018, but the volume slowed. Those degrees that were added lacked the popularity of some of its other degrees. Meanwhile, costs expanded and their employee ranks swelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udacity CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/vishal-makhijani-steps-down-as-chief-executive-of-udacity/&quot;&gt;Vishal Makhijani&lt;/a&gt; left in October and Thrun stepped in. He took over as chief executive and the head of content on an interim basis. Thrun, who founded X, Google’s moonshot factory, is also CEO of Kitty Hawk Corp., a flying-car startup. In an earlier interview, Thrun told TechCrunch that he discovered the company had grown too quickly and was burdened by its own self-inflicted red tape. Staff &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/online-education-unicorn-udacity-has-quietly-laid-off-5-of-staff-at-least-25-people-since-august/&quot;&gt;reductions&lt;/a&gt; soon followed. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/edtech-unicorn-udacity-lays-off-125-people-in-global-strategy-shift/&quot;&gt;130 people were laid off&lt;/a&gt; and other open positions were left vacant, Thrun said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thrun insists these latest layoffs aren’t just a half-hearted attempt to quickly cut costs and instead are part of a strategic turnaround plan. He communicated that same thinking in the email sent to employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“By bringing our costs in line with our revenue and refocusing our product strategy, we believe we can continue to grow the overall business both in enterprise and consumer segments in fiscal 2019 and beyond, while also achieving a break-even position in terms of both cash flow and EBITA, which will ensure that we can continue to do our important work,” Thrun wrote toward the end of the email to employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last year, Udacity generated about $90 million in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Udacity slashes costs and headcount, it’s trying to expand its enterprise business, which has had recent success. Udacity now has contracts with 60 enterprise customers, including AT&amp;amp;T and PricewaterhouseCoopers. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbus-group&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;airbus-group&quot;&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/audi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;audi&quot;&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; recently signed on, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udacity’s plan was developed largely by Lalit Singh, the interim COO hired in February. Singh conducted a review of the business, including its operating model and Udacity’s primary costs such as workforce, marketing and other non-workforce expenses. As a result of the review, Udacity has laid off more staff, streamlined operations and programming and cut other costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and we also have some challenges. To succeed, we have to ensure that we have an operating structure that allows us to be nimble, efficient, and better organized to win with fewer silos and frankly, reduced cost,” Thrun wrote in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As of Tuesday, four executives who handle different aspects of the business now report directly to Thrun. Those executives include Singh, Alper Tekin, who recently became CPO, James Richard, who was VP of engineering and has been named CTO, and Caroline Finch, vice president of consumer growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Alex Varel, the company’s head of enterprise sales, and Jimmy Lee, head of enterprise operations, will now report to Singh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The change is striking compared to October, when Thrun came back to temporarily fill the CEO role. At that time, 17 people reported to Thrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Udacity also has cut costs and streamlined its marketing efforts, downsized and consolidated office space and made its educational programming consistent throughout the various regions in which it operates, including the U.S., Brazil, China and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The company will keep an office, albeit a smaller space, in Mountain View, and one in San Francisco. Udacity is closing an additional satellite office in San Francisco and is evaluating its real estate needs in other countries, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. senators introduce social media bill to ban &amp;#039;dark patterns&amp;#039; tricks</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban online social media companies like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc from tricking consumers into giving up their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill from Mark Warner, a Democrat, and Deb Fischer, a Republican, would also ban online platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users from designing addicting games or other websites for children under age 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill takes aim at practices that online platforms use to mislead people into giving personal data to companies or otherwise trick them. The so-called “dark patterns” were developed using behavioral psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Misleading prompts to just click the ‘OK’ button can often transfer your contacts, messages, browsing activity, photos, or location information without you even realizing it,” Fischer said in a statement issued by both senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on how social media companies collect information about users could hurt their ability to sell advertisements, a key source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website aimed at tracking dark patterns identifies behavior, such as a website or app showing that a user has new notifications when they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner said in an interview on CNBC that the legislation could be included in a federal privacy bill that lawmakers in the Senate Commerce Committee are drafting. Congress has been expected to take up privacy legislation after California passed a strict privacy law that goes into effect next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner noted that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Google and others have expressed support for privacy regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The platform companies are now going to have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is, to see if they support this legislation and other approaches,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would bar companies from choosing groups of people for behavioral experiments unless the companies get informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the bill, social media companies would create a professional standards body to create best practices to deal with the issue. The Federal Trade Commission, which investigates deceptive advertising, would work with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Google, Twitter and other free online services rely on advertising for revenue, and use data collected on users to more effectively target those ads.The story refiles to fix typographical error in last paragraph to make it “rely” instead of “relay”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Aphantasia: &amp;#039;My mind&amp;#039;s eye is blind&amp;#039;</title>

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Pixar&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The former president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios says he has a &quot;blind mind's eye&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people can close their eyes and conjure up images inside their head such as counting sheep or imagining the face of a loved one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ed Catmull, 74, has the condition aphantasia, in which people cannot visualise mental images at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a surprising survey of his former employees, so do some of the world's best animators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed revolutionised 3D graphics, and the method he developed for animating curved surfaces became the industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He first realised his brain was different when trying to perform Tibetan meditation with a colleague. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visualisation is a core part of the practice and he was told to picture a sphere in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed told the BBC: &quot;I went home, closed my eyes… I couldn't see a thing and for an entire week I kept trying to visualise this sphere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke to colleagues and learned that some animators could form mental images so strong they would open their eyes and the image would still be there, so they could practically trace what they could see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed just thought: &quot;That's interesting, it's probably what makes them an artist.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Glen Keane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eventually Ed realised he was not alone and that, perhaps counter-intuitively, some of the greatest talents in animation could not visualise either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar-winner Glen Keane, who created Ariel (The Little Mermaid), also has no visual imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed told the BBC: &quot;He is truly extraordinary, he's one of the best animators in the history of hand-drawn animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[And] he said that he could never visualise either.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Glen Keane (right) won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball, alongside former NBA star Kobe Bryant.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Walt Disney, Glen Keane  &lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Glen Keane's early sketch of Ariel, the Little Mermaid.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;

                    Ariel in more recognisable form.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed said: &quot;When he first did The Little Mermaid, it's a bunch of scribbles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And then it converges, after he works on it for a while, into this gorgeous piece of art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And as far as he's concerned, that's the right way to work because it means he's looking deep down inside, for his emotions, and that's what drives his drawing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Origins of aphantasia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term aphantasia was coined by Prof Adam Zeman, from the University of Exeter Medical School, in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had documented a case of a man who lost his mind's eye in his 60s following a heart operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Zeman was then contacted by people who reported never having one and he described the condition as aphantasia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;in the journal Cortex.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one in 50 people is thought to have aphantasia, although exactly what is going on in the brain is still unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the brain from the frontal and parietal lobes are involved in visualisation and differences at any point in the system could be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wh.snapsurveys.com/s.asp?k=148940557153&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Take the aphantasia test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Pixar findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed, who co-founded Pixar, had a parting gift for his former employees when he left last year - a piece of homework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked 540 members of staff to take a test of the vividness of their visual imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sorted the results into: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;All staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Technical artists - who have a strong background in computer programming as well as artistry &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Artists - the animators, film designers or storyboard artists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Production managers - often people out of film school who organise the production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed that the artists were slightly better than technical artists at visualising, but the differences were not that huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was not a large skew, that's the real issue,&quot; said Ed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production managers were better than both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homework also revealed stark differences between two artists and good friends of Ed's who had worked on Frozen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can see an entire movie in his head and play it backwards and forwards and never needs to see a movie twice because he can visualise it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other cannot see anything at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Lessons from aphantasia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with aphantasia find it a cause of distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have described feeling isolated and alone after discovering that other people could see images in their heads and they could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed argues aphantasia is not a barrier to success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the BBC: &quot;I think the main message is, 'OK folks you can't use it as an excuse, you can still do good work, regardless of your differences'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And believes the study clears up misperceptions about the creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;People had conflated visualisation with creativity and imagination and one of the messages is, 'they're not the same thing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The other one I think that people might have assumed, but if you think about it you can see why it's false assumption, is you would think if a person could visualise, they're more likely to be able to draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you open your eyes and you take out a pencil and pad, how many people can draw what they see? The answer is a very small number, so if you can't draw what is in front of you then why would we expect that you would be able to draw what you visualise?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering he has aphantasia has also led to some insight into Ed's personal life, because his wife has very strong visual imagery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can remember their first date was in a park on the other side of the freeway and that is it. She can describe the whole area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Zeman, who has led research in the field of aphantasia, said: &quot;I think it's really helpful for people to know that the way they visualise - or not - doesn't define them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although we all have different thought processes, that doesn't link with the quality of what you produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just all go about it in different ways.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have aphantasia or hyperphantasia and would like to be involved in Prof Zeman's research he is happy to be contacted at a.zeman@exeter.ac.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow James &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesTGallagher&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;on Twitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
