<title>Hipmunk Says Goodbye</title>
<link>https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hipmunk-says-goodbye/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hipmunk-says-goodbye/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;single-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have important news to share.  After nine years of being a travel search innovator, Hipmunk is being retired. The current plan is to stop supporting the product on Jan. 23, 2020.  At that time, the Hipmunk website and app will no longer be available for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Hipmunk was acquired by SAP Concur.  As its approach to providing business travel solutions has evolved, SAP Concur has made the decision to retire the Hipmunk product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a travel metasearch, we helped travelers take the agony out of travel planning and gave SAP Concur a deeper understanding of how to develop innovations that meet the needs of today’s traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are grateful to all the travelers and partners that have joined us on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve included answers to the questions you most likely have below. If you have additional questions, our customer support team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.hipmunk.com/hc/en-us&quot;&gt;here to help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will happen to my account?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Concur Hipmunk has been retired, you will no longer be able to access your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about my reservations? Will my travel plans be canceled?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/meta-search-engine/&quot;&gt;travel metasearch&lt;/a&gt;, all bookings are held with the provider directly. Any reservations already made will not be impacted by this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions during this transition, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.hipmunk.com/hc/en-us&quot;&gt;help page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I access my trip data after Hipmunk is gone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any trip data stored on Hipmunk will no longer be available. However, if you made a booking on a partner site, you can reach out to the partner directly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox Multi-Account Containers</title>
<link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;About This Extension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a36f68b71d58a83b99fd6f69d3e51575f0cbe5861b5ad0664fea67cdaedcecf8/https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv=Gy7lyvAfOSw&quot;&gt;quick video&lt;/a&gt; showing you how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy in Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension does not send any information to Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this compare to the Facebook Container extension?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/&quot;&gt;Facebook Container&lt;/a&gt; specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container. This extension can be customized to suit your needs for multiple sites and multiple logins, but takes more time to set up than Facebook Container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3b0aa1a488ff9809554e48743a9b592944d358a0ffa3f88e394cd3ddfc36894b/http%3A//facebook.com&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3b0aa1a488ff9809554e48743a9b592944d358a0ffa3f88e394cd3ddfc36894b/http%3A//facebook.com&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3b0aa1a488ff9809554e48743a9b592944d358a0ffa3f88e394cd3ddfc36894b/http%3A//facebook.com&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I use both Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, but you need to be a little careful. Don't use Multi-Account Container to assign &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3b0aa1a488ff9809554e48743a9b592944d358a0ffa3f88e394cd3ddfc36894b/http%3A//facebook.com&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; to a Container, and then try installing Facebook Container. If you a Multi-Account Containers user and want to use both addons, unassign &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/3b0aa1a488ff9809554e48743a9b592944d358a0ffa3f88e394cd3ddfc36894b/http%3A//facebook.com&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/6264b7e35deffb61e631a63efa2756d1ec25fecdb1c8280e7572b3d7dc84bbc5/http%3A//messenger.com&quot;&gt;messenger.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/0a1ad749ccfa152292edbbd91f47c1a0d354403bfe748c2830c3f1b2be3daaaf/http%3A//instagram.com&quot;&gt;instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; first, then install Facebook Container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haven't I seen this in Firefox before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers was first introduced as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/ae82a64b843a1434352ba02e82c8060b1c45b237163d0f785b00d765d48e0f69/https%3A//blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;&quot;Containers&quot;&lt;/a&gt; available only in Firefox Nightly. It went on to be a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/439c378c0ee3ceda7d5c8b912339b8238207a4032e50f056a90e5243fc1f18f1/https%3A//testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers//&quot;&gt;Test Pilot Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, where we improved the user experience and added new features. Now it exists here as an extension that can be installed by all Firefox users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you can still use the feature built into Firefox Nightly, we recommend using this extension as it has a richer user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + . (period)&lt;/code&gt; keyboard shortcut is available to open the containers panel. You can then use tab and the enter keys to open new container tabs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Building a more private web: A path towards making third party cookies obsolete</title>
<link>https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html</guid>
<description>&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In August, we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a new initiative (known as Privacy Sandbox) to develop a set of open standards to fundamentally enhance privacy on the web. Our goal for this open source initiative is to make the web more private and secure for users, while also supporting publishers. Today, we’d like to give you an update on our plans and ask for your help in increasing the privacy of web browsing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After initial dialogue with the web community, we are confident that with continued iteration and feedback, privacy-preserving and open-standard mechanisms like the Privacy Sandbox can sustain a healthy, ad-supported web in a way that will render third-party cookies obsolete. Once these approaches have addressed the needs of users, publishers, and advertisers, and we have developed the tools to mitigate workarounds, we plan to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome. Our intention is to do this within two years. But we cannot get there alone, and that’s why we need the ecosystem to engage on these proposals. We plan to start the first origin trials by the end of this year, starting with conversion measurement and following with personalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users are demanding greater privacy--including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used--and it’s clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands. Some browsers have reacted to these concerns by blocking third-party cookies, but we believe this has unintended consequences that can negatively impact both users and the web ecosystem. By undermining the business model of many ad-supported websites, blunt approaches to cookies encourage the use of opaque techniques such as fingerprinting (an invasive workaround to replace cookies), which can actually reduce user privacy and control. We believe that we as a community can, and must, do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have received positive feedback in forums like the W3C that the mechanisms underlying the Privacy Sandbox represent key use-cases and go in the right direction. This feedback, and related proposals from other standards participants, gives us confidence that solutions in this space can work. And our experience working with the standards community to create alternatives and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phase out Flash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2014/11/the-final-countdown-for-npapi.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPAPI&lt;/a&gt; has proven that we can come together to solve complex challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll also continue our work to make current web technologies more secure and private. As we previously announced, Chrome will limit insecure cross-site tracking starting in February, by treating cookies that don’t include a SameSite label as first-party only, and require cookies labeled for third-party use to be accessed over HTTPS. This will make third-party cookies more secure and give users more precise browser cookie controls. At the same time, we’re developing techniques to detect and mitigate covert tracking and workarounds by launching new anti-fingerprinting measures to discourage these kinds of deceptive and intrusive techniques, and we hope to launch these measures later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working actively across the ecosystem so that browsers, publishers, developers, and advertisers have the opportunity to experiment with these new mechanisms, test whether they work well in various situations, and develop supporting implementations, including ad selection and measurement, denial of service (DoS) prevention, anti-spam/fraud, and federated authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking to build a more trustworthy and sustainable web together, and to do that we need your continued engagement. We encourage you to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/blob/master/README.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/community/web-adv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web standards community&lt;/a&gt; proposals via GitHub and make sure they address your needs. And if they don’t, file issues through GitHub or &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-adv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; the W3C group. If you rely on the web for your business, please ensure your technology vendors engage in this process and share your feedback with the trade groups that represent your interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue to keep everyone posted on the progress of efforts to increase the privacy of web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posted by Justin Schuh - Director, Chrome Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blink-Dev – Intent to Deprecate and Freeze: The User-Agent string</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/m/#!msg/blink-dev/-2JIRNMWJ7s/yHe4tQNLCgAJ</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contact emails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0);&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yoavweiss@chromium.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0);&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;aarontag@chromium.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We want to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;freeze and unify&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(but&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;not remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) the User Agent string in HTTP requests as well as in `navigator.userAgent`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Motivation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The User-Agent string is an abundant source of passive fingerprinting information about our users. It contains many details about the user’s browser and device as well as many lies (&quot;Mozilla/5.0&quot;, anyone?) that were or are needed for compatibility purposes, as servers grew reliant on bad User Agent sniffing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;On top of those privacy issues, User-Agent sniffing is an abundant source of compatibility issues, in particular for minority browsers, resulting in browsers lying about themselves (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/vivaldi-to-change-user-agent-string-to-chrome-due-to-unfair-blocking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;generally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;or to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/webcompat-addon/blob/master/src/injections/js/bug1472075-bankofamerica.com-ua-change.js&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;specific sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), and sites (including Google properties)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onmsft.com/news/google-has-apparently-blocked-its-stadia-cloud-gaming-service-on-the-chromium-based-microsoft-edge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;being broken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in some browsers for no good reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The above abuse makes it desirable to freeze the UA string and replace it with a better mechanism. There have been past attempts at UA string freezing from the Safari team, but without an alternative way to perform UA based content-negotiation, they had to be partially reverted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;User Agent Client Hints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UA-CH) feature provides an alternate source for the information the User-Agent string provides, both in its request header form as well as its JS API one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Its main advantages are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9.3574490889603&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4.7643097643098&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It provides the required information only when the server requests it, over secure connections, making any fingerprinting that relies on it be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;active fingerprinting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which enables such use to be audited, as well as acted-upon by the browser (e.g. in a future implementation of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Privacy Budget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It provides the information in small increments, so servers are only exposed to the information they need and request, rather than being exposed to the full gamut of the UA string even if they are just trying to figure out one detail about the browser. (e.g. brand and major version)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since it provides the information via dedicated fields, it enables better ergonomics and makes it less likely for servers to get it wrong and cause compatibility issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, starting fresh will enable us to drop a lot of the legacy baggage that the UA string carries (“Mozilla/5.0”, “like Gecko”, “like KHTML”, etc) going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/A4wxFpvqUfA/g7iccl9ICgAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UA-CH ships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as an alternative means for browser-specific content adaptation, we would like to freeze the User-Agent string. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We propose to deprecate at M81 (starting to emit console warnings in pages that read that string in JS), freeze its version information at M83, and unify strings of different devices at M85. See detailed freezing plan below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This timeline provides 3 months for developers to move to the new mechanism for their future browser and OS version needs, and 6 months for more sophisticated OS or device specific targeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Freezing plan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Different parts of the UA string have different compatibility implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some parts of it, such as the browser version and the OS version, can be frozen without any backwards compatibility implications. Values that worked in the past will continue to work in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other parts, such as the model (for mobile devices) and the OS platform, can have implications on sites that tailor their UI to the underlying OS or that target a very specific model in their layout. Such sites will need to migrate to use UA-CH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As such we are planning to freeze the parts that are amenable to freezing fairly early, and gradually unify the rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;84&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;127&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Milestone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stable date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;M81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mid March ‘20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deprecate access to `navigator.userAgent` &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;M83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early June ‘20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Freeze browser version and unify OS versions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;M85&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mid September ‘20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unify desktop OS string as a common value for desktop browsers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unify mobile OS/device strings as a similarly common value for those at M85 (*)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(*) For the mobile value, we may split it further based on common device dimensions, as a one-time exercise, to reduce the compatibility risk of unification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability and Compatibility Risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The compatibility risk varies at different stages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the freezing planned for M83, the compatibility risk is low. Existing UA sniffing code will continue to work as expected. It is only future UA sniffing code that will need to change and use the UA client hints instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the unification planned for M85, the compatibility risk is medium. Some sites can modify their responses based on the OS and device model, and those sites will have to change their UA sniffing code to use UA-CH. We expect such sites to be well maintained (otherwise, how can they keep up with OS UI and device model changes?). Therefore, having 4 releases to modify their code seems sufficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the long term, we expect this change to improve compatibility, as UA sniffing based on UA-CH is bound to be more reliable than the current status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for interoperability, we have other vendors on board with UA freezing, but not necessarily with the UA Client Hints mechanism, that is supposed to replace it. That can create a tricky situation, where developers would need to rely on the User-Agent string for some browsers and on UA-CH for others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edge:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_scottlow/status/1206831008261132289&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firefox:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/202#issuecomment-558294095&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for freezing the UA string - “freezing the User Agent string without any client hints—seems worth-prototyping”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Safari: Shipped to some extent. Safari has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmondello/status/943545865204989953&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;attempted to completely freeze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the UA string in the past, without providing an alternative mechanism. That got a lot of pushback, which resulted in somewhat reverting that decision. Nowadays, their UA string seems frozen, other than updates to the OS version and the browser major version.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alternative implementation suggestion for web developers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For many (most?) uses of UA sniffing today, a better tool for the job would be to use feature detection. Where feature detection fails developers,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UA Client Hints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;are the right path forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Potential deployment hurdles compared to status quo:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Third party services that rely on the UA string would need to convince the sites that include them to delegate that information to them using Feature Policy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The opt-in based mechanism of Client Hints currently suffers from the fact that on the very-first view, the browser have not yet received the opt-in. That means that requiring specific UA information (e.g. device model, platform) on the very-first navigation request may incur a delay. We are exploring options to enable the opt-in to happen further down the stack to avoid that delay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usage information from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/page/UseCounter.h&amp;amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;amp;type=cs&amp;amp;q=file:UseCounter.h%20Feature&amp;amp;l=39&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UseCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we were going to remove the User-Agent string outright, the answer to that would’ve been “a lot!!!!111”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given that we are planning to freeze it, we expect the “removal” to be mostly backwards compatible, barring cases of specific OS or device adaptation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/2663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Client-side UA sniffing use counters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;show it’s being used by ~90% of sites. But again, since we’re talking about freezing, it should not break most uses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was discovered in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Windows NT 4&quot;&gt;Windows NT 4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0#Service_Packs&quot; title=&quot;Windows NT 4.0&quot;&gt;Service Pack 5&lt;/a&gt; (which had been released unstripped of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_symbol&quot; title=&quot;Debug symbol&quot;&gt;symbolic debugging&lt;/a&gt; data) in August 1999 by Andrew D. Fernandes of Cryptonym Corporation.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system&quot; title=&quot;Operating system&quot;&gt;operating systems&lt;/a&gt; require all &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography&quot; title=&quot;Cryptography&quot;&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt; suites that work with its operating systems to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature&quot; title=&quot;Digital signature&quot;&gt;digital signature&lt;/a&gt;. Since only Microsoft-approved cryptography suites can be installed or used as a component of Windows, it is possible to keep export copies of this operating system (and products with Windows installed) in compliance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Administration_Regulations&quot; title=&quot;Export Administration Regulations&quot;&gt;Export Administration Regulations&lt;/a&gt; (EAR), which are enforced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Commerce&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;US Department of Commerce&quot;&gt;US Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security&quot; title=&quot;Bureau of Industry and Security&quot;&gt;Bureau of Industry and Security&lt;/a&gt; (BIS).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was already known that Microsoft used two keys, a primary and a spare, either of which can create valid signatures. Microsoft had failed to remove the debugging symbols in ADVAPI32.DLL, a security and encryption driver, when it released Service Pack 5 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0&quot; title=&quot;Windows NT 4.0&quot;&gt;Windows NT 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, and Andrew Fernandes, chief scientist with Cryptonym, found the primary key stored in the variable _KEY and the second key was labeled _NSAKEY.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Cryptonym_1-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-Cryptonym-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Fernandes published his discovery, touching off a flurry of speculation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory&quot; title=&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot;&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;, including the possibility that the second key was owned by the United States &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency&quot; title=&quot;National Security Agency&quot;&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (the NSA) and allowed the intelligence agency to subvert any Windows user's security.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-CNN_2-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-CNN-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a presentation at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers,_Freedom_and_Privacy_Conference&quot; title=&quot;Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference&quot;&gt;Computers, Freedom and Privacy&lt;/a&gt; 2000 (CFP2000) conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell_(investigative_journalist)&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, senior research fellow at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Privacy_Information_Center&quot; title=&quot;Electronic Privacy Information Center&quot;&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center&lt;/a&gt; (EPIC), mentioned the _NSAKEY controversy as an example of an outstanding issue related to security and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Dr. Nicko van Someren found  a third key in Windows 2000, which he doubted had a legitimate purpose, and declared that &quot;It looks more fishy&quot;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft denied the speculations on _NSAKEY. &quot;This report is inaccurate and unfounded. The key in question is a Microsoft key. It is maintained and safeguarded by Microsoft, and we have not shared this key with the NSA or any other party.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Microsoft said that the key's symbol was &quot;_NSAKEY&quot; because the NSA is the technical review authority for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States&quot; title=&quot;Export of cryptography from the United States&quot;&gt;U.S. cryptography export controls&lt;/a&gt;, and the key ensures compliance with U.S. export laws.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-NoBackdoor_5-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-NoBackdoor-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Purcell, Microsoft's Director of Corporate Privacy, approached Campbell after his presentation and expressed a wish to clear up the confusion and doubts about _NSAKEY. Immediately after the conference, Scott Culp, of the Microsoft Security Response Center, contacted Campbell and offered to answer his questions. Their correspondence began cordially but soon became strained; Campbell apparently felt Culp was being evasive and Culp apparently felt that Campbell was hostilely repeating questions that he had already answered. On 28 April 2000, Culp stated that &quot;we have definitely reached the end of this discussion ... [which] is rapidly spiraling into the realm of conspiracy theory&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Campbell's further inquiries went unanswered.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claimed the third key was only in beta builds of Windows 2000 and that its purpose was for signing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_Service_Provider&quot; title=&quot;Cryptographic Service Provider&quot;&gt;Cryptographic Service Providers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-NoBackdoor_5-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-NoBackdoor-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla&quot; title=&quot;Mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; page on common questions on cryptography mentions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is in fact possible under certain circumstances to obtain an export license for software invoking cryptographic functions through an API. For example, Microsoft's implementation of the Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) specification was approved for export from the US, even though it implements an API by which third parties, including third parties outside the US, can add separate modules (&quot;Cryptographic Service Providers&quot; or CSPs) implementing cryptographic functionality. This export approval was presumably made possible because a) the CryptoAPI implementation requires third party CSPs to be digitally signed by Microsoft and rejects attempts to call CSPs not so signed; b) through this signing process Microsoft can ensure compliance with the relevant US export control regulations (e.g., they presumably would not sign a CSP developed outside the US that implements strong cryptography); and c) Microsoft's CryptoAPI implementation is available only in executable form, and thus is presumed to be reasonably resistant to user tampering to disable the CSP digital signature check.&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-7&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Explanations_from_other_sources&quot;&gt;Explanations from other sources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some in the software industry question whether the BIS's EAR has specific requirements for backup keys. However, none claim the legal or technical expertise necessary to authoritatively discuss that document.  The following theories have been presented.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stated that the second key is present as a backup to guard against the possibility of losing the primary secret key. Fernandes doubts this explanation, pointing out that the generally accepted way to guard against loss of a secret key is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_splitting&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Secret splitting&quot;&gt;secret splitting&lt;/a&gt;, which would divide the key into several different parts, which would then be distributed throughout senior management.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-8&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He stated that this would be far more robust than using two keys; if the second key is also lost, Microsoft would need to patch or upgrade every copy of Windows in the world, as well as every cryptographic module it had ever signed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if Microsoft failed to think about the consequences of key loss and created a first key without using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_splitting&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Secret splitting&quot;&gt;secret splitting&lt;/a&gt; (and did so in secure hardware which doesn't allow protection to be weakened after key generation), and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;NSA&quot;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; pointed out this problem as part of the review process, it might explain why Microsoft weakened their scheme with a second key and why the new one was called _NSAKEY. (The second key might be backed up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_splitting&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Secret splitting&quot;&gt;secret splitting&lt;/a&gt;, so losing both keys needn't be a problem.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that Microsoft included a second key to be able to sign cryptographic modules outside the United States, while still complying with the BIS's EAR. If cryptographic modules were to be signed in multiple locations, using multiple keys is a reasonable approach. However, no cryptographic module has ever been found to be signed by _NSAKEY, and Microsoft denies that any other certification authority exists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft denied that the NSA has access to the _NSAKEY secret key.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-9&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was possible to remove the second _NSAKEY using the following (note this was for Windows software in 1999).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is good news among the bad, however. It turns out that there is a flaw in the way the &quot;crypto_verify&quot; function is implemented. Because of the way the crypto verification occurs, users can easily eliminate or replace the NSA key from the operating system without modifying any of Microsoft's original
components. Since the NSA key is easily replaced, it means that non-US companies are free to install &quot;strong&quot; crypto services into Windows, without Microsoft's or the NSA's approval. Thus the NSA has effectively removed export control of &quot;strong&quot; crypto from Windows. A demonstration program that replaces the NSA key can be found on Cryptonym's website.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-Cryptonym_1-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-Cryptonym-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 1999, an anonymous researcher reverse-engineered both the primary key and the _NSAKEY into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&quot; title=&quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;&gt;PGP&lt;/a&gt;-compatible format and published them to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_(cryptographic)&quot; title=&quot;Key server (cryptographic)&quot;&gt;key servers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-10&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY#cite_note-10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Machine keeps human livers alive for one week outside of the body</title>
<link>https://www.media.uzh.ch/en/Press-Releases/2020/Liver.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Until now, livers could be stored safely outside the body for only a few hours. With the novel perfusion technology, livers - and even injured livers - can now be kept alive outside of the body for an entire week. This is a major breakthrough in transplantation medicine, which may increase the number of available organs for transplantation and save many lives of patients suffering from severe liver disease or a variety of cancers.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Injured cadaveric livers, initially not suitable for use in transplantation, may regain full function while perfused in the new machine for several days. The basis for this technology is a complex perfusion system, mimicking most core body functions close to physiology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The corresponding study was published on 13 January in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Offering what other machines cannot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&quot;The success of this unique perfusion system - developed over a four-year period by a group of surgeons, biologists and engineers - paves the way for many new applications in transplantation and cancer medicine helping patients with no liver grafts available,&quot; explains Prof. Pierre-Alain Clavien, Chairman of the Department of Surgery and Transplantation at the UniversityHospital Zurich (USZ). When the project started in 2015, livers could only be kept  on the machine for 12 hours. The seven-day successful perfusion of poor-quality livers now allows for a wide range of strategies, e.g. repair of preexisting injury, cleaning of fat deposits in the liver or even regeneration of partial livers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Liver4Life: A project from Wyss Zurich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Liver4Life project was developed under the umbrella of Wyss Zurich institute, which brought together the highly specialized technical know-how and biomedical knowledge of experts from the UniversityHospital Zurich (USZ), ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich (UZH). &quot;The biggest challenge in the initial phase of our project was to find a common language that would allow communication between the clinicians and engineers,&quot; explains Prof. Philipp Rudolf von Rohr, professor of process engineering at ETH Zurich and co-leader with professor Clavien of the study now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology with great potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

The next step will be to use these organs for transplantation. The proposed technology opens a large avenue for many applications offering a new life for many patients with end-stage liver disease or cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;header class=&quot;article__header article__header--inline&quot; readability=&quot;25.588235294118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/author/charles-piller&quot;&gt;Charles Piller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Jan. 13, 2020 , 11:00 AM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 20 years, the U.S. government has urged companies, universities, and other institutions that conduct clinical trials to record their results in a federal database, so doctors and patients can see whether new treatments are safe and effective. Few trial sponsors have consistently done so, even after a 2007 law made posting mandatory for many trials registered in the database. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tried again, enacting a long-awaited “final rule” to clarify the law’s expectations and penalties for failing to disclose trial results. The rule took full effect 2 years ago, on 18 January 2018, giving trial sponsors ample time to comply. But a &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; investigation shows that many still ignore the requirement, while federal officials do little or nothing to enforce the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; examined more than 4700 trials whose results should have been posted on the NIH website ClinicalTrials.gov under the 2017 rule. Reporting rates by most large pharmaceutical companies and some universities have improved sharply, but performance by many other trial sponsors—including, ironically, NIH itself—was lackluster. Those sponsors, typically either the institution conducting a trial or its funder, must deposit results and other data within 1 year of completing a trial. But of 184 sponsor organizations with at least five trials due as of 25 September 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/clinical-scofflaws&quot;&gt;30 companies, universities, or medical centers never met a single deadline&lt;/a&gt;. As of that date, those habitual violators had failed to report any results for 67% of their trials and averaged 268 days late for those and all trials that missed their deadlines. They included such eminent institutions as the Harvard University–affiliated Boston Children’s Hospital, the University of Minnesota, and Baylor College of Medicine—all among the top 50 recipients of NIH grants in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violations cover trials in virtually all fields of medicine, and the missing or late results offer potentially vital information for the most desperate patients. For example, in one long-overdue trial, researchers compared the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens in 200 patients with advanced lymphoma; another—nearly 2 years late—tests immunotherapy against conventional chemotherapy in about 600 people with late-stage lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other leading NIH grantees did only slightly better in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis based on data collected from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/&quot;&gt;TrialsTracker website&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Oxford, which automatically mines information from ClinicalTrials.gov. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Mayo Clinic both failed to report results on time, or at all, in about two-thirds of their trials. Yale University failed to do so in 84% of its trials. NIH’s own institutes also had a bad record. They are directly responsible for reporting results when they sponsor studies done by agency staff or some grantees, and the top four NIH institute sponsors, taken together, reported results late or not at all in more than six of every 10 trials &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contacted for comment, none of the institutions disputed the findings of this investigation. In all 4768 trials &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; checked, sponsors violated the reporting law more than 55% of the time. And in hundreds of cases where the sponsors got credit for reporting trial results, they have yet to be publicly posted because of quality lapses flagged by ClinicalTrials.gov staff (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/fda-and-nih-let-clinical-trial-sponsors-keep-results-secret-and-break-law#sidebar&quot;&gt;see sidebar&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the 2017 rule, and officials’ statements at the time, promised aggressive enforcement and stiff penalties, neither NIH nor FDA has cracked down. FDA now says it won’t brandish its big stick—penalties of up to $12,103 a day for failing to report a trial’s results—until after the agency issues further “guidance” on how it will exercise that power. It has not set a date. NIH said at a 2016 briefing on the final rule that it would cut off grants to those who ignore the trial reporting requirements, as authorized in the 2007 law, but so far has not done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;figure__hed&quot;&gt;Missed deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among more than 4700 clinical trials examined by &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, less than 45% had their results reported early or on time to ClinicalTrials.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150631.6% Not reported 113223.7% 213044.7% Reported ontime or early Reported late&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(GRAPHIC) N. DESAI/&lt;cite&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/cite&gt;; (DATA) CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, VIA TRIALSTRACKER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists who conduct clinical trials, and their sponsors or funders, have downplayed concerns about late or missing results in ClinicalTrials.gov. Researchers, doctors, and patients can instead learn about trial outcomes from peer-reviewed publications, they say. But thousands of trials are never published, particularly when they find treatments ineffective, history has shown. ClinicalTrials.gov also uses a common format, allowing relatively easy comparisons of results across trials that journal articles rarely make possible. Doctors, researchers, and potential trial participants rely on the site, to judge from its 215 million monthly page views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Zarin, a physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard who headed ClinicalTrials.gov between 2005 and 2018, says the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;findings show failures of the research culture, FDA, and NIH. “If this was a priority for the leadership of NIH, then they could ensure that high-quality, timely reporting happened all of the time,” says Zarin, an NIH-paid research consultant for the database. “You can set up processes so trial reporting is an expectation. You can’t pass ‘go’ and collect $200 until this is done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zarin, who works in a program to advance clinical research, adds that the problem persists because “reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov is frequently seen by sponsors, funders, and trialists as an annoying administrative and perhaps legal burden, not a scientific imperative. Human nature being what it is, people follow the requirements when forced to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIH and FDA officials do not seem inclined to apply that pressure. Lyric Jorgenson, NIH deputy director for science policy, says her agency has been “trying to change the culture of how clinical trial results are reported and disseminated; not so much on the ‘aha, we caught you,’ as much as getting people to understand the value, and making it as easy as possible to share and disseminate results.” To that end, she says, ClinicalTrials.gov staff have educated researchers about the website and improved its usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for FDA, Patrick McNeilly, an official at the agency who handles trial enforcement matters, recently told an industry conference session on ClinicalTrials.gov that “FDA has limited resources, and we encourage voluntary compliance.” He said the agency also reviews reporting of information on ClinicalTrials.gov as part of inspections of trial sites, or when it receives complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNeilly declined an interview request, but at the conference he discounted violations of ClinicalTrials.gov reporting requirements found by journalists and watchdog groups. “We’re not going to blanketly accept an entire list of trials that people say are noncompliant,” he said. Such determinations require “nonpublic information” submitted to the agency by trial sponsors. In response to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, a spokesperson said an absence of posted results on ClinicalTrials.gov did not mean a trial sponsor has broken the 2007 law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet that law and the 2017 final rule detail only a few exemptions that would allow trial sponsors to withhold results on the basis of nonpublic information. The very few registered trials that qualify for those exemptions are not flagged as violators by TrialsTracker or in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-break-style&quot;&gt;Congress approved the creation of&lt;/span&gt; ClinicalTrials.gov in 1997, after allegations that patients were harmed because companies withheld evidence showing their medicines were ineffective or hazardous. A widely cited case involved the GlaxoSmithKline antidepressant Paxil (paroxetine). According to legal filings and a report in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, the firm held secret data showing that in clinical trials the drug was ineffective and caused suicidal thoughts in teenagers, yet encouraged doctors to prescribe it for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;figure__hed&quot;&gt;Related content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration was only required initially for trials of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases. But the 2007 law, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, required sponsors to register a much broader range of trials within 21 days of enrolling the first patient, and to post summary results, adverse events, and other data to ClinicalTrials.gov within 1 year of collecting the last patient data. Although many trials, such as industry-sponsored early-stage evaluations of drug safety, are exempt from reporting, about 326,000 have been registered, and results have been posted for more than 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet until 2015, even the most active investigators at clinical research institutions treated the law more as a suggestion—not surprising given that the government enforced no penalties and did not publicly identify violators. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/13/clinical-trials-investigation/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the news website &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; by this author and Talia Bronshtein first drew significant attention to specific trial sponsors—companies, government agencies, universities, and individuals—that routinely ignored reporting requirements. It sparked immediate improvement, according to NIH. (Those same authors documented some of that improvement in a 2018 &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/09/clinical-trials-reporting-nih/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a 2016 press briefing, NIH and FDA rolled out the final rule, aimed at boosting even greater compliance with the 2007 law. It took effect in January 2017, with first deadlines for results, and ostensibly enforcement, 1 year later. Then–FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said it would thereafter “be pretty hard to hide that you are doing a clinical trial or hide the result.” FDA, he vowed, was finally prepared, if necessary, to enforce the daily $10,000 penalty for noncompliance allowed under the law. (Adjusted for inflation, that figure recently rose above $12,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think anybody wants to be on the wall of shame,” NIH Director Francis Collins said at the press event, promising that NIH would publicly flag reporting violations on ClinicalTrials.gov itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are serious about this,” Collins said, threatening for the first time to enforce provisions of the 2007 law that allow NIH to rescind funding to grantees who violate the statute. “It’s hard to herd cats, but you can … take their food away,” he said. “This is about maintaining the trust that we have with participants in clinical trials. … If we fail to live up to that expectation, then that is an ethical failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years later, TrialsTracker conservatively estimates that FDA could have collected more than $6 billion in ClinicalTrials.gov penalties so far. The agency has yet to demand a single dollar. And despite more than 2600 trials for which results are overdue or were filed late, NIH has yet to withhold a single grant as a result or post a single violation notice on ClinicalTrials.gov. No “wall of shame” exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public-facing websites run by the government should be accurate. That’s not asking much,” Senator Chuck Grassley (R–IA), who advocated for the 2007 law, wrote in an email after reviewing a summary of the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; findings. “It’s a question of basic management and agency competence. The government has a duty to police its work product, especially because the public trusts .gov websites will be accurate and reliable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To physician Ben Goldacre, who directs the Oxford program behind TrialsTracker, “The lack of urgency is really troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;figure__hed&quot;&gt;Reporting problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; analyzed ClinicalTrials.gov records of all clinical trials with results legally required to be reported between 18 January 2018 and 25 September 2019. The chart, covering trial sponsors with 15 or more results due in that window or reported early, shows that some results deposited were not posted due to quality lapses. It also highlights that pharma’s record has been markedly better than that of academia and the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-break-style&quot;&gt;In a recent article in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt;, Goldacre&lt;/span&gt; and colleagues highlighted a long-running MD Anderson trial as an example of what’s at stake when clinical research results go AWOL. Started in 1999, the trial tested a specialized hormone therapy in patients who had surgery for prostate cancer and faced a high risk of recurrence. The treatment might reduce that risk significantly, but other trials suggested it had serious side effects, including reduced bone density, sexual dysfunction, and greater risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events. When &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; collected the ClinicalTrials.gov data, the MD Anderson trial’s results were overdue by 1 year and 8 months without explanation, and no journal appears to have published them. Doctors and prostate cancer patients weighing the most appropriate treatment have been left in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hahn, who served as chief medical officer at MD Anderson until last month, when he became the new FDA commissioner, was unavailable for comment. An MD Anderson spokesperson said the center “believes in transparency,” and is making “every effort to comply” with trial reporting rules, but did not respond to a question on the missing cancer trial data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo, Yale, the University of Minnesota, Baylor, and Boston Children’s, which have similarly poor reporting records, all said via email that they, too, were committed to fulfilling ClinicalTrials.gov requirements. Mayo said it deployed dedicated staff to assist researchers. Yale noted it had registered hundreds of trials exempt from reporting requirements and added a layer of review to help ensure compliance. The University of Minnesota recently created a monitoring system and has made rapid progress on reporting, according to a spokesperson. Baylor said it planned to centralize trial monitoring, as “a top priority.” Boston Children’s said it was “committed to achieving 100% compliance.” It submitted data for one long-overdue study after being contacted by &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, but four others remain in apparent violation as of the end of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow, apparently forgiving regulatory approach favored by NIH and FDA will never force such organizations into full compliance, some advocates of clinical trial transparency say. “In an era when every restaurant is obliged to publish on its front door the hygiene rating in their kitchen, we’re seriously not saying whether a trial that costs millions of dollars has broken the law and its obligation to … patient participants by failing to report its results?” Goldacre asks. “That seems like extraordinary special treatment for clinical trialists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select institutions have made serious efforts to comply. Twenty big pharma companies met all reporting requirements under the 2017 rule and some major academic centers improved sharply compared with data collected in 2017 (as detailed in the second &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; investigation). Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Duke University, and Johns Hopkins University—poor performers in 2017—complied with the law in nearly all their registered trials covered by the new rule. Johns Hopkins added staff to track and assist on reporting and to identify “problem records.” And it enlisted university executives to crack down on recalcitrant investigators, according to Anthony Keyes, a clinical research manager there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such good performance shouldn’t be an exception, Harvard's Zarin says. “Further public accountability of the trialists, but also our government organizations, has to happen. One possibility is that FDA and NIH will be shamed into enforcing the law. Another possibility is that sponsors will be shamed into doing a better job. A third possibility is that ClinicalTrials.gov will never fully achieve its vital aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;
