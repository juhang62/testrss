<title>Great White Sharks Are Terrified of Orcas</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;99.603037974684&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much common wisdom that the top predator in the ocean is the great white shark (that is, if there isn’t a remnant population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/articles/real-science-megalodon-180969860/&quot;&gt;megalodon&lt;/a&gt; hidden somewhere in the deep). But a new study reveals that the massive shark is not the ocean’s top apex predator: that title rightly belongs to orcas, also known as killer whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revelation comes from a paper in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39356-2&quot;&gt;Nature Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by senior research scientist Salvador Jorgensen at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and his colleagues. Ed Yong at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/great-white-sharks-flee-killer-whales/587563/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that over the years, while studying great white sharks, Jorgensen and his team began to notice that when killer whales entered the scene, the sharks made an exit, and in many cases did not return for months. In particular, in 2009 the team radio-tagged 17 sharks around Southeast Farallon Island in &lt;a href=&quot;https://farallones.noaa.gov/&quot;&gt;Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a marine and wildlife refuge off the coast of California. The sharks happily munched on young elephant seals in the waters around the island, which they regularly do between September and December. But when a pod of orcas entered the waters for just a couple of hours, the sharks high-tailed it out of there and most didn’t return that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand if that situation was common or the whole thing was a fluke, Jorgensen and his team looked deeper in the data, examining information about 165 great white sharks tagged in the Farallones between 2006 and 2013. They compared that with whale, shark and seal surveys collected in the marine sanctuary collected over 27 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was a standard pattern. When orca whales entered the area, the sharks bolted from Southeast Farallon and nearby islands. “When confronted by orcas, white sharks will immediately vacate their preferred hunting ground and will not return for up to a year, even though the orcas are only passing through,” Jorgensen says in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2019-04-white-sharks-areas-orcas.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Sloat at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/55033-great-white-sharks-scared-of-orcas&quot;&gt;Inverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that if the whales get within two miles of the islands, the sharks will pack up and leave. In an average year, researchers are able to document 40 elephant seals eaten by sharks. But in years where the orcas make an appearance, which they did in 2009, 2011 and 2013, that number drops by 62 percent from the previous year. For the seals it can be a win-win situation. If the whales simply pass by and don’t stop to snack but still clear out the sharks, the young seals can chase fish in relative security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are the sharks, which can grow up to 18 feet long, so afraid of orcas? Yong reports that most of what we know about white shark/orca encounters doesn’t end well for the sharks. In 1997, during the first interaction ever recorded, fishermen near Southeast Farallon witnessed a pair of orcas kill a young great white that tried to nose in on the sea lion they were eating. The orcas bashed him to death then ate his liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/this-could-be-why-orcas-have-been-eating-great-white-sh-1797192681&quot;&gt;five corpses of great white sharks&lt;/a&gt; washed up on the beaches of South Africa, all with their livers almost surgically removed. It was the work of orcas, which kill the sharks then make a wound near the calorie-dense shark liver. They then squish the yummy treat out of the shark and leave the rest of the corpse. “It’s like squeezing toothpaste,” Jorgensen tells Yong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are beginning to understand how the instinct to avoid predators creates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/how-landscape-fear-transformed-ecosystem-african-wildlife-park&quot;&gt;“landscape of fear”&lt;/a&gt; that can have wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems. This new study shows that the concept also applies in the oceans. “We don't typically think about how fear and risk aversion might play a role in shaping where large predators hunt and how that influences ocean ecosystems,” Jorgensen says in the press release. “It turns out these risk effects are very strong even for large predators like white sharks—strong enough to redirect their hunting activity to less preferred but safer areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just hope those safer hunting grounds aren’t too close to shore.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Lesson to Unlearn</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/the-lesson-to-unlearn-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;182&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;The Lesson to Unlearn&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;December 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning completely dominated actual learning in college. I was fairly earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took, and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was studying for a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase &quot;studying for a test&quot; was almost redundant, because that was when one really studied. The difference between diligent and slack students was that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't. No one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence has a &quot;though&quot; in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades? Yes, it is bad. And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad. Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late. The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly hackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know it so well they've ceased even to question it. You'll see when you realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time, if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it, and do well on the exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves. If you merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you learned wouldn't be on the test. It's not good books you want to read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class. And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question. You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort of thing that could be turned into a test question. But if the professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or consequences is beside the point. For the purposes of this class they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around, and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them. After teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least inadvertently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you can't blame students if they choose grades. Everyone judges them by their grades —graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even their own parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to college to do badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game, or they'll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities, that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about getting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place. The result is that students compete to maximize the difference between learning and getting good grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable? Any experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable is software whose author hasn't paid any attention to preventing it from being hacked? Usually it's as porous as a colander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. The reason the tests you're given are so consistently bad —so consistently far from measuring what they're supposed to measure — is simply that the people creating them haven't made much effort to prevent them from being hacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can't blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their job is to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is grades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If grades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they were doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete, students wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately after a certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age, whenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've used college tests as an example, but those are actually the least hackable. All the tests most students take their whole lives are at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the test that gets them into college. If getting into college were merely a matter of having the quality of one's mind measured by admissions officers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we could tell teenage kids &quot;learn a lot&quot; and leave it at that. You can tell how bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike high school that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature of the stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly proportionate to the hackability of college admissions. The classes you don't care about that are mostly memorization, the random &quot;extracurricular activities&quot; you have to participate in to show you're &quot;well-rounded,&quot; the standardized tests as artificial as chess, the &quot;essay&quot; you have to write that's presumably meant to hit some very specific target, but you're not told what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad in the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industries have grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prep companies and admissions counsellors, but it's also a significant part of the function of private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of what it's measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to get into a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers at elite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that. What are they looking for? They're looking for people who are not simply smart, but admirable in some more general sense. And how is this more general admirableness measured? The admissions officers feel it. In other words, they accept who they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the taste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that is going to be hackable. And because it's both very hackable and there's (thought to be) a lot at stake, it's hacked like nothing else. That's why it distorts your life so much for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape of their lives is completely artificial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system does to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way to win is by hacking bad tests. This is a much subtler problem that I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially young ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to make things overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money? What's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in you? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain, is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs into investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too. You're investing time in the same company you're asking them to invest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even doing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, they'd say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation, they'd ask: What makes a startup a good investment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not just in the eyes of investors but in fact, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/growth.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;growth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally in revenue, but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about that. They needed to do a big launch that would get them &quot;exposure.&quot; They needed influential people to talk about them. They even knew they needed to launch on a tuesday, because that's when one gets the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The way you get lots of users is to make the product really great. Then people will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, so your growth will be exponential once you &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;get it started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I've told the founders something you'd think would be completely obvious: that they should make a good company by making a good product. And yet their reaction would be something like the reaction many physicists must have had when they first heard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment at its apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything so weird couldn't possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully. And could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? And remember, we want to launch on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons. And not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blind to what was right in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated? And then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates, had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking the test. That's why the conversation would always start with how to raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the end of YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed to be better. It must be the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to win is to hack the test. This phenomenon isn't limited to schools. And some people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this is true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most striking things about startups is the degree to which you win by simply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in anything, but in general you win by getting users, and what users care about is whether the product does what they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startups overcomplicated? Because I hadn't realized explicitly that schools train us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me! I'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. For example, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you'd asked why, I'd have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic. Or just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of big companies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot of what attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn't realized that explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had in effect achieved by successive approximations something that may have a closed-form solution. I had gradually undone my training in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it. Could someone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing its name, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to make things better, because much of its power comes from the fact that we take it for granted. After you've noticed it, it seems the elephant in the room, but it's a pretty well camouflaged elephant. The phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it's simply the result of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is just what happens when you combine learning with grades, competition, and the naive assumption of unhackability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I'd puzzled about the most — the bogusness of high school, and the difficulty of getting founders to see the obvious — both had the same cause. It's rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of different areas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggests both that education could be done better, and how you might fix it. But it also suggests a potential answer to the question all big companies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I'm not going to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focus on here is what it means for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating from college have something they may want to unlearn. But it also changes how you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the different kinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or less appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that will sort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at this kind of work by hacking bad tests?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly. Is there a pattern here? It turns out there is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed by authorities, and those that aren't. Tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one is claiming they're tests of anything more than they actually test. A football match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not which team is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentators sometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas tests imposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. A test in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you did on that particular test, but how much you learned in the class. While tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently unhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable. Usually they aren't. So as a first approximation, bad tests are roughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumably some people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doing this kind of work don't like it. They just take it for granted that this is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and be some kind of hippie artisan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in a field with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that, I can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentieth century, when the economy was &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/re.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;composed of oligopolies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the only way to the top was by playing their game. But it's not true now. There are now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that's part of the reason people are so much more excited about getting rich than they used to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineer and make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an &quot;executive.&quot; Now you can make lots of money by making cool things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between work and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the most important trends happening now, and we see its effects in almost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the most visible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writers no longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers; now they can go direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get. This seems one of those situations where we don't realize how much something was holding us back until it's eliminated. And I can foresee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens as more and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win by hacking bad tests, and decide that they don't. The kinds of work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent, and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx of the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks in importance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it. Imagine what the world could look like if that happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for society to unlearn, and we'll be amazed at the energy that's liberated when we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly utopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda School. Lambda School doesn't have grades. You either graduate or you don't. The only purpose of tests is to decide at each stage of the curriculum whether you can continue to the next. So in effect the whole school is pass/fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] If the final exam consisted of a long conversation with the professor, you could prepare for it by reading good books on medieval history. A lot of the hackability of tests in schools is due to the fact that the same test has to be given to large numbers of students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3] Learning is the naive algorithm for getting good grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4] &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/gba.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hacking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has multiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which it means to compromise something. That's the sense in which one hacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning to find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking differently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing. And indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively ingenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because the tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[5] The people who pick startups at Y Combinator are similar to admissions officers, except that instead of being arbitrary, their acceptance criteria are trained by a very tight feedback loop. If you accept a bad startup or reject a good one, you will usually know it within a year or two at the latest, and often within a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6] I'm sure admissions officers are tired of reading applications from kids who seem to have no personality beyond being willing to seem however they're supposed to seem to get accepted. What they don't realize is that they are, in a sense, looking in a mirror. The lack of authenticity in the applicants is a reflection of the arbitrariness of the application process. A dictator might just as well complain about the lack of authenticity in the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[7] By good work, I don't mean morally good, but good in the sense in which a good craftsman does good work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[8] There are borderline cases where it's hard to say which category a test falls in. For example, is raising venture capital like college admissions, or is it like selling to a customer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[9] Note that a good test is merely one that's unhackable. Good here doesn't mean morally good, but good in the sense of working well. The difference between fields with bad tests and good ones is not that the former are bad and the latter are good, but that the former are bogus and the latter aren't. But those two measures are not unrelated. As Tara Ploughman said, the path from good to evil goes through bogus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[10] People who think the recent increase in &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;economy inequality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is due to changes in tax policy seem very naive to anyone with experience in startups. Different people are getting rich now than used to, and they're getting much richer than mere tax savings could make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[11] Note to tiger parents: you may think you're training your kids to win, but if you're training them to win by hacking bad tests, you are, as parents so often do, training them to fight the last war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When the European Union adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;new copyright directive&lt;/a&gt;, including its infamous Article 17, the upload filtering provision, it gave Member States time until June 2021 to introduce the new rules into their national copyright laws. France, the most fervent supporter of Article 17, apparently has no time to lose and just presented the new draft law designed to transpose Article 17 and some other parts of the copyright directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France’s implementation proposal is important to follow wherever you are in the EU, because it likely marks the worst-case scenario of how Article 17 could unfold if rightsholders get their way. Given that the French government has been the mouthpiece of the entertainment industry throughout the negotiations, perhaps one should not be surprised that it tries to interpret the new rules in the way most favorable to rightsholders. After all, president Emmanuel Macron personally intervened with Angela Merkel to secure Germany’s support for Article 17 in clear breach of the German coalition government agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the audacity with which the proposed French law ignores the safeguards included in the EU copyright directive to protect user rights should be baffling even to the most cynical commentator. The proposal needs to be adopted by the French legislator, so there is still a chance to improve it, but given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2019/04/copyright-final-vote/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the vast majority of French Members of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; from different parties across the political spectrum voted for the EU directive, there is likely to be broad support for the national proposal as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultural Sovereignty !?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new draft law on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/16062/162304/version/1/file/plf_mice1927829L_cm_5.12.2019.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“audiovisual communication and cultural sovereignty in the digital age”&lt;/a&gt; covers a number of different subjects aside from copyright law, including the protection of minors and the regulation of video streaming platforms like Netflix. The title of the proposed law gives a glimpse into the mindset of French legislators, presenting the enforcement of copyright laws in the interest of private entertainment companies as a matter of asserting France’s “cultural sovereignty”. It frames Article 17 as a means to support the European entertainment industry in its conflicts with American tech companies. Users’ interests are at best an afterthought in this struggle for “cultural sovereignty”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post examines the part of the proposal which implements Article 17 of the Directive on copyright in the digital single market (found on pages 28 to 34 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/16062/162304/version/1/file/plf_mice1927829L_cm_5.12.2019.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;draft law&lt;/a&gt;). That part is divided into four sections, dealing with platform definition, platform obligations, transparency and user rights. The last section is a bit of a misnomer, because it ignores the vast majority of user rights included in Article 17 of the EU copyright directive, which were introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2019/04/not-in-vain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;in response to the massive protests&lt;/a&gt; against the potentially devastating effects of Article 17 on fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Platform Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite assertions by supporters of Article 17 that the law is aimed at huge social media companies like YouTube and Facebook, the French proposal still tries to extend the new obligations to as many platforms as possible. The definition included in section 1 of the proposal is mostly identical to the definition included in the EU copyright directive, which has been criticized for being exceedingly vague. No effort is made to narrow down what is meant by unclear terms from the directive such as “large amounts” of copyrighted content uploaded to a platform. Instead, the French law provides that a decree should define what is considered a large amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one important change: The definition does not just include platforms that profit directly from user uploads of copyrighted content, but also those that do so indirectly. That could include platforms whose business model is not based on giving access to user uploads of copyrighted content (for example by placing advertisements next to that content), but who nevertheless allow such uploads. One example could be the dating app Tinder, which is based on a freemium business model, where users can pay for extra functionality which gives their dating profiles greater visibility. These profits are clearly not directly derived from giving users access to copyright-protected content, yet without the possibility to upload copyrighted content (pictures), the app clearly would not function, so it could be argued that it derives its profits indirectly from organizing the uploaded pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU directive does mention indirect profit in the recitals, which are not legally binding, but not in the legal definition. It seems that the French government cherry-picks from the recitals, ignoring the guidance that is supposed to narrow down the definition and only including the parts that widen it. For example, the clarification from the recitals that Article 17 should only apply to platforms that compete with licensed content streaming services for the same audiences (which would clearly exclude platforms like Tinder) is completely missing from the French law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Platform obligations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the proposal, section 2, is mostly identical to the provisions of the directive. Platforms that fall under the definition established in section 1 are directly liable for copyright infringements by their users, unless the platform can show that it did everything in its power to obtain a license from the rightsholder and to block unauthorized user uploads of copyrighted content identified to the platform by rightsholders. Lighter obligations exist for startups that are less than three years old, as described in the EU directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French draft law clarifies that rightsholders should be completely free in deciding whether to give a license to a platform, shutting down any efforts such as those discussed in Germany to avoid upload filters by introducing some kind of mandatory licensing solution. Whenever a rightsholder decides not to offer a platform a license, it will therefore have to use upload filters. This is particularly interesting given that the German government announced that it would try to cooperate with other European countries to try to find a solution that doesn’t rely on upload filters. France, one of the largest EU Member States, is clearly not interested in such a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-tdm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6793&quot; src=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-tdm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;230&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; srcset=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-tdm.png 230w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/copyright-icon-tdm-150x150.png 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 3 includes some transparency obligations that platforms have towards rightsholders (not towards users, of course!) about the types of measures used to block unauthorized content. The main difference to the EU directive is that the French proposal makes it clear that platforms do not have to reveal any &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2016/04/trade-secrets-rules-open-the-door-to-abuse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;trade secrets&lt;/a&gt; in order to comply with the transparency obligations. This addition could severely limit the chances of the public to inspect upload filters used by private companies for potential fundamental rights issues, as companies will declare the detailed functioning of their upload filters a trade secret. Apparently, the only thing that France loves more than giving authors to right to stop the flow of information is to give companies the right to stop the flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part of this section that’s faithful to the directive is the title. Remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@EuropeanCommission/https-medium-com-europeancommission-no-no-no-we-are-not-banning-memes-copyright-proposal-abf4d21f65d2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the European Commission claimed that your memes will be safe&lt;/a&gt;? Memes would not be deleted, the Commission argued, because Article 17 makes the exceptions for parody, caricature, pastiche and quotation mandatory and clarifies that Member States have to make sure that users can benefit from these exceptions in practice. It also states that platforms cannot be forced to generally monitor all user uploads (which is necessary for any upload filter) and that legal uploads must not be deleted as a consequence of implementing Article 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, France “forgot” to mention all of that in its national proposal. The copyright exceptions under French law stay completely unchanged, although they are notoriously patchy and do not cover all situations that may arise on online platforms, such as quoting from a video. France also completely fails to ensure that users can benefit from these exceptions in practice when they upload something to a platform. Instead of ensuring that platforms do not override existing copyright exceptions in their terms and conditions, as the directive requires, the French proposal simply asks platforms to inform users about the existence of copyright exceptions under national law. The decisive parts of Article 17, which state that platforms must allow users to actually benefit from these exceptions, and that such legal content must not be blocked in the first place, are completely missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from the creatively named “user rights” section of the draft law that copyrighted content gets blocked by default and users can only benefit from copyright exceptions if they complain after their content has already been blocked. Of course, getting your reaction gif or live stream unblocked a couple of days after the fact is completely useless, which explains why very few users ever make use of such complaint mechanisms where they exist. Under the French proposal, platforms have to offer a mechanism to deal with user complaints about blocked content (so the procedure is clearly “block first, ask questions later”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rightsholders, unlike what the directive says, do not have to justify their initial requests to block content, but only have to respond once a user challenges the blocking of one of their uploads. During this dispute resolution, the content stays blocked. This opens the door to copyfraud, where companies falsely claim to hold rights in other people’s creations, and the original author has to complain to have their own work unblocked. Although the directive says that all decisions by a platform to block content must be subject to human review, the French proposal only requires this in cases where a user complains after their content has already been blocked. &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/09/when-filters-fail/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Outrageous mistakes by fully automated upload filters&lt;/a&gt; are likely to become a lot more common under this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, when users or rightsholders want to complain about the result of the redress mechanism offered by the platform, they are supposed to turn to a new regulator called ARCOM, which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;direct successor of HADOPI&lt;/a&gt;, the organization best known for administering the infamous “three strikes” rule, which could block users from accessing the Internet if they repeatedly violated copyright law. This is hardly a regulator that is known for impartially weighing the competing interests of users and rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copyright Fight: Round 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French draft law confirms the worst fears of the EU copyright directive’s critics. The strictest version of the upload filter provision is proposed, while any safeguards that have been introduced to respond to the huge public protests are simply ignored. It’s hard to imagine that such a selective implementation of an EU directive would be accepted by the courts, but before it could come to a lawsuit, a lot of damage would already be done. Smaller countries often tend to copy the national implementations of EU law proposed by the larger countries, so there is a significant danger that France could set the standard for copyright enforcement in the entire EU. The European Commission should remind the French government of its obligation to implement the entire directive, not just the part that benefit large entertainment companies. With a French Commissioner in charge of copyright issues in the new European Commission, however, that is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore once again upon the users to raise the alarm bells on this most dangerous version of Article 17 yet! The French parliament can still stop this law from advancing as proposed. We must also pressure other European governments not to follow this terrible example and take user rights seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/brave-launches-next-generation-browser/&quot;&gt;Brave 1.0&lt;/a&gt; was released on November 13th and received very positive press reviews, and also saw a surge in user adoption. Brave went from 8.7 million monthly active users in October to 10.4 million MAU at the end of November, a 19% increase across all platforms. This represents a doubling of Brave’s MAU in &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/2018-highlights/&quot;&gt;one year&lt;/a&gt;. Daily active users tripled in the last 12 months, to 3.3 million. The Brave browser combines privacy with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, and offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/press/1.0-REVIEWERS-GUIDE.pdf&quot;&gt;3-6x faster browsing&lt;/a&gt; than other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Brave 1.0 launch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/brave-rewards/&quot;&gt;Brave Rewards&lt;/a&gt; is now available on Brave for iOS, which contributed to the app’s 27% growth in the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave Verified content creators have also grown significantly, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://batgrowth.com/&quot;&gt;nearly 340,000&lt;/a&gt; creators on platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Web sites, Vimeo, and GitHub. Verified creators have &lt;a href=&quot;https://creators.brave.com/&quot;&gt;signed up&lt;/a&gt; to receive Brave’s built-in token payments from their Brave-using audience. This is a 12x increase from the 28,000 who had verified at the beginning of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the end of the year, with a strong MAU showing for the beginning of December as well, we’ll be sharing more stats from 2019 in the coming weeks and unveiling more exciting features we have in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave is available for download for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, in 52 different languages.

<title>Low-Cost VPS Testing</title>
<link>https://toys.lerdorf.com/low-cost-vps-testing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://toys.lerdorf.com/low-cost-vps-testing</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last time around I was looking for a large dedicated VPS in the $100/month price range. Since then I have started deploying a lot more tiny cloud instances that cost less than $10/month to run just one or two apps. So this time around I am looking for the best bang for the buck for less $10 per month. Unmanaged, of course. Just spin it up with a recent OS and put my public key in the root account. Should be simple enough. Let's see how they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested the following providers. To understand why I rated the way I did, click through to read the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Affiliate/Referral links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included some referral links. I have more than enough hosting available to me, so don't feel obligated to click them. But some of them give you some free credit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very unscientific overall perf test which combines cpu and disk io is to time how long it takes to compile PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;git clone https://git.php.net/repository/php-src.git
cd php-src
./buildconf -f
./configure --disable-all
time make (make -j N for N vCPUs)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disk IO testing for large-file read/write along with random buffered reads is done with dd and hdparm like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;sync; dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/tempfile bs=1M count=8192; sync
# Then wipe the cache (except on OpenVZ virts since you don't really have your own kernel)
/sbin/sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
dd if=/root/tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=8192
/sbin/sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
hdparm -Tt /dev/sdaN&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network perf to California and Netherlands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;  iperf3 -c iperf.he.net
  iperf3 -p 5002 -c speedtest.serverius.net&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/kamatera-services.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/7/e/a/e/3/7eae3012f66c65d9dc7c9a0dad0dc7d86e6fb261-kamatera-services.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kamatera has a PHP service option. For $9/month you get a dedicated cpu thread, 1G of ram and 20G of SSD. That's a nice little setup given the performance should be guaranteed. It is based on Ubuntu 18.04-LTS and comes with PHP 7.3 and nginx-1.14 preconfigured for PHP-FPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can spin up servers in Hong Kong, Toronto, NY, Santa Clara, Texas, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and 5 different cities in Israel. I chose Santa Clara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good PHP 7.3 default config with opcache enabled and mysqlnd plus most common extensions compiled in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nginx/php-fpm works out of the box. You can drop a PHP app into /var/www/html and it will just work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free single-server 30-day trial. Really nice to be able to test out the VPS before committing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;no way to upload a public key to your profile, so you have to do a password-root-login initially&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no IPv6. It's late 2019. Every service should provide IPv6 alongside IPv4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the PHP setup has MySQL/MariaDB support, you have to install your own DB server to use it locally. Of course, there is also a MySQL-specific service, so you could run two servers and separate your web from your DB, but at this pricepoint I don't see too many people doing that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These days any PHP setup is going to need Composer installed. It wasn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nginx setup could use some tuning. (switch to a unix-domain socket for php-fpm, enable sendfile, tune proxy buffers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PHP Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was an nginx/php-fpm service, some nginx/php-fpm specific notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember to turn off display_errors in &lt;code&gt;/etc/php/7.3/fpm/php.ini&lt;/code&gt; before you go live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if this is going to be a dedicated PHP server, I would tweak the following:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;opcache.memory_consumption from 128 to 512 (but leave room for your DB - if you app is DB-heavy, go lower or get a bigger VPS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;opcache.interned_strings_buffer from 8 to 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch nginx to &lt;code&gt;server unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;&lt;/code&gt; and php-fpm to &lt;code&gt;listen = /run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are not going to use a cdn for static files, enable &lt;code&gt;sendfile&lt;/code&gt; in nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Specs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;OS&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also tried the $4/month non-dedicated cpu thread service. Like the previous test, I spun it up in Santa Clara. This time I just selected a regular VPS. It spun up much quicker than the previous service one. 3 minutes vs. 13. Probably because it installed a lot less on it. One slight annoyance was that Debian 10 was not an option. It has been out for a couple of months, so I would expect to see it by now. Performance-wise the $4/month non-dedicated cpu VPS performed about the same as the $9/month dedicated. But, that extra $5 gives you some assurance that you will always see this level of performance. With the cheaper option you have to hope a noisy neighbour doesn't show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Specs&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Kamatera. The signup process and the free trial was smooth. I was able to try different configurations without a bunch of billing hassle and the performance was decent. Initial public key server auth, IPv6, and Debian 10 would be at the top of my wishlist for this service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have $5 single core, 512M ram and 20G SSD. For $10 you get 1G of ram and an extra 10G of SSD storage. Sounds promising. Locations are limited to Michigan, Arizona, Amsterdam and Singapore. I chose the $5 VPS in Arizona. Again, no Debian 10 and the signup process had a bunch of strange upsell options I have never heard of, but whatever, at least they weren't added by default. Also, the &quot;Complete Order&quot; page spun forever on me, but I got an email with an order confirmation so it went through. &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/a2hosting.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/c/d/3/8/6/cd38612800a212b591fd0d39daf81c95e8e7bdf3-a2hosting.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/a2hosting1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/7/d/b/8/e/7db8e84cfcafcff18fe6f5b1f829c58118fc96e0-a2hosting1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No public key initial access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Ipv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Debian 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to go look at the sshd config to see that the default sshd only listens on port 7822&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenVZ virt which means, amongst other things, that you are usually stuck sharing an ancient kernel with other virts on the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not great disk IO performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty nice HTML5 serial console (which I needed to figure out how to ssh in)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of OpenVZ VPS'. The performance tends to be quite good as long as your provider doesn't oversell the host. OpenVZ doesn't isolate you very well from noisy neighbours, so the risk for performance degradation is higher. My test VPS performed well and if it continues to perform at the current level then it is good bang for the buck at $5/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/hostwinds1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/2/5/f/b/f/25fbfb011908977da778ecf793f577aefa693718-hostwinds1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1G Ram with 30G of SSD for $4.49 and 2G/50G for $8.99. Locations in Dallas, Seattle and Amsterdam. I chose the $4.49 ($4.99 recurring) plan in Seattle. Simple and transparent signup process. I really like when providers give me my own IPv6 /64 subnet to play with. In this case the management console didn't let you set the rDNS for arbitrary addresses in that subnet though. I'd have to hit that &quot;Add IPv6 Address&quot; button &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to get to &lt;code&gt;2607:5501:3000:43f:1:5ee:bad:c0de&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But adding it manually on the VM without worrying about the console worked ok. You just don't get reverse dns for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a &quot;Firewall Profile&quot; thing, but I couldn't figure out how to create a new profile. It just had a default profile that allowed all traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to beat $2/month for a capable VPS with supposedly unlimited bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5(!) vCores, 1G of ram and 5G of SSD for €3/month. Each additional 5G of SSD is €0.50. I was not given a choice of where to host it, but the ip shows up as being in Barcelona, so I guess that is the only data center available. The signup process was easy, and while they didn't let me upload my own public key, they created one for me and let me create additional ones and had me download the private key. Then just &lt;code&gt;ssh -i ~/.ssh/clouding.pem root@&amp;lt;ip&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and I was off and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting note was that the marketing folks from Clouding were the only ones to catch on and reach out to me while I was writing this. I suppose it helps being a smaller provider for this, but i thought it was pretty impressive that they connected the dots and figured out I was probably writing a follow-up to my January 2018 VPS Testing article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I tested a 2nd server setup since they were nice enough to contact me. This time a slightly bigger instance for €9/month with 1 core, 4G of ram and 15G of storage. And I went with the &quot;LEMP&quot; template instead of Debian to see what their PHP setup looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a standard Ubuntu nginx 1.14.0 PHP 7.2.19 setup. For an instance with 4G of ram like this, assuming it will be a dedicated web server, you would want to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini&lt;/code&gt; and set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ini&quot;&gt;[opcache]
opcache.enable=1
opcache.memory_consumption=1024
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=256
opcache.max_accelerated_files=100000
opcache.validate_timestamps=1
opcache.revalidate_freq=5
opcache.save_comments=1
opcache.use_cwd=1
opcache.enable_file_override=0
opcache.enable_cli=0
opcache.max_wasted_percentage=10
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=256
opcache.fast_shutdown=1
opcache.huge_code_pages=0
opcache.optimization_level=-1
opcache.log_verbosity_level=2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then run &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart php7.2-fpm&lt;/code&gt; to restart PHP-FPM. If you have a ton of PHP code, keep an eye on &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php phpinfo();?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and look for any restarts. Especially the &lt;code&gt;OOM restarts&lt;/code&gt; counter you will find the in the &lt;code&gt;Opcache&lt;/code&gt; section of &lt;code&gt;phpinfo()&lt;/code&gt;. If that is increasing more than once every couple of days as you push new code, then you need to allocate more memory to Opcache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup had &lt;code&gt;fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;&lt;/code&gt; in the nginx config to have nginx talk to php over a unix domain socket, which is good. And in general the nginx setup had good defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Specs&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow network speed to California is to be expected from a server hosted in Barcelona. Disk reads were a bit below average, but overall this was a pleasant experience. The PHP compile time was near the top of the list which is a good indication that the VPS performance is solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hetzner has been around forever. Locations in Germany (Nuremberg and Falkenstein) and Helskinki. For €2.49/month you get 1 vCPU, 2G RAM and 20G SSD. Or for €4.90 2vCPU/4G/40G. That's quite a bit of power for a service just over $5/month. I really like Hetzner's provisioning process. You get a lot of control over everything. You can even choose between ext4 and XFS for your filesystem. &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/hetzner1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/0/f/9/b/5/0f9b59a5364278b50124075cf94c753fd66cedb8-hetzner1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/hetzner2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/4/a/f/e/9/4afe93eda63ceda31a9472b0f888303b85e8fef9-hetzner2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/hetzner3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/e/7/5/e/6/e75e64d56c1bde07049a8e2963b6e2080300a11f-hetzner3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/user/pages/01.blog/02.Low-Cost-VPS-Testing/hetzner4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://toys.lerdorf.com/images/3/5/6/0/6/35606f52e620d703ffd0eb0e3aeeed82fd6868b0-hetzner4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hetzner is a very polished service to use. New servers spin up almost instantly. It is up to date with the latest OS versions and gives you all sorts of configuration options. IPv6 with your own /64 subnet and reverse DNS and the price vs. performance is awesome. If you need a place to host in Europe, you can't go wrong with Hetzner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt; I really like Upcloud. Through their great referral program from my first article I got a lot of free credits and have been using those to host small projects. If you sign up using my &lt;a href=&quot;https://upcloud.com/signup/?promo=7QZ77S&quot;&gt;referral link&lt;/a&gt; you will get a $25 credit on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$5/month gets you 1 core, 1G of ram and 25G of SSD. For $10 you get double the ram and storage. Locations are Frankfurt, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Chicaco and San Jose. You have plenty of configuration options, including the type of network adapter (VirtIO, Intel E1000 or RealTek RTL8139 emulation) and a choice between standard VGA and Cirrus Logic for your display adapter. The display adapter probably makes a difference if you are doing Windows hosting, which they also support. For my Linux hosting I don't see how it comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impressive to see a single core VPS compile PHP in under 3 minutes! The provisioning process is amazing and now that they have a San Jose location I get 10ms pings from my home connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations Los Angeles (1Gbps), UK (1Gbps), Dallas (10Gbps) and Seattle (10Gbps). Their map shows locations in New Jersey and Amsterdam as well, but I didn't get those as options for my $7 VPS. For those $7/month you get 4 vCPUs, 6G of RAM and 30G of disk! That is almost unbelievable. Let's see what the catch is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting note during their signup process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Anything related to ZenCash, Digital currency mining, Mass mailing, Torrents, TOR, Mining,
IRC, Teamspeak, Starbound, Runescape, Minecraft and Multics are NOT ALLOWED.
Please read our TOS before ordering.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signup process was a bit confusing to me. You didn't really get to configure anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also happened to be the first provider to cleartext email me both the root and management console passwords. I was a little hard on them in my instant cancellation. As it turns out a number of providers I tried after them did the same thing. From a customer support angle I can understand it. It is hard to explain SSH keys. It is much easier to just give out a password. But, I still insist on the public key option, even if a provider wants to default to passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debian 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing performance at this price but beware of load limits and less resource isolation because of OpenVZ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the catch was that it was an OpenVZ VPS. If you can get beyond the rather crappy UI, the terrible password management and the somewhat harsh load limits, this can give you amazing performance for the price. However, as they note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&quot;Users are REQUIRED to control their 15-min system load to remain below 2.0 at all times.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't do this, your VPS can get suspended on you. So really, this isn't actually a VPS. This is more like shared hosting where you are really prone to a noisy neighbour affecting you. They do have a more traditional VPS service called &quot;Premium VPS&quot; at $20/month where you get 1 dedicated vCPU, 4G or RAM and 60G of SSD. That has no load limits, of course. If you are interested, I have an affiliate link you can use: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vpsdime.com/aff.php?aff=1986&quot;&gt;https://vpsdime.com/aff.php?aff=1986&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$3.50 fpr 1 vCPU, 1G of RAM and 15G of SSD. For $7 you can choose between either 2G of RAM or 2 vCPUs along with 20G of storage. Very nice signup process. It is obvious where to add your SSH public key which is always a good sign. Locations are Toronto, Montreal and Roubaix (France). I went with the $7/month 2vCPU option in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No Debian 10 template, but they did have a Debian 10 ISO option so it took a little longer to bring up because I had to do a manual install in a VNC window

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a weird issue that I couldn't get to the iperf port (5201) on iperf.he.net's IPv6 address It worked ok when I switched to IPv4. It didn't appear to be a firewall issue, at least not any firewall I could see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not completely obvious that you have to click your Keypair button to activate it. Since it is solid-filled blue it looks selected, but unless it has an orange border, it isn't.

&lt;p&gt;I like Lunanode. I had some networking confusion, but they were my own doing. If you remove the default security group in the management UI you can't get anywhere. Performance for the 2vCPU $7 VPS was great and if you are looking for a Canadian presence or a non-US North American one, this is a great choice. For a $20 credit you can use my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lunanode.com/?r=12095&quot;&gt;referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$2.50, $3.50 and $5 plans with increasing ram, storage and bandwidth. The $2.50 plan is IPv6-only! There are certainly use-cases where you don't need IPv4. So, of course I had to try that one out. 1 vCPU, 512M of ram and 10G of SSD. Lots of locations all over the world. I chose Atlanta because the $2.50 IPv6-only was only available there and in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly I wasn't able to compile PHP without adding a 1G swap file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.img bs=1M count=1024
    mkswap /swap.img
    chmod 0600 /swap.img
    swapon /swap.img&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that, the performance was pretty good. 3m36 to compile and we know it went into swap doing so. For $2.50/month this was a solid little server. Of course, you would have to keep the IPv6-only aspect in mind for any use-cases. But if you need a server with 18446744073709551616 different possible IP addresses, or perhaps just a server where you can make your IP &lt;code&gt;2001:19f0:5401:2117:1:5ee:bad:c0de&lt;/code&gt;. You can even rdns it easily in the management UI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;    $ host 2001:19f0:5401:2117:1:5ee:bad:c0de
    e.d.0.c.d.a.b.0.e.e.5.0.1.0.0.0.7.1.1.2.1.0.4.5.0.f.9.1.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa domain name pointer iseebadcode.lerdorf.com.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add an IPv4 address to it for $3/month, but they have better $5 deals which include an IPv4. Overall Vultr is a solid service. They get everything right. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7314620&quot;&gt;Referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of locations world-wide. They have a &quot;Nanode&quot; for $5/month with 1 vCPU, 1G of ram and 25G of storage. I chose their Fremont location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$3.35 for 1 vCPU, 2G ram and 20G SSD. Double ram and storage for $6.87. They have data centers all over, but for some reason I was only able to choose the Beauharnois Canada location. And the ordering experience is terrible. You select your VPS and provide billing info and you get a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&quot;Within a maximum of 24 hours, you will receive an email confirming that your VPS has been delivered, along with your bill.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where other providers spin up your VPS within minutes at that point. In the end I got that email about 15 minutes later on a Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disk writes and network performance were quite poor. The emailed root password just grates on my nerves. Having said that, I am actually an OVH US customer because I have one of their dedicated bare metal servers and the provisioning experience wasn't great for that either. I got it at a great price through some introductory offer when they opened a west coast data center and as bad as some of these provisioning and management interfaces are, once you are up and running it doesn't matter that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly the IPv6 I was assigned already had someone else's reverse dns. That is not uncommon for IPv4, but the IPv6 range of addresses is so vast that it is really unusual to see that. And there was an odd thing about needing a number keypad for numbers in the console window. Which wasn't true, of course. When I send it &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; it has no way of knowing if that was typed on number keypad or not.&lt;/p&gt;

They also offer &quot;SSD-boosted&quot; HDD VPS setups if you need lots of storage. Another what's the catch offer. I was a big fan of Contabo last time around, so maybe there is no catch. Let's see. I chose the €4.99 Debian 10 option. It says it is on a 200 Mbit/s switch port, so I suspect that will be reflected in the bandwidth numbers. The €8.99 option is on a 400 Mbit/s switch port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 200G of storage and raw performance at this pricepoint is hard to beat. Disk writes were a little slow, but reads were fast and you are a bit limited by the 200 Mbit switch port on the smaller VPS. Jump to the €8.99 option for more bandwidth. Those emailed passwords though! I understand from a customer support angle that it is easier to just do that, but it wouldn't hurt them to have an &quot;advanced&quot; option somewhere where people who know what they are doing could add their public keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations in Paris and Amsterdam. €2.99/month gets you 2 vCPU with 2G of ram and 20G NVMe storage. Also, cheap ARM instances! For the same €2.99/month you can get a 4 core ARM instance with 2G of ram and 50G of SSD. Or a 6 core/4G instance for €5.99. Of course I had to try the ARM instance. I chose the €2.99 in their Paris data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is an ARM VPS, you can't really compare the performance numbers directly. You get generous storage, 4 cores, decent disk read io and a fast unlimited network connection. It should work well for a small web server that can handle a large number of concurrent requests as long as each one isn't too cpu intensive. And Scaleway gets everything right on the provisioning side, so their regular non-Arm VPS options look like a good choice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Digital Ocean. I probably don't need to include it, but just to compare their current $5/month droplet to the others, I have. You get 1 vCPU (shared), 1G of ram and 25G of SSD. I chose the San Francisco location. They also have NY, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto and Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Ocean has been a solid choice for years. Not necessarily the absolute fastest nor cheapest, but everything just works. The management UI is great. It is a bit annoying that they only provide a non-standard IPv6 /128 subnet. They own the entire 2604:a880:: block and they can fit 4,294,967,296 /64 subnets in that. Over half the people on the planet would need to sign up for a Digital Ocean VPS and enable IPv6 for them to run out. It is a bit nit-picky, of course. I use Digital Ocean myself and a bunch of php.net services are hosted on instances there so I nit-pick on their IPv6 setup because there is nothing else to criticize. For a $50 credit, you can use my &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/a9a3856b1b80&quot;&gt;referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of options below $10 here on both OpenVZ and KVM. They state,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&quot;BuyVM has developed multiple in-house solutions to mitigate &quot;noisy neighbor&quot; issues.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is interesting and I would love to know exactly what they have done. But I am still going to test one of the KVM options instead. They call them KVM Slice servers and they come in $2, $3.50, $7 of the ones under $10. 1 vCPU with 512M/1G/2G of ram and 10G/20G/40G of SSD storage. I went with the middle $3.50 one because 512M is just not enough memory for any of my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have locations in Las Vegas, NY and Luxembourg. I went with Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VM didn't boot initially. I went through the management console and requested a reinstall and it came up after that. Performance was near the top of all the providers tested and the management UI, called Stallion, is ok. It looks like it is all written in PHP, by the way. Interestingly you can change your CPU model between &quot;Intel/AMD&quot; and &quot;Qemu&quot;. You can also toggle APCI, APIC and PAE and choose your network and hard disk drivers. If you are running Windows in your VM this would be handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPV6 part of the management console gave the impression that it could enable it in the VM, but that didn't work for me. I had to do it manually. It probably works on other operating systems. Easy enough, just modify &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/interfaces&lt;/code&gt; and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    iface eth0 inet6 static
        address 2605:6400:0020:016a:1:5ee:bad:c0de
        gateway 2605:6400:0020::1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a /64 with rDNS, so iseebadcode is back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell-session&quot;&gt;    $ host 2605:6400:0020:016a:1:5ee:bad:c0de
    e.d.0.c.d.a.b.0.e.e.5.0.1.0.0.0.a.6.1.0.0.2.0.0.0.0.4.6.5.0.6.2.ip6.arpa domain name pointer iseebadcode.lerdorf.com.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of rDNS, the previous owner's rDNS was left on my IPv4. It was hsiaokang.pigbaby.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad first impression, this turned out to be a solid VM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.frantech.ca/aff.php?aff=3233&quot;&gt;Referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the AWS UI hard to navigate. But once you find your way to the Lightsail section it gets a bit easier. Upload your public key, choose an OS and an instance plan. The $3.50/month was free for a month, so I picked that one. 1 vCPU, 512M of ram and 20G SSD. For $5 you get 1G/40G which is probably the one you should get if you are going to go with Lightsail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of IPv6 from a major provider is baffling to me. Disk IO performance was relatively poor and somehow network from Montreal to Europe was faster than to California. But both were much slower than any other provider tested here. Perhaps they have throttled both disk and network IO on this free mini instance. As tested, this doesn't seem like a very serious offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last time around looking at Azure I got completely lost and frustrated in the UI. Again, after way too many clicks I got to a list of VM options which had 221 entries. At least I could sort it by monthly cost. Only two options below $10. B1ls and B1s for $3.87 and $7.74. 512M vs. 1G of ram, so I chose the larger of the two in the US-West-2 region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't think it was possible to get slower than Amazon Lightsail's disk IO, but Azure managed to somehow. CPU and network performance was good though. And I liked that I was able to specify my own initial account to create. But for the price, there are better offerings out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signup was smooth. I liked that it was possible to turn off password logins entirely before the VPS was even created and the process to add an ssh key was trivial. Locations are Los Angeles and NY. The LA data center has more bandwidth and it is closer to me, so I chose that for a $5/month VPS which gave me 1 vCPU, 2G of ram and 30G of SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer hardware virtualization for the better resource isolation. That said, this was a good LXC implementation with public key setup, password logins disabled and IPv6 with a /124 (16 IPs) and it got under the 3-minute mark for the PHP compile. This is not a bad choice if you are ok with a container instead of a hardware virt. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skysilk.com/ref/CDdqohO0Om&quot;&gt;Referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locations in Silicon Valley, Toronto, Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, NY, Singapore, Sydney, Hong Kong, Miami, Dallas and Chicago. For $4.99 you get 1 vCPU, 1G of ramand 25G of SSD. $9.99 doubles that, including the CPUs which is a pretty good deal. Since $9.99 just sneaks in under my &amp;lt; $10 rule for this test, I chose that one in the Silicon Valley location. Smooth signup process. I hadn't added my SSH key before I created the VPS, but that was my mistake. I do prefer when that is part of the flow so you don't have to go looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PHP compile time&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not that enthusiastic about admin consoles that log into my VPS and make changes to my network config and potentially other things. Once deployed, nobody and nothing should have access to my server except me. To allocate me another IP, just give me the IP info and if you want to hold my hand give me a short snippet to add to my &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/interfaces&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have preferred a /64 IPv6 subnet. They own the full 2604:bc0:: block, so they literally have over 4 billion /64 subnets available to them. Interestingly I noticed that 2604:bc0:1:: is assigned to their Chicago data center, 2604:bc0:2:: to NY, :3 to Silicon Valley, and :4 to Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, this was a nice setup. Compile time under 3 minutes, which you would expect from a dual-core VM, and both disk and network IO were fast. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vpsserver.com/?affcode=ee6c3a3a3688&quot;&gt;Referral link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $4/month you get 1 vCPU, 1G of RAM and 15G of storage. But they also have some really cheap 6 and 12-month deals. Interestingly they have an option for an Asia-Pacific optimized network out of their Los Angeles data center location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provisioning was lightning quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly unlimited fast network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No public key initial login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailed me my VPS root password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management console a bit slow and awkward to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Debian 10&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really slow PHP compile time. Disk IO wasn't super-fast either, but not slow enough to be causing such a slow PHP compile time. There just wasn't enough CPU available. Network speeds were good with a really high transfer limit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dented Reality: Magic Leap Sees Slow Sales, Steep Losses</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;As Magic Leap neared the release of its first augmented reality headset in August 2018, the company’s founder and CEO Rony Abovitz had a bullish target, telling investors and colleagues in meetings that he wanted to sell at least one million units within the product’s first year, according to four people who repeatedly heard the goal from Abovitz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Magic Leap executives convinced Abovitz—an entrepreneur known for his bold predictions about how the company’s products will disrupt computing—to settle on a more modest plan of selling at least 100,000 headsets in the first year, eventually scaling up to millions of units with future iterations, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;takeaway-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;The Takeaway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Magic Leap aimed to sell at least 100,000 headsets in first year&lt;br/&gt;• After the first six months on the market, it instead sold around 6,000 units&lt;br/&gt;• Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai left board last year&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even that goal, which was shared with Magic Leap’s board, proved too ambitious. About six months after the device’s launch, Magic Leap had sold roughly 6,000 of the headsets, said a person with direct knowledge of the figures. The company’s internal sales figures and goals haven’t been previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow sales aren't the only signs of strain at Magic Leap, which was losing tens of millions of dollars per month throughout last year, said two people with knowledge of its finances. Dozens of employees across various departments have been laid off in recent weeks. A marquee member of its board—Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, a large Magic Leap investor—quietly stepped down from that position last year in a previously unreported departure (another Google executive replaced him). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two top Magic Leap executives, CFO Scott Henry and SVP of creative strategy John Gaeta, left those posts last month. Their departures were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/magic-leap-cfo-scott-henry-steps-down-john-gaeta-out-2019-11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported by Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few startups have generated as much hype in recent years as Magic Leap, part of a wave of companies working on augmented reality devices that overlay digital imagery on people’s views of the real world. The company, last valued in 2018 at roughly $6.4 billion, has described its technology in ambitious terms, calling it “spatial computing” and suggesting that it will one day replace mobile phones. Prototypes of the technology helped Magic Leap attract a star-studded list of investors, including Google, Alibaba, the government of Saudi Arabia and Andreessen Horowitz, raising about $2.6 billion to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its first product—the Magic Leap One, which retails for $2,300—underwhelmed many reviewers when it came out last year, with Oculus VR co-founder Palmer Luckey &lt;a href=&quot;https://palmerluckey.com/magic-leap-is-a-tragic-heap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;calling the device a “tragic heap&lt;/a&gt;.” In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-magic-leap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Information reported&lt;/a&gt; that some of the prototype technologies that had so dazzled Magic Leap’s early investors were too large to be incorporated into its final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much larger tech companies, including Apple and Facebook, are placing similar bets on AR as the next big tech phenomenon after mobile, which will intensify competition for Magic Leap in the future. Both tech giants are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;working on their own devices&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft already offers an AR headset, HoloLens. Technology research firm IDC estimates that there will be about 500,000 AR headsets shipped worldwide this year, compared to about 7 million VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Leap has raised more money than any other AR hardware startup of the past 10 years, according to the financial research firm PitchBook. Meanwhile, global venture investments in AR startups hit a high of $3.62 billion last year and were at $2.42 billion for 2019 as of December 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is currently seeking fresh funding through a series E round that will be a mix of convertible debt and equity, a spokesperson recently told The Information. In August, the company assigned its portfolio of nearly 2,000 patents as collateral to JPMorgan Chase, a participant in an earlier investment round, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://legacy-assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/assignment-pat-050138-0287.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It couldn’t be learned if JPMorgan was acting as a lender for the company’s Series E round (a spokesperson for the bank declined to comment). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising under such terms is standard for a bank or private lender, said Alex Urdea, whose firm Upper90 specializes in debt financing for tech companies. But it indicates the lender sees “capped upside returns” and wants “downside protection,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has raised a large amount of funding in the past, Magic Leap is an expensive operation. Throughout 2018, the company burned around $40 million to $50 million per month, according to two people with knowledge of its finances. It currently has roughly 1,700 employees in offices scattered around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen former Magic Leap employees and other people close to the company. All of them requested anonymity because of company restrictions on discussing confidential information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Magic Leap declined requests to discuss specific details in this story, but provided a broad statement disputing it. “The Information’s reporting is littered with inaccuracies and misleading statements, and erroneously portrays Magic Leap’s operations, internal plans and overall strategy,” the statement read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this story was published, The Information learned of an internal Magic Leap all-hands meeting earlier this week. In the meeting, Magic Leap’s chief marketing officer, Daniel Diez, described the story The Information was then working on as “clickbait&quot; and a “bunch of bullshit.” He described this reporter as an “asshole” and said others in the media were looking to expose the next Theranos or WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then told employees to “stay the course” and “protect the company” by keeping confidential information “under lock and key.” He didn’t address specifics details in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Buzz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Leap was founded in 2010 by Rony Abovitz, an eccentric, 47-year-old Florida native who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8J5BWL8oJY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;once gave a TED talk&lt;/a&gt; in a spacesuit surrounded by people dancing to music in furry monster costumes. The previous company Abovitz helped create, Mako Surgical, made robotic arms for surgeons and was sold in 2013 for roughly $1.6 billion. He based Magic Leap in Plantation, Florida, far away from Silicon Valley, New York and other traditional tech hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abovitz has told employees he wants the company to hire people who are akin to Navy SEALs—the elite special operations force. He still personally signs off on new hires, who are told that it’s harder to get a job at Magic Leap than it is to be accepted into Harvard. Abovitz also has a tendency to hyperbolize, at different times telling employees in company meetings he thinks Magic Leap will have a $100 billion valuation one day while also predicting that it will hold the world's first trillion-dollar initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abovitz proved skilful at building anticipation for Magic Leap’s product—even if it required stretching the boundaries of what the final technology would be able to do. The company publicly released teaser videos to drum up excitement, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPMHcanq0xM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one from 2015&lt;/a&gt; that showed a game with an employee blasting robots that pop out of the ceiling inside his office. The video was made by a special effects company, rather than an actual demonstration of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential investors, including leaders of top tech companies and venture firms, made pilgrimages to Florida for demonstrations of the company’s AR technology, an early version of which was a  refrigerator-sized prototype called the “Beast” by company employees. Many were dazzled by what they saw, and wrote checks to be a part of the revolutionary new computing medium they believed Magic Leap was building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Magic Leap secured an eye-popping $514 million investment led by Google. Sundar Pichai, the now-CEO of Google parent Alphabet, joined as a board director, while Don Harrison, Google’s longtime head of mergers and acquisitions, became a board observer. Magic Leap later lured other big name investors such as Alibaba and Qualcomm. AT&amp;amp;T and Japan’s NTT Docomo also bought stakes in the company, which has said that faster 5G wireless data speeds will be essential to deliver a software platform aimed at developers that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magicleap.com/news/op-ed/magicverse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it calls the Magicverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Magic Leap lost two tech luminaries connected with its board through corporate investments. Sundar Pichai and Paul Jacobs, the former executive chairman of Qualcomm, quietly stepped off as a director and observer, respectively. Neither departure has been previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pichai left the board due to the demands of his schedule, according to a person familiar with the matter. He was replaced by Jennifer Fitzpatrick, a Google senior vice president who leads Google Maps. Qualcomm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-qualcomm-chairman-ceo-paul-jacobs-may-step-down-from-board-1521213846&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pushed Jacobs off its board&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 after Jacobs disclosed an effort to organize a buyout of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Launch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that it could produce enough of its headsets to avoid back orders and to satisfy Abovitz’s demands for secrecy, Magic Leap made big bets on its supply chain. It built its own factory capable of pumping out a million displays for its headset a year at its sprawling Florida headquarters, an unusual move for an electronics startup, according to three people involved in the effort. It also set up another facility in Mexico with an outside partner dedicated to assembling the devices, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before the headset went on sale in August 2018, Abovitz told employees in a memo that he wanted to have 100,000 “insanely happy customers,” according to five people who received the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Leap employees set up a war room at the company’s Florida headquarters for the August 2018 sales rollout of its first headset. Screens around the room displayed sales figures for the device, but the numbers represented the quantity Magic Leap hoped to sell, which was higher than actual sales, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Employees were later told the company didn't have time before the launch to put a real-time sales reporting system together that could show actual numbers in the war room, said one of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the company, Magic Leap executives have been cagey with rank-and-file employees about how well its product is selling. They haven’t disclosed the figures in company-wide meetings—which are known internally as The Loop—even though questions about the topic are frequently submitted and upvoted by employees in an internal system it uses to compile anonymous questions ahead of the meetings, said two people with knowledge of the meetings. When asked how Magic Leap plans to build a sustainable business in those meetings, Abovitz has said multiple times that the company is still “learning to swim,” said two people who heard the remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs of belt-tightening at the company. Magic Leap recently laid off dozens of people across different departments, including its recruiting and engineering teams, and earlier this year the pace of hiring in parts of the company slowed, said multiple people with knowledge of the matter. Work travel for some Magic Leap groups was temporarily frozen earlier this year, said one of those people. Employees started receiving free headsets earlier this year, with some managers telling staffers it was because the company couldn’t sell enough and had extra inventory, said multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Magic Leap hosted an inaugural developer conference in October of last year to rally app makers around its product, it didn’t hold a follow-up conference this year. It also hasn’t yet reopened an annual developer grant program—another method to spur the creation of apps, which it first offered last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Leap also bid on a roughly $500 million contract last year to provide AR headsets to the military, which was ultimately awarded to Microsoft (Magic Leap’s bidding on the contract was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-21/magic-leap-is-bidding-on-an-army-combat-contract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reported by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;). It also sought a lucrative deal to participate in the Dubai 2020 Expo to demonstrate a city of the future concept with Magic Leap technology, said four people with knowledge of the effort, which hasn’t been previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates from Magic Leap flew to Dubai multiple times in 2018 to try to secure the deal, one of the people with direct knowledge said. It couldn’t be learned what the current status of the Dubai effort is. In March, the company also expanded sales of its headset beyond its web site through a partnership with AT&amp;amp;T, which sells the product through some of its wireless stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Leap is currently prototyping the second major version of its headset, codenamed ML2, that features 5G compatibility, higher quality graphics, a wider field of view, greater depth perception and a smaller and lighter headset that comes in multiple colors. Earlier this year, a person involved with the project told employees the device is still years away from launch due to fundamental technology constraints, said a former Magic Leap employee who heard the remarks and saw a prototype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also worked on a shorter-term update to its first headset with slight hardware improvements that could be released sooner, said two people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2018 all-hands meeting, Abovitz told employees that Magic Leap has received acquisition offers that he has declined, according to a person who heard the remark. But in 2016, the company showed enough interest in a potential deal to tap the investment bank Allen &amp;amp; Company to arrange talks with Apple, Google, and Facebook, said three people with knowledge of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the three companies, including their respective CEOs, flew to Magic Leap’s headquarters to meet separately with Abovitz and his senior executive team, according to the three people. The discussions didn’t progress to formal acquisition offers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Privacy analysis of Tiktok’s app and website</title>
<link>https://rufposten.de/blog/2019/12/05/privacy-analysis-of-tiktoks-app-and-website/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rufposten.de/blog/2019/12/05/privacy-analysis-of-tiktoks-app-and-website/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I did a detailed privacy check of the Tiktok app and website. Tiktok commits multiple breaches of law, trust, transparency and data protection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are all technical and legal details. You can read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/tiktok-ueberwachung-daten-kritik-1.4709779&quot;&gt;less technical article about it at the Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/a&gt; (german).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my setup: I used mitmproxy to route all app traffic for analysis. See in this video how device information, usage time and watched videos are sent to Appsflyer and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe that this is covered by „legitimate interest“ and transparency: Entered search terms are sent to Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau-1024x481.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1093&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau-1024x481.png 1024w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau-300x141.png 300w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau-768x361.png 768w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau-1536x721.png 1536w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/facebook_search_tagesschau.png 1597w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transfers to both companies break different rules of the GDPR: Facebook can’t fulfill Art. 14 (information, deletion etc.) on this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to Appsflyer lacks transparency as it’s unknown to which of the 4500+ Appsflyer partners the data will be transferred afterwards. Bytedance: „We don’t show the contracts.“ Did they even read Art. 26 GDPR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important: Fundamental rights are violated because Personal Identifying Information (PII) is transfered to a server that is under control of a company in an unsecure noneuropean country. The server location doesn’t count, it is about where the company deciding about the data resides, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.malteengeler.de/&quot;&gt;Malte Engeler&lt;/a&gt;. Bytedance Headquarter: Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also checked the website which is important as all shared videos (via messenger or social media) are viewed there. The short URL e.g. &lt;em&gt;vm.tiktok.com/9uTpDV&lt;/em&gt; will be resolved to a URL which contains the installation ID. Tiktok will be able to check who shared which video.&lt;/p&gt;

Among common trackers (Google Analytics) they use the highly controversial method of device fingerprinting to set a mostly unique hash to the cookie s_v_webid. This is done by combining typical hardware and browser characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-1024x515.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1096&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-1024x515.png 1024w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-300x151.png 300w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-768x387.png 768w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-1536x773.png 1536w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tiktok_cookie-2048x1031.png 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_pcslides.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1097&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; height=&quot;97&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_pcslides.png 819w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_pcslides-300x144.png 300w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_pcslides-768x369.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them: Canvas Fingerprinting. They draw an image in the background using vector graphic commands. Afterwards they save the image to a rasterized PNG. This data is quite unique among different devices depending on settings and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also use audio fingerprinting to identify visitors. This doesn’t mean they actually use your microphone or speaker. Instead they generate a sound internally and record the bitstream, which also differs from device to device. This is what it sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_akam.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1099&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; srcset=&quot;https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_akam.png 677w, https://rufposten.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/canvas_akam-300x170.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bytedance told me that they use this fingerprinting to identify malicous browser behaviour. I don’t believe, because the website still works if the script is blocked. Also they use Akamai’s fingerprinting technology already on the server (which is another story to investigate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other breaches e.g. Google Analytics is used without anonymizing the IP data. And they use free software without proper license, for example Zepto.js from Thomas Fuchs, Murmur Hash from Austin Appleby and FingerprintJS from Valentin Vasilyev. How low can you go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the PRIVACY problems with Tiktok. Last week Netzpolitik published detailed information about CENSORSHIP problems. Read this 3 articles starting here &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org/2019/discrimination-tiktok-curbed-reach-for-people-with-disabilities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://netzpolitik.org/2019/discrimination-tiktok-curbed-reach-for-people-with-disabilities/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So is it a good idea by Tagesschau to foster this system with videos paid by german households?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel operators may fall under joint controllership with Tiktok as the ECJ ruled for FB fanpages. A channel could be closed if Tiktok violates privacy. DPO of german public broadcaster NDR, Heiko Neuhoff told me, he will soon decide if this applies to the channel of Tagesschau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My comment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiktok is breaking the law in multiple ways while exploiting mainly teenagers data. This should be regulated quick and rigorous. We have all necessary laws. Don’t let them break society like 10 years of FB. Journalists should find a better place for vertical video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I published this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MatthiasEberl/status/1202292531829981184&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://social.tchncs.de/web/statuses/103250929105942821&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; first and later transfered it with minor corrections to this blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
