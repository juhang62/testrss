&lt;p&gt;In addition to 5.6 million square feet of directly vacant, un-leased office space spread across the city, which is up from around 3.7 million square feet of un-leased space &lt;a href=&quot;http://socketsite.com/archives/2019/10/record-office-rents-in-san-francisco-tick-up-absorption-slows.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;at the same time last year&lt;/a&gt;, there is now 6.2 million square feet of office space in San Francisco which has been leased but is sitting vacant and actively seeking a subletter, which is up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://socketsite.com/archives/2019/10/record-office-rents-in-san-francisco-tick-up-absorption-slows.html&quot;&gt;770,000 square feet of sublettable space at the same time last year&lt;/a&gt;, according to Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, there is now 11.8 million square feet of vacant office space spread across San Francisco for a citywide vacancy rate of 14.1 percent, which is up from an office vacancy rate of 9.8 percent at the end of the second quarter and versus a vacancy rate of 5.5 percent, representing 4.5 million square feet of vacant space, at the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, leasing activity over the past two quarters hit at a 30-year low, with only 385,000 square feet of leasing activity in the third quarter, versus a post DotCom-era nadir of 933,000 square feet in the second quarter of 2001, and with roughly 3.1 million square feet of office space now under construction as well (half of which is currently pre-leased, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://socketsite.com/archives/2016/09/uber-about-to-start-building-new-san-francisco-hq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Uber’s new buildings on Third&lt;/a&gt;, and 1.6 million square feet which is not, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://socketsite.com/archives/2016/11/san-franciscos-second-tallest-tower-slated-for-occupancy-in-2021.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the million square foot Oceanwide tower rising at 50 First&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while landlords held firm through the second quarter of the year, asking rents for office space in the city dropped nearly 6 percent in the third quarter alone to $78.45 per square foot (per year), which is only down 0.8 percent on a year-over-year basis but poised to drop rather dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I am seriously considering going back to desktop computers</title>

<description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/pics/storm-trooper-anxiety-400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Computer Anxiety&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

10-25-20&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of personal computing looks rather bleak to me. The golden age of personal computing in the 1980's is long over. During the past ten years or so, I have been hearing about and seeing the effects of new approaches that governments and computer hardware and software vendors have been inventing to limit the power and utility of our computers. As far as I can see, the end is our subjugation within their ecosystems and our dependence on their cloud solutions. Whether their tools are UEFI, the elimination of useful software (as in the DMCA take-down of the Youtube Downloader website last week), the creation of new operating systems that move computing power out of our computers and into the cloud, &quot;secure&quot; hardware that we cannot modify, or some other approach does not matter. The point is that they are making it harder and harder for us to do what we want with our computers. They are successfully taking away our general-purpose computers and replacing them with little more than Internet appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an Internet appliance has its place, so does a general-purpose computer. General-purpose computers allow us to own our music and videos--not just watch them until Netflix's contract for our favorite Star Wars movie expires or Apple decides to somehow prevent us from accessing our favorite song in its inventory. A general-purpose computer also allows us to own applications that governments, computer hardware and software companies, and the music and movie industries would rather we did not have--software like Kodi, Handbrake, VLC player, Youtube Downloader, DVD rippers, and open source decentralized applications, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what I do not like about the new computer hardware has been thrust upon us in the name of thinness. I can only surmise that laptop manufacturers' fixation with thinness is about profitability, because it certainly is not about usability. Thin laptops are thermally throttled due to insufficient airflow. They are also less repairable and upgradeable. Some are not upgradeable at all. In fact, it seems that a higher percentage of laptops are completely nonupgradeable every year. User-replaceable batteries are long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laptop manufacturers have also justified decreased usability in the name of security. I should call their solutions &quot;security theater&quot;, because they seem to benefit Microsoft more than computer users. Many have said that UEFI is an overly-complicated system that provides a much larger attack surface than BIOS, and several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eweek.com/security/researcher-reveals-bios-firmware-implementation-flaws-at-black-hat&quot;&gt;security flaws&lt;/a&gt; in UEFI implementations have been found that seem to negate many of the supposed benefits. While I understand that firmware malware is a legitimate cause for concern, UEFI seems to me to have been more about locking Linux out of the laptop market to insure that Microsoft Windows remained dominant. Now that Microsoft has lost that battle, can we go back to having the option of installing whatever operating systems we want? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that all hope is not lost. People find ways around oppressive practices. I also know that solutions can sometimes take decades to appear. Whole generations can be lost in the mean time. This is why the trend toward stripped-down, Big-Brother-controlled computers has me genuinely worried. I am not looking forward to a near-term future in which my operating system is so locked down that I cannot install the software I want. Many have already reached this future, perhaps without even having realized it. But, so far, I have successfully avoided it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my use of Linux will forestall the future to which others have already succumbed, but I cannot continue buying old laptops forever. I have been using laptops manufactured before 2012 partly to avoid UEFI and secure boot. I know that new &quot;open&quot; laptops are still available, but most of them--the System76's, the Purisms, etc.--are overpriced in my opinion. I also know that HP and Dell continue to be more Linux friendly. How long with that last? For years, I have put up with the drawbacks of laptops in exchange for their use wherever I wanted. Now, nine or more years out of date in computer technology, I am still using laptops with mostly USB 2.0 ports and internal SATA SSD's. That means dealing with very slow backups. I seem to be forever making backups. Eventually, laptops manufactured before 2012 will be too slow to do the things I need to do. When that time comes, I will have to transition to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking &quot;something else&quot; may be a desktop computer that I build myself. Although I have not owned a desktop computer in seven years, I am seriously considering building one for the reasons outlined above. I also want a computer that I can tinker with again. I am &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; that building a desktop computer with my choice of motherboards will allow me to avoid Trusted Platform Module chips and UEFI in which secure boot cannot be disabled. The key word is &quot;hoping&quot;, because I have not yet researched enough to determine if one can still find motherboards upon which to base computers that are more fully under the user's control. Overwriting UEFI with Coreboot may also be a solution, but it seems rather drastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What worries me as much as the end of general-purpose computing for the masses is that so few seem to understand that it is ending. Many are content to use &quot;devices&quot; that are merely stripped-down Internet appliances masquerading as reasonable substitutes for what they have replaced. Has the word &quot;device&quot; been substituted for the word &quot;computer&quot; in an effort to erase even the memory of what we are losing? Many do not understand, because they are too young to ever have used a true general-purpose computer. They have no experience with anything but locked-down platforms--just as 96% of the generation before them knew nothing but Microsoft operating systems. To call this a tragedy is not being overly dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;--Tie&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple, Google and a Deal That Controls the Internet</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/technology/apple-google-search-antitrust.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/technology/apple-google-search-antitrust.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;OAKLAND, Calif. — When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google’s search engine as the preselected choice on Apple’s iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry’s pecking order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Department &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;filed a landmark lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google — the U.S. government’s biggest antitrust case in two decades — and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company’s illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The scrutiny of the pact, which was first inked 15 years ago and has rarely been discussed by either company, has highlighted the special relationship between Silicon Valley’s two most valuable companies — an unlikely union of rivals that regulators say is unfairly preventing smaller companies from flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have this sort of strange term in Silicon Valley: co-opetition,” said Bruce Sewell, Apple’s general counsel from 2009 to 2017. “You have brutal competition, but at the same time, you have necessary cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apple and Google are joined at the hip even though Mr. Cook has said internet advertising, Google’s bread and butter, engages in “surveillance” of consumers and even though Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, once promised “thermonuclear war” on his Silicon Valley neighbor when he learned it was working on a rival to the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apple and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, worth more than $3 trillion combined, do compete on plenty of fronts, like smartphones, digital maps and laptops. But they also know how to make nice when it suits their interests. And few deals have been nicer to both sides of the table than the iPhone search deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nearly half of Google’s search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/20/us/doj-google-suit.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;, and the prospect of losing the Apple deal has been described as a “code red” scenario inside the company. When iPhone users search on Google, they see the search ads that drive Google’s business. They can also find their way to other Google products, like YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A former Google executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to talk about the deal, said the prospect of losing Apple’s traffic was “terrifying” to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Justice Department, which is asking for a court injunction preventing Google from entering into deals like the one it made with Apple, argues that the arrangement has unfairly helped make Google, which handles &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;92 percent of the world’s internet searches&lt;/a&gt;, the center of consumers’ online lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Online businesses like Yelp and Expedia, as well as companies ranging from &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/technology/big-tech-antitrust-scrutiny.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;noodle shops to news organizations&lt;/a&gt;, often complain that Google’s search domination enables it to charge advertising fees when people simply look up their names, as well as to steer consumers toward its own products, like Google Maps. Microsoft, which had its own antitrust battle two decades ago, has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told British regulators&lt;/a&gt; that if it were the default option on iPhones and iPads, it would make more advertising money for every search on its rival search engine, Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What’s more, competitors like DuckDuckGo, a small search engine that sells itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google, could never match Google’s tab with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments — up from &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-22/google-paid-apple-1-billion-to-keep-search-bar-on-iphone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$1 billion a year&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 — in exchange for building Google’s search engine into its products. It is probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple’s annual profits. That’s not money Apple would be eager to walk away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In fact, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai met again in 2018 to discuss how they could increase revenue from search. After the meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart that “our vision is that we work as if we are one company,” according to the Justice Department’s complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A forced breakup could mean the loss of easy money to Apple. But it would be a more significant threat to Google, which would have no obvious way to replace the lost traffic. It could also push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine. Within Google, people believe that Apple is one of the few companies in the world that could offer a formidable alternative, according to one former executive. Google has also worried that without the agreement, Apple could make it more difficult for iPhone users to get to the Google search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the partnership, while a Google spokesman pointed to a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which the company defended the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even though its bill with Apple keeps going up, Google has said again and again that it dominates internet search because consumers prefer it, not because it is buying customers. The company argues that the Justice Department is painting an incomplete picture; its partnership with Apple, it says, is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other search engines like Microsoft’s Bing also have revenue-sharing agreements with Apple to appear as secondary search options on iPhones, Google says in its defense. It adds that Apple allows people to change their default search engine from Google — though few probably do because people typically don’t tinker with such settings and many prefer Google anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apple has rarely, if ever, publicly acknowledged its deal with Google, and according to Bernstein Research, has mentioned its so-called licensing revenue in an earnings call for the first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;According to a former senior executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality contracts, Apple’s leaders have made the same calculation about Google as much of the general public: The utility of its search engine is worth the cost of its invasive practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Their search engine is the best,” Mr. Cook said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tim-cook-interview-apple-google-axios-on-hbo-dab905ce-26b4-4450-b177-11ad46d1e13a.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when asked by Axios&lt;/a&gt; in late 2018 why he partnered with a company he also implicitly criticized. He added that Apple had also created ways to blunt Google’s collection of data, such as a private-browsing mode on Apple’s internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The deal is not limited to searches in Apple’s Safari browser; it extends to virtually all searches done on Apple devices, including with Apple’s virtual assistant, Siri, and on Google’s iPhone app and Chrome browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The relationship between the companies has swung from friendly to contentious to today’s “co-opetition.” In the early years of Google, the company’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw Mr. Jobs as a mentor, and they would take long walks with him to discuss the future of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2005, Apple and Google inked what at the time seemed like a modest deal: Google would be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser on Mac computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Quickly, Mr. Cook, then still a deputy to Mr. Jobs, saw the arrangement’s lucrative potential, according to another former senior Apple executive who asked not to be named. Google’s payments were pure profit, and all Apple had to do was feature a search engine its users already wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apple expanded the deal for its big upcoming product: the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/technology/10apple.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;unveiled the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, he invited Eric Schmidt, Google’s then chief executive, to join him onstage for the first of Apple’s many famous iPhone events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If we just sort of merged the two companies, we could just call them AppleGoo,” joked Mr. Schmidt, who was also on Apple’s board of directors. With Google search on the iPhone, he added, “you can actually merge without merging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then the relationship soured. Google had quietly been developing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/technology/05cnd-gphone.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a competitor to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;: smartphone software called Android that any phone maker could use. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/technology/14brawl.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mr. Jobs was furious&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, Apple &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/technology/03patent.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;sued a phone maker&lt;/a&gt; that used Android. “I’m going to destroy Android,” Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. “I will spend my last dying breath if I need to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A year later, Apple introduced Siri. Instead of Google underpinning the virtual assistant, it was Microsoft’s Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet the companies’ partnership on iPhones continued — too lucrative for either side to blow it up. Apple had arranged the deal to require periodic renegotiations, according to a former senior executive, and each time, it extracted more money from Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You have to be able to maintain those relationships and not burn a bridge,” said Mr. Sewell, Apple’s former general counsel, who declined to discuss specifics of the deal. “At the same time, when you’re negotiating on behalf of your company and you’re trying to get the best deal, then, you know, the gloves come off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Around 2017, the deal was up for renewal. Google was facing a squeeze, with clicks on its mobile ads not growing fast enough. Apple was not satisfied with Bing’s performance for Siri. And Mr. Cook had just announced that Apple aimed to double its services revenue to $50 billion by 2020, an ambitious goal that would be possible only with Google’s payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-158dogj evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the fall of 2017, Apple announced that Google was now helping Siri answer questions, and Google disclosed that its payments for search traffic had jumped. The company offered an anodyne explanation to part of the reason it was suddenly paying some unnamed company hundreds of millions of dollars more: “changes in partner agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<title>Philipp Hagemeister, former YouTube-dl maintainer re: takedown</title>
<link>https://news.perthchat.org/youtube-dl-removed-from-github/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.perthchat.org/youtube-dl-removed-from-github/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friday night on the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of October the ‘Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA)’ sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md&quot;&gt;DMCA request&lt;/a&gt; to GitHub asking that the popular YouTube downloading software ‘youtube-dl’ be taken down. GitHub responded as by immediately removing the repositories and 17 forked pieces of software from it’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png 1405w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most DMCA notices are regarding the unauthorised distribution of a particular piece of media, and they request that a media be taken down. This DMCA notice was different since it’s targeting tools that can be used to reproduce copyrighted media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youtube-DL is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense&quot;&gt;Unlicense&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-copyright license that promises ownership of the software to the public domain. As such it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute the software itself. There are many other places you can find copies of this software besides the current maintainers GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice claimed the youtube-dl software was a ‘Anticircumvention Violation’ as well as a violation of YouTube’s terms of service. It requested that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask that you immediately take down and disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the representative list set forth above.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also draws attention to the examples featured in the youtube-dl source code which include examples of how to download copyrighted music from Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift. The notice also claimed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorised streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the youtube-dl software cannot be used to distribute music, only to reproduce it. It’s also possible to use youtube-dl to reproduce public domain or creative commons work that people do have the right to copy and redistribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now the software remains widely distributed and used. It can still be accessed through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yt-dl.org/download.html&quot;&gt;existing yt-dl.org website.&lt;/a&gt; Last year the RIAA was &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-delists-youtube-rippers-from-google-using-rare-anti-circumvention-notices-191108/&quot;&gt;able to get 5 YouTube ‘ripper’ sites removed from the Google search engine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener-1.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1366w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;perthchat-news-interview-with-philipp-hagemeister&quot;&gt;Perthchat News Interview With Philipp Hagemeister&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I reached out to previous maintainer Phillip Hagemeister, who had this to say about the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you worried you will see any personal damages from this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a seize and desist letter from German lawyers a couple of weeks ago. However, there are a number of technical inaccuracies in that letter; in particular the lawyers did not seem to have understood that my maintainership of youtube-dl ended years ago. Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any other comments about the incident?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving. That's not to say I think that DRM subversion should be illegal in the first place, but that's a political rather than a legal issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is in no way to blame. They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support. I hope they can work with future maintainer of youtube-dl to get the project back on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thanks go to everybody who has contributed so far to youtube-dl, but especially to the current maintainer Sergey. I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp;amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Zoom Deleted Events Discussing Zoom “Censorship”</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/zoom-deleted-events-censorship</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/zoom-deleted-events-censorship</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Zoom shut down a series of events meant to discuss what organizers called “censorship” by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events were planned for Oct. 23, and were organized in response to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453935/zoom-facebook-youtube-cancel-talk-leila-khaled-san-francisco-state-university&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous cancellation by Zoom&lt;/a&gt; of a San Francisco State University talk by Leila Khalid, a member of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terror organization in the US. Khalid is best known for highjacking two planes, one in 1969 and one in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453935/zoom-facebook-youtube-cancel-talk-leila-khaled-san-francisco-state-university&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told the Verge&lt;/a&gt; at the time that the Sept. 23 talk was in violation of the company’s terms of service. The Verge also reported that the action was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelawfareproject.org/releases/2020/9/22/victory-lawfare-project-and-endjewhatred-movement-cause-zoom-to-cancel-leila-khaled-webinar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in response to pressure&lt;/a&gt; by Jewish and Israel lobby groups, such as The Lawfare project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Sept. 23 cancellation, a group of academics &lt;a href=&quot;https://samidoun.net/event/campuses-across-north-america-online-we-will-not-be-silenced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organized a series of events&lt;/a&gt; across the country, as well as in Canada and the UK, which were meant to highlight the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Campuses across North America are joining in the campaign to resist corporate and university silencing of Palestinian narratives and Palestinian voices,” said the day of action &lt;a href=&quot;https://samidoun.net/event/campuses-across-north-america-online-we-will-not-be-silenced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;event description&lt;/a&gt;, which was meant to be held on Oct. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The follow-up events did not include Khalid presenting. The event held in part by New York University, which was canceled the day of, included a compilation of her previous statements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rimanajjar.medium.com/leila-khaled-on-campus-letters-from-zoom-palestine-legal-aaup-fec660c6d57b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to a blog post on the incident&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Khaled is undergoing medical treatment and was unable to provide a voice message for the occasion,” the post stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zoom is committed to supporting the open exchange of ideas and conversations and does not have any policy preventing users from criticizing Zoom,” a spokesperson for the company said. “Zoom does not monitor events and will only take action if we receive reports about possible violations of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/terms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/acceptable-use-policy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/community-standards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Standards&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the event held by San Francisco State University, we determined that this event was in violation of one or more of these policies and let the host know that they were not permitted to use Zoom for this particular event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Zoom did not respond to questions about which specific policy was violated or whether other events have been shut down by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Saeed, a student at University of Leeds, said he used his personal Zoom account to organize the event. He told BuzzFeed News that the company deleted his event and disabled his account without explanation. He contacted the company’s customer support line, but said he has not yet heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It cannot be a unilateral decision saying, ‘You violated our terms of use,’ they have to prove that,” he said. “We have to have the right to contest this and present our case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Ross, a professor of social and cultural analysis at NYU who organized the event &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.nyu-aaup.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in conjunction with&lt;/a&gt; the American Association of University Professors, called the situation “absurdist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone working in higher education right now depends on Zoom and we cannot be in a position of allowing a corporate, third-party vendor to make these kinds of decisions,” Ross said. “It’s simply unsustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross added that he asked the tech worker who was helping organize the event to check whether the link was active the night before it was set to go live because the event for the University of Hawaii had already been affected. It was fine at that point, but by early afternoon Friday, it had disappeared and there was no option to restore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Universities tend to get into these lucrative contracts with Zoom, and more or less handed over this very fragile power to decide what is acceptable academic speech and what is not,” said Ross. “For those of us who work in the field of supporting and protecting Palestinian rights, it's no surprise to us that Palestinian speech is the first to be cracked down on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYU event eventually went on with Google Meet, but the effort was intercepted by “politically-motivated trolls,” Ross said, and the organizers had to hold it privately and then publish the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Franklin, a professor at the University of Hawaii, also saw an event she organized deleted by Zoom, but was unable to find an alternative platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that I have free speech rights that are being violated,” she said, “and a private entity is dictating to my public university what I can and cannot say.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katherine Franke, a professor at Columbia University who was a panelist at the NYU talk, has experienced events focused on Palestive being canceled in the past and was recently deported from Israel. She sees Zoom’s reaction as an extension of old problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it presents a real challenge for universities to think about how to protect academic freedom in this context where we're so dependent upon these internet-based ways of gathering and talking about comfortable and uncomfortable ideas,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Washington crews destroy first U.S. “murder hornet” nest</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/washington-state-murder-hornets-nest-photos-39e04acb-50da-4c3d-8a8d-4993e1fe2780.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Heavily protected crews on Saturday dismantled the first Asian giant hornet nest found in the U.S., the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) confirmed in a statement declaring: &quot;Got 'em.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; The invasive species commonly referred to as the &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;murder hornet&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/asian-giant-murder-hornets-usa-44dc4691-0996-41bd-805a-af614e2620fa.html&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/asian-giant-murder-hornets-usa-44dc4691-0996-41bd-805a-af614e2620fa.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;murder hornet&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; typically doesn't harm humans unless provoked, though it has been &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;known to kill people&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15563650701664871&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15563650701664871&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;known to kill people&lt;/a&gt; in Japan.

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ahmadhaghighi.com/blog/2020/gitlab/</guid>
<description>&lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;On 3rd Oct. 2020 GitLab blocked Iranians’ access (based on IP) without any prior notice! and five days later (8th Oct.) my friend’s account blocked and still he doesn’t have any access to his projects! even after creating a ticket and asks for a temporary access to only export his projects! &lt;strong&gt;GitLab refused to unblock him!&lt;/strong&gt; (screenshot in appendix). My friend is not the only one who blocked by GitLab, with a simple search on the web you can find a growing list of blocked accounts.&lt;br/&gt;So I decided to move from GtiLab and EVERY Free Software based/hosted/managed on/in USA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;When it comes to USA policies, Free Software is a Joke :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;GitLab is not the only actor in this discrimination against Persian/Iranian people, we also blocked by GitHub, Docker, NPM, Google Developer, Android, AWS, Go, Kubernetes and etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;But I believe in Freedom and Free Software.

<title>Hackers hijack and publish mental health data of hundreds of people</title>
<link>https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/national/scandal-over-the-hijack-and-and-publication-of-private-mental-health-data/20201023121903008599.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/national/scandal-over-the-hijack-and-and-publication-of-private-mental-health-data/20201023121903008599.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the &lt;strong&gt;extortion of a group of hackers&lt;/strong&gt; to a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of &lt;strong&gt;the company Vastaamo&lt;/strong&gt; after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as &lt;strong&gt;depression and anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;. Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish &lt;strong&gt;Social Security (Kela)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extortionists demanded around &lt;strong&gt;450,000 euros (in bitcoins)&lt;/strong&gt; in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminals started to publish &lt;strong&gt;the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor &lt;/strong&gt;two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until they received the money. As the company was resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200 people - including minors - have been released online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information published could not be more sensitive: it included the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together &lt;strong&gt;with the content of the therapy sessions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers. The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter. Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner. In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts,&quot; the company said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rumours of ransom payment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data of &lt;strong&gt;another 100 people were published on Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this article, the company had neither confirmed nor denied the payment. &lt;strong&gt;Tuomas Kahri&lt;/strong&gt;, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that &lt;strong&gt;he would not comment on the ransom payment&lt;/strong&gt; allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ilta Sanomat&lt;/strong&gt; exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by &lt;strong&gt;paying about 540 euros in bitcoins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Police investigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)&lt;/strong&gt; is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The X.Org Server Is Abandonware?</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=XServer-Abandonware</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=XServer-Abandonware</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;X.ORG -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/xorg.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The last major release of the X.Org Server was in May 2018 but don't expect the long-awaited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&amp;amp;q=X.Org+Server+1.21&quot;&gt;X.Org Server 1.21&lt;/a&gt; to actually be released anytime soon.&lt;p&gt;This should hardly be surprising but a prominent Intel open-source developer has conceded that the X.Org Server is pretty much &quot;abandonware&quot; with Wayland being the future. This comes as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=X.Org-Server-2019-Low&quot;&gt;X.Org Server development hits a nearly two decade low&lt;/a&gt;, the X.Org Server is well off its six month release regiment in not seeing a major release in over two years, and no one is stepping up to manage the 1.21 release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago was a proposal to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Xorg-Server-CI-Driven-Releases&quot;&gt;new releases driven via continuous integration testing&lt;/a&gt; but even that didn't take flight and as we roll into 2021 there isn't any motivation for releasing new versions of the X.Org Server by those capable of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat folks have long stepped up to manage X.Org Server releases but with Fedora Workstation using Wayland by default and RHEL working that way, they haven't been eager to devote resources to new X.Org Server releases. Other major stakeholders also have resisted stepping up to ship 1.21 or commit any major resources to new xorg-server versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week was a tentative merge request for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/533#note_670522&quot;&gt;allowing atomic support in the xf86-video-modesetting DDX&lt;/a&gt;. It's actually about partially restoring the support (and not enabled by default) after the atomic code was previously disabled over bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Vetter of Intel's kernel graphics driver team and DRM co-maintainer commented, &quot;&lt;em&gt;The main worry I have is that xserver is abandonware without even regular releases from the main branch. That's why we had to blacklist X. Without someone caring I think there's just largely downsides to enabling features.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (Then again, that coming from an Intel Linux developer isn't too surprising considering it's been more than six years since the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel/&quot;&gt;xf86-video-intel&lt;/a&gt; DDX release.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the likes of Red Hat, Intel has been the only other major organization in recent time willing to devote resources to areas like X.Org release management, but even while they let go some of their Wayland folks years ago, they seem uninterested in devoting much in the way of the X.Org Server advancements as we approach 2021. With Ubuntu 21.04 also possibly defaulting to Wayland for its GNOME session, the KDE Wayland support getting squared away, and other advancements continuing, X.Org Server 1.21 may very well prove to be an elusive release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
