<title>How to build a plugin system on the web and also sleep well at night</title>

<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-2-copying-the-scene-is-expensive&quot; class=&quot;css-tatx5o&quot;&gt;Problem #2: copying the scene is expensive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;The second problem with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; approach is that it requires serializing large parts of the document before sending them to the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;It turns out that people can create very, very large documents in Figma to the point of hitting memory limits. For example, on Microsoft’s design systems file (which we spent a month optimizing last year), it took 14 seconds just to serialize the document and send it to the plugin, &lt;em&gt;before the plugin could even run&lt;/em&gt;. Given that most plugins are going to involve quick actions like “swap two items in my selection”, this would make plugins unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading the data incrementally or lazily also isn’t really an option, because:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;css-1c1hft1&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;It would involve months of re-architecting the core product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Any API that may need to wait on a piece of data that hasn’t arrived yet will now be asynchronous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;In summary, because Figma documents can have really large amount of data with a lot of interdependencies, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; wasn’t going to work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; approach having been ruled out, we had to backtrack in our research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;We went back to the drawing board and spent two long weeks discussing a variety of approaches. As the simple solution didn’t work out, we had to give serious consideration to more exotic ideas. There were many — too many to fill the margins of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;But most approaches had one or more major disqualifying flaws:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1bcf4ob&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Have an API that would be too difficult to use (e.g. accessing the document using a REST API or GraphQL like method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Depends on browser features that browser vendors have removed or are trying to (e.g. synchronous xhr + service worker, shared buffers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Requires significant research work or re-architecting of our application that could take months before we can even validate that it can work (e.g. load a copy of Figma in an iframe + sync via CRDTs, hack green threads into JavaScript with generators by cross-compiling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, we concluded that we had to find a way to create a model where plugins can directly manipulate the document. Writing a plugin should feel like a designer automating their actions. So we knew we’d have to allow plugins to run on the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-running-on-the-main-thread&quot; class=&quot;css-tatx5o&quot;&gt;Implications of running on the main thread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Before we dive into Attempt #2, we need to take a step back and re-examine what it means to allow plugins to run on the main thread. After all, we didn’t consider it at first because we knew that it could be dangerous. Running on the main thread sounds an awful lot like &lt;code&gt;eval(UNSAFE_CODE)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The benefits of running on the main thread are that plugins can:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;css-1c1hft1&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Directly edit the document rather than a copy of it, eliminating loading time issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Run our complex component updating and constraints logic without needing to have two copies of that code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Make synchronous API calls in situations where you’d expect a synchronous API. There would be no confusion with loading or flushing updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Be written in a more intuitive way: plugins are just automating actions that the user would otherwise do manually using our UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, now we have these problems:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;css-1c1hft1&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Plugins can hang, and there is no way to interrupt a plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Plugins can make network requests as figma.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Plugins can access and modify global state. This includes modifying our UI, creating dependencies on internal application state outside the API, or doing downright malicious things like changing the value of &lt;code&gt;({}).__proto__&lt;/code&gt; which poisons every new and existing JavaScript object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;We decided that we could drop the requirement for (1). When plugins freeze, it affects the perceived stability of Figma. However, our plugin model works such that they are only ever run on explicit user action. By changing the UI when a plugin runs, freezes would always be attributed to the plugin. It also means that it is not possible for a plugin to “break” a document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-it-mean-for-eval-to-be-dangerous&quot; class=&quot;css-tatx5o&quot;&gt;What does it mean for &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; to be dangerous?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;To deal with the issue of plugins being able to make network requests and access global state, we must first understand exactly what it means that “eval arbitrary JavaScript code is dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;If a variant of JavaScript, let’s call it SimpleScript, had only the ability to do arithmetic such &lt;code&gt;7 * 24 * 60 * 60&lt;/code&gt;, it would be quite safe to &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;You can add some features to SimpleScript like variable assignment and if statements to make it more like a programming language, and it would still be very safe. At the end of the day, it still essentially boils down to doing arithmetic. Add function evaluation, and now you have lambda calculus and Turing completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;In other words, JavaScript doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be dangerous. In its most reductionist form, it’s merely an extended way of doing arithmetics. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerous is when it has access to input &amp;amp; output. This includes network access, DOM access, etc. It’s &lt;strong&gt;Browser APIs&lt;/strong&gt; that are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;And APIs are all global variables. So hide the global variables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiding-the-global-variables&quot; class=&quot;css-tatx5o&quot;&gt;Hiding the global variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Now, hiding the global variables sounds good in theory, but it’s difficult to create secure implementations by merely “hiding” them. You might consider, for example, removing all properties on the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object, or setting them to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but the code could still get access to global values such as &lt;code&gt;({}).constructor&lt;/code&gt;. It would be very challenging to find all the possible ways in which some global value might leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Rather, we need some stronger form of sandboxing where those global values never existed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-module--blockquoteContainer--3SVVf&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-module--blockquote--1I9Ja blockquote-module--tdes20--3hTlJ blockquote-module--tmob18--3EwSh&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;In other words, JavaScript doesn’t have to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Consider the previous example of a hypothetical SimpleScript that only supports arithmetic. It’s a straightforward CS 101 exercise to write an arithmetic evaluation program. In any reasonable implementation of this program, SimpleScript would simply be unable to do anything other than arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Now, expand SimpleScript to support more language features until it becomes JavaScript, and this program is called an &lt;strong&gt;interpreter&lt;/strong&gt;, which is how JavaScript, a dynamic interpreted language, is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Implementing JavaScript is too much work for a small startup like ours. Instead, to validate this approach, we took &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/svaarala/duktape&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;Duktape&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight JavaScript interpreter written in C++ and compiled it to WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;To confirm that it works, we ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/es5-tests&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;test262&lt;/a&gt; on it, the standard JavaScript test suite. It passes all ES5 tests except for a few unimportant test failures. To run plugin code with Duktape, we would call the &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; function of &lt;em&gt;the compiled interpreter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the properties of this approach?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1bcf4ob&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;This interpreter runs in the main thread, which means we can create a main-thread based API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;It’s secure in a way that’s easy to reason about. Duktape does not support any browser APIs — and that’s a feature! Furthermore, it runs as WebAssembly which itself is a sandboxed environment that has no access to browser APIs. In other words, plugin code can communicate with the outside world only through explicit whitelisted APIs by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;It’s slower than regular JavaScript since this interpreter is not a JIT, but that’s ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;It requires the browser to compile a medium-size WASM binary, which has some cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Browser debugging tools don’t work by default, but we spent a day implementing a console for the interpreter to validate that it’d be at least possible to debug plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-1ihnge6&quot;&gt;Duktape only supports ES5, but it’s already common practice in the web community to cross-compile newer JavaScript versions using tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;(Aside: a few months later, Fabrice Bellard released &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/quickjs/&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;QuickJS&lt;/a&gt; which supports ES6 natively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;Now, compiling a JavaScript interpreter! Depending on your inclinations or aesthetics as a programmer, you might either think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;THIS IS AWESOME! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;…really? A JavaScript engine in a browser that &lt;em&gt;already has a JavaScript engine?&lt;/em&gt; 🤨. What next, an operating system in a browser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;And some amount of suspicion is healthy! It is best to avoid re-implementing the browser unless we absolutely have to. We already spent a lot of effort &lt;a class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot; href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;implementing an entire rendering system&lt;/a&gt;. It was necessary for performance and cross-browser support and are glad we did it, but we still try to not re-invent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not the approach we ended up going with.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s an even better approach. However, it was important to cover as a step towards understanding our final sandboxing model which is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;While we had a promising approach compiling a JS interpreter, there was one more tool to look at. We found a technology called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;Realms shim&lt;/a&gt; created by the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://agoric.com&quot; class=&quot;text_block-module--inlineLink--3BpRh&quot;&gt;Agoric&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text_block-module--paragraph--1anyX&quot;&gt;This technology describes creating a sandbox and supporting plugins as a potential use case. A promising description! The Realms API looks roughly like this:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Tarahumara woman won a Mexican ultramarathon in sandals (2017)</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;sumario__interior&quot;&gt;
&lt;header class=&quot;sumario-encabezado&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;sumario-titulo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sin_enlace&quot;&gt;en español&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The image of Ramírez receiving her medal on the podium has been shared nearly 100,000 times on Facebook since May 13, since which time the news has spread across the world. It was first published on the Facebook page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/quetodotehuacan/&quot;&gt;Que Todo Tehuacán Se Entere&lt;/a&gt; – dedicated to local news from Tehuacán, Puebla’s second-biggest city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post drew attention to the fact that Ramírez won “without a hydration vest, special running shoes, Lycra or compression sleeves… Without any of the gadgets used by runners today. Without publishing her kilometers run on Nike or uploading her achievements on Facebook, out of sheer necessity she won.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sumario_html centro&quot; id=&quot;sumario_5|html&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;nota_pie&quot;&gt;The Facebook post announcing Ramirez's victory in the women’s 50km #UltraTrailCerroRojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner, who like many Rarámuri comes from the Tarahumara mountains in Chihuahua, looks serious as she holds a piece of paper saying that she will receive 6,000 pesos for her achievement – slightly less than €300. Instead of sports clothes and running shoes, she is dressed in a skirt and a pair of sandals with soles made from recycled tire rubber. These are the shoes she ran in for seven hours and three minutes. They are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/03/30/inenglish/1459345993_518145.html&quot;&gt;everyday footwear of many Tarahumara indigenous runners&lt;/a&gt; who are used to jogging between the gullies of the Chihuahua mountains. Last year, Ramírez came second in the 100km category of Chihuahua state’s Caballo Blanco 2016 ultramarathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sumario_foto centro&quot; id=&quot;sumario_1|foto&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sumario__interior&quot;&gt;&lt;img onload=&quot;lzld(this)&quot; src=&quot;https://ep00.epimg.net/t.gif&quot; data-src=&quot;//ep01.epimg.net/verne/imagenes/2017/05/18/mexico/1495129378_181922_1495149980_sumario_normal.jpg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;374&quot; alt=&quot;How a Tarahumara woman won a Mexican ultramarathon in sandals&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;foto-firma&quot;&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;author&quot; class=&quot;foto-autor&quot;&gt;Courtesty of Danai García Fotografix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She had no special gear,” says Orlando Jiménez, the race organizer. “She doesn't have energy sweets or gel or the expensive shoes so many use for running in the mountains. All she has is a small bottle of water, a hat and a scarf that she wears around her neck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mexico’s best runners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-distance running is in the blood in the Ramírez family. Her older brother Mario was among the competitors in Puebla, coming 10th in the 30-kilometer category. Meanwhile, three of Lorena’s seven siblings as well as her father, Santiago, ran with her in the Chihuahua ultramarathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;El Universal&lt;/em&gt; daily, Santiago explained he had been running since he was a child, just as his father and grandfather had done before him. They were, he explained, motivated by “not losing” and “not going hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the race in Puebla, Lorena and her brother made a two-day overland trip from their community in Ciénega de Norogachi in the municipality of Guachochi, to the State of Mexico. They were then picked up by the runner, Leonel Aparicio and traveled another five hours by car to Pueblo Mágico. The following day, Loretta ran 50 kilometers to become champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sumario_foto centro&quot; id=&quot;sumario_4|foto&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sumario__interior&quot;&gt;&lt;img onload=&quot;lzld(this)&quot; src=&quot;https://ep00.epimg.net/t.gif&quot; data-src=&quot;//ep01.epimg.net/verne/imagenes/2017/05/18/mexico/1495129378_181922_1495151785_sumario_normal.jpg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;841&quot; alt=&quot;Lorena and Mario Ramírez with the race organizer.&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;foto-texto&quot;&gt;Lorena and Mario Ramírez with the race organizer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;foto-firma&quot;&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;author&quot; class=&quot;foto-autor&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Danai García Fotografix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;EL PAÍS tried to contact Lorena on her brother's cellphone but without success as the signal is poor in the Chihuahua mountains. But Aparicio told us: “At home, Lorena looks after the stock. She has cows and goats and walks between 10 and 15 kilometers a day with the animals.” To keep hydrated, the Tarahumara runners eat &lt;em&gt;pinole&lt;/em&gt;, a corn paste, which is also part of their daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are naturally the best runners in Mexico,” says Jiménez. In fact, the clue is in their name, Rarámuri. &lt;em&gt;Rara&lt;/em&gt; means feet and &lt;em&gt;muri&lt;/em&gt; means to run. The Rarámuri are a people of “light feet” or “running feet” and their history and running techniques became famous after Christopher McDougall wrote about them in his book &lt;em&gt;Born to Run&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Privacy Sandbox – Open standards to enhance privacy on the web</title>
<link>https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy is paramount to us, in everything we do. So today, we are announcing a new initiative to develop a set of open standards to fundamentally enhance privacy on the web. We’re calling this a Privacy Sandbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology that publishers and advertisers use to make advertising even more relevant to people is now being used far beyond its original design intent - to a point where some data practices don’t match up to user expectations for privacy. Recently, some other browsers have attempted to address this problem, but without an agreed upon set of standards, attempts to improve user privacy are having unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, large scale blocking of cookies undermine people’s privacy by encouraging opaque techniques such as fingerprinting. With fingerprinting, developers have found ways to use tiny bits of information that vary between users, such as what device they have or what fonts they have installed to generate a unique identifier which can then be used to match a user across websites. Unlike cookies, users cannot clear their fingerprint, and therefore cannot control how their information is collected. We think this subverts user choice and is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, blocking cookies without another way to deliver relevant ads significantly reduces publishers’ primary means of funding, which jeopardizes the future of the vibrant web. Many publishers have been able to continue to invest in freely accessible content because they can be confident that their advertising will fund their costs. If this funding is cut, we are concerned that we will see much less accessible content for everyone. Recent studies have shown that when advertising is made less relevant by removing cookies, funding for publishers falls by 52% on average&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are doing something different. We want to find a solution that both really protects user privacy and also helps content remain freely accessible on the web. At I/O, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html&quot;&gt;we announced a plan&lt;/a&gt; to improve the classification of cookies, give clarity and visibility to cookie settings, as well as plans to more aggressively block fingerprinting. We are making progress on this, and today we are providing more details on our plans to restrict fingerprinting. Collectively we believe all these changes will improve transparency, choice, and control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we can go further. Starting with today’s announcements, we will work with the web community to develop new standards that advance privacy, while continuing to support free access to content. Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve started sharing our preliminary ideas for a Privacy Sandbox - a secure environment for personalization that also protects user privacy. Some ideas include new approaches to ensure that ads continue to be relevant for users, but user data shared with websites and advertisers would be minimized by anonymously aggregating user information, and keeping much more user information on-device only. Our goal is to create a set of standards that is more consistent with users’ expectations of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are following the web standards process and seeking industry feedback on our initial ideas for the Privacy Sandbox. While Chrome can take action quickly in some areas (for instance, restrictions on fingerprinting) developing web standards is a complex process, and we know from experience that ecosystem changes of this scope take time. They require significant thought, debate, and input from many stakeholders, and generally take multiple years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move things forward as quickly as possible, we have documented the specific problems we are trying to solve together, and we are sharing a series of explainers with the web community. We have also summarized these ideas today on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html&quot;&gt;Chromium blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to getting feedback on this approach from the web platform community, including other browsers, publishers, and their advertising partners. Thank you in advance for your help and input on this process - we believe that we must solve these problems together to ensure that the incredible benefits of the open, accessible web continue into the next generation of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cryptic, allusive messages from Hong Kong&amp;#039;s wealthiest tycoon</title>
<link>https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44024</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44024</guid>
<description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;« &lt;a href=&quot;https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44002&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44076&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt; »&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have been wondering when Hong Kong's magnates would speak out on the prolonged protests in their city.  Finally one has.  That's Li Ka-shing, the richest of them all:  &quot;HK Billionaire Li Ka-Shing Breaks Silence Over Protests&quot; (8/15/19 newscast on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRHr-jT1PD0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZRHr-jT1PD0&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNECytChdPm5MD3UlEuvPp0BhJFg9g&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;).  He took out full page advertisements (both seem to be on the front page) in two of Hong Kong's most influential financial newspapers:  Hong Kong Economic Times and Hong Kong Economic Journal.  Here's the first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Click to embiggen&quot; src=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-44024&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks straightforward, simple, and heartfelt, with that big crossed-out &quot;bàolì 暴力&quot; (&quot;[NO] violence&quot;) in the center of a big, red circle.  Here's the rest of the entire text, which looks innocent and innocuous enough, especially with the striking repetition of &quot;ài 愛&quot; (&quot;love&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zuì hǎo de yīn&lt;br /&gt;kě chéng zuì huài de guǒ&lt;br /&gt;最好的因&lt;br /&gt;可成最壞的果&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The best cause&lt;br /&gt;can become the worst result&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ài Zhōngguó&lt;br /&gt;ài Xiānggǎng&lt;br /&gt;ài zìjǐ&lt;br /&gt;愛中國&lt;br /&gt;愛香港&lt;br /&gt;愛自己&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Love China&lt;br /&gt;Love Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;Love yourself&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ài zìyóu&lt;br /&gt;ài bāoróng&lt;br /&gt;ài fǎzhì&lt;br /&gt;愛自由&lt;br /&gt;愛包容&lt;br /&gt;愛法治&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Love freedom&lt;br /&gt;Love tolerance / inclusivity&lt;br /&gt;Love rule of law&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yǐ ài zhī yì&lt;br /&gt;zhǐxī nùfèn&lt;br /&gt;以愛之義&lt;br /&gt;止息怒憤&lt;br /&gt;&quot;With loving justice&lt;br /&gt;Stop anger&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yīgè Xiānggǎng shìmín Lǐ Jiāchéng&lt;br /&gt;一個香港市民李嘉誠&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A citizen of Hong Kong, Li Ka-shing&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the end of it.  No sooner had Li Ka-shing's ad been published than sharp netizens began to see that it contained an artfully constructed hidden message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Click to embiggen&quot; src=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we extract the final characters of the eight lines of the text, we obtain this powerful advice from Li Ka-shing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yīnguǒ yóu guó&lt;br /&gt;róng gǎng zhìjǐ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;ZH-CN&quot; xml:lang=&quot;ZH-CN&quot; xml:lang=&quot;ZH-CN&quot;&gt;因果由國&lt;br /&gt;容港治己&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The cause and the result depend upon China ([Zhōng]guó [中]國)&lt;br /&gt;let Hong Kong rule itself&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two characters of the two phrases of the bottom horizontal line above Li's signature are being widely interpreted as &quot;yìfèn 義憤&quot; (&quot;righteous indignation&quot;).  Some decoders are reading the last two characters of the two parts of the signature line as mín chéng 民誠 (&quot;sincerity of the people&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this may be going too far, but numerologists are seeing that the first horizontal line has 4 characters, the second has 6, the third horizontal line has 8 characters, and the last horizontal line has 9 characters, and everyone knows what 4 / 6 / 89 signifies.  Moreover, the symbolism of 4 / 6 / 89 is reinforced by the 6 ài 愛 (&quot;love&quot;) characters separated by 4 dots.  Last, there is a wish for prohibition of red at the very center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the second of Li Ka-shing's two ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Click to embiggen&quot; src=&quot;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/likashing3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite a different genre, but equally subtle and suggestive.  It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huángtái zhī guā,&lt;br /&gt;hé kān zài zhāi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;黃台之瓜，&lt;br /&gt;何堪再摘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The melon of Huangtai&lt;br /&gt;cannot endure further picking&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem is by the dauphin (crown prince), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Zhanghuai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Zhanghuai&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNERVIykkbFPeX1XPNQR2noodwR8RQ&quot;&gt;Li Xian&lt;/a&gt; (655-684) under &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEiH-CrCi9h9DDiKQZn2iParVCTAA&quot;&gt;Wu Zetian&lt;/a&gt; (624-705), the only female emperor in Chinese history.  In the fierce factional and internecine politics at her court, she repeatedly picked at the crown prince, to the point that she hounded him to commit suicide.  Her murderous maneuvering was all for the purpose of consolidating her supreme power.  &quot;The melon of Huangtai&quot; is a reference to the crown prince himself.  Not long after the crown prince's demise, her usurpatory rule came to an ignominious end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two lines of the poem are preceded by this remark of Li Ka-shing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zhèngrú wǒ zhīqián jiǎngguò / Cant. zing3 jyu4 ngo5 zi1 cin4 gong2 gwo3 (although there are no overt lexical items that would mark this as Cantonese)&lt;br /&gt;正如我之前講過&lt;br /&gt;(&quot;Just as I have said before&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Li Ka-shing has quoted this poem at strategic moments in the past, such as in 2016, when he was asked whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leung_Chun-ying&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leung_Chun-ying&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFAtzSvFB-PQ2Vo7q5yv1Mu0oVWBQ&quot;&gt;Leung Chun-ying&lt;/a&gt;, who was Hong Kong chief executive at the time, but who had been discredited by his handling of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGJj2xrRUOi-Mdt-e9gzDNg42ASSA&quot;&gt;Umbrella Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 and large scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Mong_Kok_civil_unrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Mong_Kok_civil_unrest&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF0vQnH03uckVQlTTCZRR2KO4Jz5g&quot;&gt;civil unrest in Mong Kok&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, whether &quot;CY&quot; would run for a second term.  Since the lines quoted can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending upon the circumstances, but usually imply that someone should not persist in a course of action that has shown itself to be unsuccessful.  In the present case, it could be interpreted to mean that current HK chief executive Carrie Lam and PRC president Xi JInping should withdraw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_extradition_bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_extradition_bill&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGhm8DHcw0E8xqiwcc1rYbR5nAMsQ&quot;&gt;extradition bill&lt;/a&gt; completely and take steps to satisfy other requests the protesters have made.  Otherwise, if they keep picking at the Hong Kong melon, the vine is likely to wither and die.  I don't believe anyone in his / her right mind wants that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that China's netizens are overthinking what Li Ka-shing intended by his two full-page newspaper advertisements, but I don't think so.  The PRC government has completely blocked all references to his pleas for peace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3023037/melon-huangtai-hong-kong-business-leader-li-ka-shing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3023037/melon-huangtai-hong-kong-business-leader-li-ka-shing&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1566186461720000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH94fatuTtXIsOFZuYf-O5tOvsU8A&quot;&gt;Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's poetic call for peace blocked on Chinese social media&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, by Chow Chung-yan, SCMP (8/16/19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hashtag #LiKa-shingSpeakingOut recently was one of the most searched-for phrases on Weibo (huge microblogging site), until it was taken down, no doubt at the demand of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to June Teufel Dreyer, John Lagerwey, and Abraham Chan]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Fuller account of the context for the original composition of the &quot;Melon of Huangtai&quot; (Huángtái guā cí 黃台瓜辭) from the SCMP article cited just above.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem was written by Li Xian, the crown prince of the Tang dynasty who lived between 654 and 684AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth son of emperor Gaozong and the second son of the legendary empress Wu Zetian, Li Xian was known as an intelligent and capable prince. As his brothers fell one by one in a Byzantine court intrigue, he was installed as the crown prince and the heir apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his ambitious mother concentrated all of the power in her hands as her ailing husband succumbed to illness. She became suspicious of Li Xian and put him under house arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In desperation, Li wrote the poem as a subtle protest to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing melons beneath Huangtai,&lt;br /&gt;Hanging heavily, many grow ripe,&lt;br /&gt;Pick one, the others will be fine,&lt;br /&gt;Pick two, fewer are left on the vine,&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get yet another one,&lt;br /&gt;That's where we must draw the line,&lt;br /&gt;For if there is any more reaping,&lt;br /&gt;You will end up with an empty vine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prince's lament did not move his mother. The empress accused Li Xian of treason and he was sent into exile. In 684, shortly after his father's death, empress Wu forced her son to commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melon of Huangtai, however, became a popular expression in Chinese culture, symbolising suffering in the face of persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Productivity and the Workweek (2000)</title>

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;20px&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;55.576383014718&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/%7Erauch&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erik Rauch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if, instead of using productivity increases to buy more possessions, we used them to get more time instead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity has been increasing exponentially for more than a century. This is one of the most remarkable developments of all time. Until a few decades ago, this bounty has been used both for increased material comfort and for more time. However, in recent decades, the increase has been used exclusively to purchase more things; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2004/07/productivity_or.html&quot;&gt;hours have actually increased in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/conferences/socialcapital/Happiness%20Readings/Diener_Biswas-Diener_2002.pdf&quot;&gt;there has been little increase in subjective well-being in developed countries in recent decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average worker needs to work a mere 11 hours per week to produce as much as one working 40 hours per week in 1950. (The data here is from the US, but productivity increases in Europe and Japan have been of the same magnitude.) The conclusion is inescapable: if productivity means anything at all, a worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as a 1950 worker in only 11 hours per week. The following shows the number of hours per week needed to produce as much as a 1950 worker, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/misc/worktime/output_per_hour.pdf&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bls.gov/opub/rtaw/stattab3.htm&quot;&gt;US Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, including both manufacuring and services:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/misc/worktime/1950_reduction.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number of hours per week needed to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;produce as much as a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;40-hour worker in 1950&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In other words, the number of weekly hours needed to produce the 1950 worker's output declined by almost &lt;em&gt;one hour per year&lt;/em&gt; until the mid-1970's, and has been declining by about half an hour per year since then.&lt;p&gt;Polls and surveys have shown that people in countries with the standard of living that the US enjoyed in the 1950's are no less satisfied than today's Americans. Indeed, many studies show that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/conferences/socialcapital/Happiness%20Readings/Diener_Biswas-Diener_2002.pdf&quot;&gt;income increases people's subjective well-being only up to the point where basic needs are met&lt;/a&gt;. However, productivity has increased so much that we can have both the extra possessions and the extra time. Even since 1975, supposedly an era of low productivity growth and stagnation in living standards, officially measured productivity has increased almost 70%. The average worker would therefore need to work only 23 hours per week to produce as much as one working as recently as 1975:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/misc/worktime/1975_reduction.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number of hours per week needed to produce as much as a 40-hour worker in 1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;And, if the productivity measures have any meaning, the average worker could have a 29-hour workweek if he were satisfied with producing as much as a 40-hour worker as recently as 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast productivity growth is not necessary for reduced work time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
Much is made of the rate of productivity growth and its relationship to worker well-being. Overlooked is a much more important fact: because productivity has been growing for so long, it is now so high that it can enable us to sharply reduce working hours while maintaining a high material standard of living. The most important thing is not how fast productivity is growing, but that it is &lt;span&gt;already&lt;/span&gt; high enough. We don't need to wait for future productivity increases: the necessary increases have already happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shorter hours and the notion of progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Elsa/bkh/lla/eosh.htm&quot;&gt;an article on labor history&lt;/a&gt; notes, shorter hours were assumed to be a natural consequence of increased productivity in the US until the 1930's, appearing in the platforms of all major parties, and the above shows how the workweek would have evolved had the trend continued after World War II. In Europe, reduced worktime has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.web.net/32hours/takingup.htm&quot;&gt;continued to be an issue&lt;/a&gt;, and the workweek has been declining in recent times, unlike in the US. However, even in Europe, the decline in work time has fallen far behind the increase in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits from productivity increases&lt;/h2&gt;
According to official statistics, &quot;labor's&quot; share of national income in the US has remained constant over the last 50 years. &quot;Labor&quot;, however, includes everyone up to Bill Gates. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/therich.html&quot;&gt;troubling increase in income inequality&lt;/a&gt; in the United States means that many people do not share in the benefits of productivity increases. However, the potential is there. Furthermore, the increase in inequality is mainly an American phenomenon: it has not occurred, or has occurred on a much smaller scale, in other advanced countries.
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
The march of productivity is such that its increase in even as short a time span as a decade could be used to dramatically reduce working hours while living standards remained constant.&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Postscript&lt;/h2&gt;
How long can the growth continue? Even if the supposedly slow rate of increase in recent times were continued, productivity would increase 120% in the next 50 years, and a 2050 worker would need to work 15 hours to have the same real income as a 1990 worker (or less than 6 hours to have the same income as the 1950 worker):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/misc/worktime/projection.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output per hour, projected based on 1975-2000 rate of increase; 1995 = 100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, here we may have stretched the usefulness of the official definition of productivity much too far, and exponential growth cannot continue forever, but however productivity is measured, the increase and its relationship to the potential for workweek reduction is too big to ignore.&lt;h3&gt;See also:&lt;/h3&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;et-boc&quot; class=&quot;et-boc&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_builder_inner_content et_pb_gutters3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_section et_pb_section_0 et_section_regular et_section_transparent&quot; data-padding=&quot;0px|||&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_row et_pb_row_0&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_column et_pb_column_3_4 et_pb_column_0 et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is about using sample data to build mathematical models that enable computer systems to perform tasks without obtaining explicit instructions. Image recognition, self-driving vehicles, Internet search engines, computer vision, spam email filtering, and many other systems use machine learning. It’s also applied in financial forecasts, medical diagnostics, fraud detection, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a vast and promising area. It offers exciting solutions to real-world problems as well as a variety of well-paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about learning and starting a career in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you should learn the fundamentals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the theory and intuition behind data science and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn libraries for data science and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice by playing with data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got the foundations, you should always learn more and keep yourself up-to-date by following the progress in the area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence blogs and papers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow interesting people, groups, companies, and organizations on Twitter and other social networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include yourself in discussions, ask questions, give the answers to other people’s questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the article is about the first part: building the fundaments of your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of mathematics is very important for people into data science and machine learning. It allows them to understand in-depth how and why the machine learning methods function. It also allows one to correctly design experiments, test hypotheses, combine methods, optimize hyperparameters, an so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three main branches of mathematics required for machine learning are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability and statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculus&lt;/strong&gt; is important because everything else relies on it, especially probability theory, statistical methods, and convex optimization. There are many potentially useful calculus books like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculus by J. Stewart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas’ Calculus by G.B. Thomas, M.D. Weir, and J.R. Hass; please note that the latest edition of this book is authored by J.R. Hass, C.E. Heil, and M.D. Weir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner, you can try the tutorial Calculus for Beginners and Artists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear algebra&lt;/strong&gt; is the basis of many machine learning methods and approaches such as linear regression and linear discriminant analysis. It’ll teach you how to handle multi-dimensional data and how to find relations between them. Some recommended books in linear algebra are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra and Its Applications by D.C. Lay, S.R. Lay, and J.J. McDonald&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Linear Algebra by G. Strang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra and Its Applications by G. Strang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra and Learning from Data by G. Strang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also find beneficial the YouTube lectures of prof. G. Strang from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology available on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The theory of probability and statistics&lt;/strong&gt; have many concepts used in machine learning. Conditional probability, the Bayes theorem, the central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, regression techniques, and the entropy of information are just several examples of such concepts. Some convenient books about probability and statistics are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists by S.M. Ross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences by J.L. Devore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a high knowledge level in mathematics to start with machine learning, but once you want to understand and perform some serious stuff, you’ll feel the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn the Theory and Intuition behind Data Science and Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to get the insight in the applied aspect of mathematical concepts, that is to understand precisely how machine learning methods are designed. Some good books about these concepts are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Introduction to Statistical Learning by P. Forrest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshriani&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also two fantastic, free, online books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Networks and Deep Learning by M. Nielsen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll find many good explanations and visual representations there.The notes from the machine learning courses are freely available from the Web sites of the Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The lectures of these courses are also freely available on YouTube. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duomly.com/register&quot;&gt;Duomly&lt;/a&gt; offers a comprehensive course on machine learning, as well as several articles you might find useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They explain the intuition behind the machine learning methods and provide their step-by-step implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn Libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things is to master programming libraries for data science and machine learning. The leading Python libraries for this purpose are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NumPy&lt;/strong&gt; is a fundamental and high-performance Python library for manipulating arrays and numerical computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SciPy&lt;/strong&gt; is a comprehensive library for numerical computing based on and extending NumPy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandas&lt;/strong&gt; is a library for easy and intuitive manipulation of one- and two-dimensional labeled data, also related to NumPy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scikit-learn&lt;/strong&gt; is a comprehensive and widely-used machine learning library built on top NumPy and SciPy for data preprocessing, regression, classification, cluster analysis, model selection, and dimensionality reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/strong&gt; is a deep learning library focused primarily on neural networks by Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keras&lt;/strong&gt; is a library for creating and training neural networks that can be used with the TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano backends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/strong&gt; is a powerful and widely-used library for data visualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bokeh&lt;/strong&gt; is a library for interactive data visualization and presentation in the Web browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official Web sites usually provide good and free documentation and tutorials for each of these libraries. One additional especially good tutorial is the Anatomy of Matplotlib. It’s freely available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more about JavaScript machine learning libraries, please, check Duomly’s article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.duomly.com/6-top-machine-learning-libraries-for-javascript-in-2019/&quot;&gt;6 Top Machine Learning Libraries For Javascript in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice by Playing with Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to become an expert in any area, you have to practice a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should get an interesting dataset. It may be related to sports, medicine, weather, finances, government, just anything you’re passionate about. Then, you can use it to do some data cleaning, data standardization, regression, classification, cluster analysis, pattern recognition, association rule learning, dimensionality reduction, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download free datasets from many websites like Kaggle, FiveThirtyEight, Socrata OpenData, Wikipedia, UCI Machine Learning Repository, data.world, data.gov, Google Trends, Google’s BigQuery public datasets, the British government’s official data portal, Reddit, Nord Pool electricity market, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras provide the datasets suitable for practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more interesting resource is the TensorFlow Neural Network Playground that allows you to create and use neural networks visually from your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the datasets, check Duomly’s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.duomly.com/15-best-machine-learning-datasets-for-free/&quot;&gt;15 Best Machine Learning Datasets For Free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_bg_layout_dark et_pb_text_align_left&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_pb_text_inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning machine learning is a challenging and interesting task. It requires knowledge in many areas. Once you master it, it offers huge possibilities to apply it and finds interesting and well-paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents some resources for learning data science and machine learning, get data to practice with, as well as a few general advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more fascinating books, courses, tutorials, blog posts, videos, and so on. Maybe more than one could read or watch during an average human lifetime. There are many average or low-quality stuff, as well. There are some new resources appearing every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is just at its beginning. It grows and develops. If you want to be involved with it, you should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Why All of Our Games Look Like Crap</title>
<link>https://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2019/08/why-all-of-our-games-look-like-crap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2019/08/why-all-of-our-games-look-like-crap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tV0QOWTjVOM/XV23pI64tQI/AAAAAAAABJ0/cTClB88yTnEMMnhu1aB-8H_pmVJx140qACLcBGAs/s1600/QW%2BSS.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;900&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tV0QOWTjVOM/XV23pI64tQI/AAAAAAAABJ0/cTClB88yTnEMMnhu1aB-8H_pmVJx140qACLcBGAs/s400/QW%2BSS.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;We spent years working on this game. We're betting our family's future on it. So. Why does it look so bad?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
We've been writing indie games for a living for 25 years. My wife and I run a humble little mom-and-pop business. We make retro low-budget role-playing games that have great stories and design and are a lot of fun.&lt;p&gt;Also, they look like crap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/exile/winexile.html&quot;&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt; I released, in January of 1995, looked like crap. It achieved financial success (among the blind, apparently), which funded many more games that looked like crap, enabling me to build a solid reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this reputation, we had a successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/619141553/queens-wish-the-conqueror&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/queenswish/index.html&quot;&gt;Queen's Wish: The Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, an exciting upcoming RPG that will look like crap. We hope it will be a gateway to us making games that look like crap for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no complaints. We are in the middle of a long, successful career, and everything is rosy. However, sometimes I like to write about the indie game business and help people understand how it works and give advice to younger developers. This article is about why our games look the way they do, whether you like them or not (probably not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I want to advocate for the right of indie developers to be weird. If an indie dev has a wild, creative idea and is scared of trying it and thinks, &quot;I might as well do it, at least I'm not being as crazy as Jeff Vogel,&quot; I've done my job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are interested in why we write games that look like crap and will ALWAYS look like crap, read on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cTiUIc6iPW8/XV25Ljk7YNI/AAAAAAAABKE/egQC2tH8YvEsDqOEDPbaXmUN0-r7hPXbQCLcBGAs/s1600/Ultima%2BV%2BSS.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;400&quot; data-original-width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cTiUIc6iPW8/XV25Ljk7YNI/AAAAAAAABKE/egQC2tH8YvEsDqOEDPbaXmUN0-r7hPXbQCLcBGAs/s400/Ultima%2BV%2BSS.gif&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;This is what I grew up playing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_V:_Warriors_of_Destiny&quot;&gt;A true classic.&lt;/a&gt; This is what looks normal to me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, Let's Just Get One Thing Clear ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think my games look good, and they contain a lot of really good art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the art in Queen's Wish was made by extremely talented freelancers doing really solid work to my specifications. I feel very lucky to be working with them. If you think my games look bad, any blame for that rests with me entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, again, I think Queen’s Wish looks really nice and comfy. Maybe it's a generational thing. People who grew up with Nintendo and Sega really like pixel art. I grew up with Atari and Intellivision, and I am very used to having art that leaves a lot to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My art is the sort of game art I grew up with, just with more modern color and detail, designed to give the feel of a tabletop Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game. That is my goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when I say my games look like crap, I am maybe being a little clickbaity. Video games are art, art is hugely subjective, and there are lots of people who genuinely like how my games look. I certainly do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is an explanation for those who disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5l2GD5AQl5M/XV25k_cZ73I/AAAAAAAABKY/gLohfyjFQvchoKRpl_OV8ICL6jv2Ki1GQCLcBGAs/s1600/Exile%2BSS.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;819&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1028&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5l2GD5AQl5M/XV25k_cZ73I/AAAAAAAABKY/gLohfyjFQvchoKRpl_OV8ICL6jv2Ki1GQCLcBGAs/s400/Exile%2BSS.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Exile: Escape From the Pit, the first game we ever released. Queen's Wish is meant to evoke this old style, which, yes, I like.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Brought This Post On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have criticized the art in our games for decades. I have had indie developers, normally a mild and supportive lot, make fun of my games TO MY FACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a pretty thick skin about it. Still, when we announced Queen's Wish: The Conqueror, I got this message on Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff, I really like what you do and Geneforge 2 is one of my favorite games ever, but why not get a better artist? It's not even about technically impressive art, just about something that is pleasant to look at and doesn't alienate people. So many of my friends have told me they'd love to try your games but just can't get over the sloppy and cheap art style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Ouch.&lt;p&gt;What fascinates me here is that the guy seems to think he is telling me news. Like, I'm smart enough to keep a software company running for 25 years, but I am unable to notice qualities in my games that are instantly obvious to Joe Q. Rando. Apparently, my games are so ugly that looking directly at them without protective gear will turn you into this guy ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MfM7PUxwfwM/XV23N53L6-I/AAAAAAAABJs/HsQH0jF1n0Y6waJ5LrSwCcRY1I0CkP3egCLcBGAs/s1600/nazi.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;298&quot; data-original-width=&quot;364&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MfM7PUxwfwM/XV23N53L6-I/AAAAAAAABJs/HsQH0jF1n0Y6waJ5LrSwCcRY1I0CkP3egCLcBGAs/s320/nazi.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;So yeah, this message bummed me out a bit, but it shouldn't have. I have seen COUNTLESS variants of this criticism over the last 25 years. At least he didn't threaten my life or call me slurs or wish horrible fates on my children (which happens).&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Wrong With Our Art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think my art is fine and don't understand what the problem is, bless you. I'll tell you what some think is wrong, as best I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Queen's Wish has a very retro square-tile top-down view, reminiscent of old Ultima games, old Pokemon games, Spiderweb's first games, tabletop D&amp;amp;D, that sort of thing. For some, that old style is really unfamiliar and/or alienating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Queen's Wish uses art made by a lot of different artists. That means that the style is not quite consistent. We've done our best to make it blend well, but it's a little off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. All the characters only look in diagonal directions. I made this choice because I once thought all the art would be hand-drawn, and I desperately needed to reduce the number of icons I needed. This was a mistake, and I'll probably try to fix it in Queen's Wish 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. It's not in 3-D. Some people will only ever be happy with 3-D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are lots of other problems. These are just the most common complaints. All these problems can be fixed. All they need is money. Lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QlCGk55dP3Y/XV253TrOPmI/AAAAAAAABKg/5PgqDIWkA0Ug1EyrUptb0yRcqn_-qzxrQCLcBGAs/s1600/sulfraslair1920x1080.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;900&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QlCGk55dP3Y/XV253TrOPmI/AAAAAAAABKg/5PgqDIWkA0Ug1EyrUptb0yRcqn_-qzxrQCLcBGAs/s400/sulfraslair1920x1080.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Our previous game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/avernum/avernum3/index.html&quot;&gt;Avernum 3: Ruined World&lt;/a&gt;. Why didn't I just write another game that looks like this? Because I didn't want to. Nyeah!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So. Why Do My Games Look Like Crap?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more accurately, why do my games look the way they do, when other more fancy, more expensive art styles are available? Style that would, I freely admit, increase my sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the reasons I don't change. If you want to make a living in the games business, or run ANY business, these ideas might be useful to you. This isn't just me whining. There are a lot of key basic principles here, and ignoring them is very dangerous for a small entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. I Can Never Be Good Enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember we're a tiny company, like most indie developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to change how I write games and run my business. Fine. Maybe I should. the first thing I have to ask is: What is my goal? It's to convert non-customers into customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are players out there who look at my games and say, &quot;I don't want to play a game that looks like that.&quot; That is totally their right. But suppose I want to win those people over. What is required?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key problem here is that, when most people say, &quot;Your art looks bad,&quot; what they mean is, &quot;I want art that is good.&quot; They mean, &quot;I want AAA-quality art.&quot; And I can't make that. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had games where I worked very hard to improve the graphics, spending a lot of time and money, and they really did look better! But when I released those games, the vast majority of people who had said, &quot;Your games look bad.&quot; STILL said, &quot;Your games look bad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games like Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin look infinitely better than my work. Those games also have huge teams, paid for by big budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let's be clear. If this is what you want, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! Hey, I like good graphics too. If you want really good graphics, my games will never be for you. I can't afford you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing story-heavy RPGs like mine is still a total niche business. AAA gaming has moved away from what I write very fast. Yes, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was a big hit, but Pillars of Eternity 2 very much was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will never run a big game company. I have to stay small, both because of business realities and because of what my wife and I want from our lives. So our games will never be fancy. They will always be humble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON:&lt;/strong&gt; Before trying for a goal, make sure that goal is possible to reach. It might not be. Know your limits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_rQjUxtKU/XV25IAMb7fI/AAAAAAAABKI/8zDGNGiNoWMQiCoMNRPCAFMrBdGyYDQSACEwYBhgL/s1600/1521633725-1536250531.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;429&quot; data-original-width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_rQjUxtKU/XV25IAMb7fI/AAAAAAAABKI/8zDGNGiNoWMQiCoMNRPCAFMrBdGyYDQSACEwYBhgL/s400/1521633725-1536250531.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Nethergate, released in 1997. A huge improvement over Exile. Before I released it, everyone said my games look bad. After I released it, everyone said my games look bad.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;BUT ... Just because we can't shoot for the moon doesn't mean that we can't make some improvements! Hire a full-time artist. Hire another programmer who knows Unity. Why not do that?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. We Want To Run a Profitable Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you want to run a small business, managing your budget is vitally important. Right now, our games only need to earn enough to support one family. When you have a solid product and a decent reputation, that is a very realistic goal. We've been doing it for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to hire a second employee. That will double the budget for our game. That means we have to double our sales to make up for it. When you are in business, especially one as competitive as video games, doubling sales is HARD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would a second or third employee increase sales? Absolutely. Would it do so enough to justify the expense? Far more dubious. And bear in mind I need to come up with the money to hire those employees in the first place. That probably means a bank loan. Even if I get that loan, if the extra sales from the new employees isn't enough to pay the loan, that means the whole business can die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can increasing headcount and making better games be a good idea? Of course! Businesses do it all the time! It's how great games are made. It is also a good way to lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already have a long-term profitable business, and that is not unrelated to my risk-averse personality. I don't want to blow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON:&lt;/strong&gt; When you spend more money, you need to increase sales to match those expenses. Make sure you have a good chance of doing this, and make sure you can stomach the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JcBvpaD120s/XV26c27xIYI/AAAAAAAABKs/UzYBXTru0G4BoxV2AuAsRYHOCbvUqDPWQCLcBGAs/s1600/darkest-dungeon-combat.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;467&quot; data-original-width=&quot;830&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JcBvpaD120s/XV26c27xIYI/AAAAAAAABKs/UzYBXTru0G4BoxV2AuAsRYHOCbvUqDPWQCLcBGAs/s400/darkest-dungeon-combat.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Darkest Dungeon has really good art that a small team can afford to do. However, the style is really distinctive. Finding artists to reproduce this exact look is hard.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;BUT ... Small companies make great-looking games all the time. The key is to get an artist to make a cool, distinctive art style (like hand-drawn or pixel art). My games have fairly standard, neutral icon art. Why not have more style?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. We Need To Maintain a Consistent Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very subtle but important point, and it's one that people don't think about enough when analyzing or planning indie games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to make a game like Darkest Dungeon, that doesn't actually have a huge amount of art, but it has a really cool, distinctive style. A small developer could afford to write a game like Darkest Dungeon. I have to get a freelancer who will develop an individual art style for a reasonable price. (Because I can’t afford a full-time employee, see above.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a key problem with freelancers: They have free will. They will very rarely be able to work for you for a long time. They get better jobs, or they quit making art, or they make art but for someone else, or they just flake out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I get half a game-worth of really neat, funky art, and then my freelancer gets a real job for big bucks. I then have to find a new artist who can match the style of that art and make a lot of it, which is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then suppose I write a sequel, and I want to reuse that art and need more art made in that style. Then it is even more likely that my freelancer (and any replacements) will have moved on, and then I either have to throw everything away and get it redone (expensive in time and money) or find a new artist who will try to match that art's style and probably not do a great job at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't stress this enough: Finding talented, reliable, reasonably priced freelancers is HARD. Cherish them when you find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why all of my games have a more generic fantasy style. I have to work with a lot of different artists. It's the nature of the business. Thus I have to write games in a way that the artists can be replaced. The generic style this requires is not ideal, but it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON:&lt;/strong&gt; Always be aware of when you are relying on other people. Always be prepared to replace anyone. People move on. Life happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sUGFGLSg7Ek/XV26tpipJxI/AAAAAAAABK0/_98bEG0RSJEuXA0OsuvxrgOZZnTsthGkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Baba%2BSS.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;675&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sUGFGLSg7Ek/XV26tpipJxI/AAAAAAAABK0/_98bEG0RSJEuXA0OsuvxrgOZZnTsthGkgCLcBGAs/s400/Baba%2BSS.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;This is a really good, critically acclaimed, successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://hempuli.com/baba/&quot;&gt;indie game&lt;/a&gt;. If a game that looks like this can be a hit, maybe there can be room for me?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;But you did games with a more 3-D look and I like those better. Your games looked kind of fine. Why didn't you stay with that?&quot;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You Gotta' Follow Your Muse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game makers are artists. Artists are dependent on their inspirations. Sometimes your brain just wants to make a certain thing. If you aren't going to do what you want and believe in, why are you writing indie games?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been writing games with that angled isometric look for twenty years. Twenty! I just wanted to write something that looks different. I have to change things sometimes to stay interested and keep from burning out. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON:&lt;/strong&gt; Not every artist can make every sort of art. Van Gogh couldn't paint a Renoir painting. If something inspires you, consider following that. If you're writing things you don't want to write, why not just get a real job? You'll get a regular paycheck and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UV3gB-PJ8YQ/XV27AOulclI/AAAAAAAABK8/stl90E0ry3gYOaUaR_akb5ir3gQk1Z3bQCLcBGAs/s1600/54793-adventure-atari-2600-screenshot-get-the-key-to-unlock-the-castle.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;384&quot; data-original-width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UV3gB-PJ8YQ/XV27AOulclI/AAAAAAAABK8/stl90E0ry3gYOaUaR_akb5ir3gQk1Z3bQCLcBGAs/s400/54793-adventure-atari-2600-screenshot-get-the-key-to-unlock-the-castle.gif&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Atari Adventure, one of my all-time favorite games. A true classic. I STILL love this game. If you don't like it, maybe the problem is you.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;BUT ... Surely you can do SOMETHING? Surely there is some hope! Can nothing be improved?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Again, Some People Like Our Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, we've sold MANY copies of our games. We have fans. Our games have a scruffy, eccentric handmade look. Our indie games look, well, indie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like how our games look, more or less, and I get a vote too. Maybe I'm a big weirdo, but weirdos spend money too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, honestly, isn't one of the foundational ideas of indie games that there is room for all sorts of creative expression? That having more dollars doesn't give you a better claim on The Truth? That you don't have to be a billion dollar company to be good, to be right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you think my games look bad, don't play them. Believe me, I understand. But I got into this business to make my weird toys in my weird way. If I ever can't convince people to buy them, I'll quit and sell shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are doing something that is working, keep doing it. If you are comfortable with your success, don't let anyone psych you out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2L9h2DNCU2Q/XV28DffpIuI/AAAAAAAABLQ/FsA7C8sfW2UZSlRsqllcWQ6CWJ-YVjFFQCLcBGAs/s1600/20e.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;383&quot; data-original-width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2L9h2DNCU2Q/XV28DffpIuI/AAAAAAAABLQ/FsA7C8sfW2UZSlRsqllcWQ6CWJ-YVjFFQCLcBGAs/s400/20e.gif&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;People have been hating on my art for 25 years. I am very lucky, and I hope they'll be doing it for 25 more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Run Our Own Businesses To Have Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, one of the most saddening things about our current economy is that the number of small businesses and self-employed entrepreneurs has been dropping &lt;a href=&quot;https://sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/&quot;&gt;for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at Spiderweb love the freedom of being our own bosses, and we hope others get to enjoy it too. It's a scary way to live, but it has its rewards. We get to be weird. We get to make our own thing, and we OWN it. That is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, anonymous Reddit person, that is why we don't have art that is &quot;pleasant to look at and doesn't alienate people&quot;. This was a lot of words, but it's actually a pretty big question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've stuck with me this far, thank you, and I hope, in your life, you get to create things that make you content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;###&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am writing these blog posts to get attention to our newest game, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/queenswish/index.html&quot;&gt;Queen's Wish: The Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;.

<og:title>Why All Of Our Games Look Like Crap</og:title>
<og:description>We spent years working on this game. We're betting our family's future on it. So. Why does it look so bad? We've been writing indie game...</og:description>

<title>Using TypeScript with React</title>
<link>https://simonknott.de/articles/Using-TypeScript-with-React.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://simonknott.de/articles/Using-TypeScript-with-React.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is based on a talk I gave at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/React-JS-React-Native-Bonn-Meetup/events/262193621/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;React JS &amp;amp; React Native Bonn Meetup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It aims to answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s TypeScript?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I use it with React?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should I (not) use it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this was my first public talk ever that was not at school, I’m relieved it went well - thanks to the people who attended the talk! 😁 Preparing and giving presentations is a thing I really enjoy, so I guess I’ll try to do it more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://typescriptlang.org&quot;&gt;typescriptlang.org&lt;/a&gt;, TypeScript (TS in short) is described by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. ~ typescriptlang.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? The first thing that’s obvious from this statement is that TypeScript is a &lt;em&gt;typed&lt;/em&gt; language that’s somehow related to JavaScript. This is the main difference to JavaScript, which is a dynamically-typed language. Secondly, TypeScript can be compiled to plain JavaScript, which can then be executed on targets like the Browser or Node.js. Finally, being a &lt;em&gt;superset&lt;/em&gt; of JavaScript means that TypeScript will only add its features on top of JS while still maintaining strict compatibility with the underlying JS specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at an example. Since TS is a superset of JS, the following is valid code of both languages:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:thirty-one&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonknott.de/articles/Using-TypeScript-with-React.html#fn:thirty-one&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;favNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we already learned, the special thing about TypeScript is its types. Adding types to the above code yields the following, which is now valid TypeScript, but not valid JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;favNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding these annotations, the TypeScript compiler can check your code to find any bugs in it. For example, it could find mismatched parameter types or the usage of variables outside of the current scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiling TypeScript is done using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; CLI, which will type-check the code and - if all checks were succesful - will emit the code in plain JavaScript. The emitted code will look a lot like your source code, just without type annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript also has support for basic type-inference, which can simplify code by allowing you to omit the return type of functions and in most cases also the type of variable assignments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;favNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It can be hard to spot the difference: There’s no return type in line 1 and no variable type in line 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the kind of types that are available in TS. There are the primitive &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Symbol&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BigInt&lt;/code&gt; types (yes, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BigInt&lt;/code&gt; seems to be a primitive type in modern JS 😅); there’s the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; type to denote that a function does not return anything; there’s the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; type and there is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Array&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type which is more commonly denoted as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number[]&lt;/code&gt;. Also, there are environment-specific types like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ReactElement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTMLInputElement&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Express.App&lt;/code&gt; which will not be available in all projects, but are specific to your deploy targets and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about TS is that you can define your own types. Let’s have a look at some ways how you can use that to model your domain. There is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; keyword which you can use to declare the shape of your objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can declare &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enums&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;INACTIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;INVITED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript even supports inheritance in its type definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;FunkyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;isDancing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also more advanced types like the union type, which can be used to replace Enumerations in a more JavaScript-like way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;active&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;inactive&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;invited&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;correctState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;active&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ✅&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;incorrectState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;loggedin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ❌ TypeError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When type-checking, TypeScript does not check any prototype chains nor other means of inheritance, it only checks the type signatures of properties and functions your objects feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Bugs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Bunny&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;too old&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TypeError: expected `number` but got `string`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to keep from you that you obviously can also use classes in TypeScript, but &lt;em&gt;beware&lt;/em&gt;: Later on in this post, I will explain why I don’t think you should use them. Anyway, here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JavaLover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getOpinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;!!JAVA!1!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve seen some basic TypeScript code and have a general understanding of what it does, let’s find out how to use it with React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Babel 7 comes with built-in support for TypeScript, integrating it into your build is really simple. I still recommend you to consult the documentation of your build tool. Most of them include a well-written How-To-Guide concerning TypeScript setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you set up your build, you can start to use TypeScript in your components. Here’s a simple React-Native component that receives a TodoItem and a callback in its props and displays a single Todo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;react&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CheckBox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;react-native&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TodoItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;isCompleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TodoItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;onComplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TodoListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TodoListItemProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onComplete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CheckBox&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isChecked=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isCompleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onClick=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onComplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since React is plain JavaScript at heart, it can be typed just like plain JavaScript. You just define the schema of your component’s props using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; declaration (see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interface TodoListItemProps&lt;/code&gt;) and annotate the type of the component’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; param using the just-defined &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TodoListItemProps&lt;/code&gt; type. You don’t need to specify the return type (it’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSX.Element&lt;/code&gt;), since it can be inferred from the type of the component’s return expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though JSX is not part of the JavaScript spec, TypeScript is able to type-check JSX. This allows it to validate the props you pass into components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also make use of TypeScript in conjunction with React’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-tsx highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;react&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TimerState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TimerState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TimerState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Count: &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When typing a class, you pass your type parameter into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt; you’re “extending”. The props of the component, which are empty in the example above (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, the empty object), come first. The second generic type parameter is your component’s state, which simply contains a numeric count in this case. You can also see that this uses an instance field called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timerId&lt;/code&gt;, which is initialized as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. This is why its type is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number | undefined&lt;/code&gt;, which means “either &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you see, using TypeScript with React is very straight-forward and requires no ceremony. It’s basically a more powerful replacement for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prop-types&lt;/code&gt;, since it supports more advanced types and can type normal JS code, too. Also, TypeScript is validated at compile-time while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prop-types&lt;/code&gt; does its validations during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around with some code yourself, you can have a look at the example that I used in my live demo. It is located in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/code&gt;-Folder of this repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Skn0tt/react-and-typescript-talk&quot;&gt;skn0tt/react-and-typescript-talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, I assume you have a general understanding of what TypeScript is and what it can do. Let me go on by elaborating on (what I assume to be) false assumptions about TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-typescript-not&quot;&gt;What is TypeScript &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a new way to write JavaScript - all it does is extending it by the ability to annotate your types. First and foremost, TypeScript is a type-checker. There seems to be a tendency to neglect this fact, as I recently read some statements that went like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“TypeScript is great, finally our Java devs can also work on the frontend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem to make sense, this attitude can be harmful. Sure: Since there are types and classes and interfaces and all that good stuff your Java developers are used to, TypeScript can seem quite inviting to them. However, transferring your Java (or any other heavily OOP-influenced language for that matter) developers over to write TypeScript while not learning about the deep-rooted differences between Java and JavaScript can lead to big problems down the road. Remember: Whether your JavaScript code was compiled from TypeScript or not does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; change anything about its runtime behaviour. Once it is executed, there’s not type information left - it’s plain JavaScript, in all its glory and (especially) with all its painpoints. JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, is dynamically typed and has type coercion, has functional influences and many more characteristics that could not be further away from Java. You should keep that in mind when transferring your Java devs over to TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another myth is that “TypeScript will eliminate all your type errors”. While this is true for self-owned code, your (not-typescripty) dependencies may come with flawed type declarations or no type declarations at all. This is a trade-off of TypeScript which enables easy interaction with JavaScript code, but sacrifices the virtue of true typesafeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-typescript-still-help-me&quot;&gt;How can TypeScript still help me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding types to your project is a great way to document its structure. It gives you a way to notate the shape of the data you’re passing around. It’s also machine-readable, which means it can be enforced by a machine! This allows for great editor support (try VS Code, it’s great!), easier refactorings and enhanced static security checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript not only enables you to document your code’s structure, it forces you to. This can also cause you to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; - and reflect about the code you’re writing and wether you can create clearer structure, which will increas the quality of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least for me, having types in my code makes it easier to understand since I don’t need to dig around in the project to find out the shape of my data. It removes a lot of cognitive complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting TypeScript in your projects will lead to better quality code. By adding type information, it promotes structure and allows for advanced static analysis. This will make it easier to read your code and also augment your workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating TypeScript into React projects works almost frictionless - especially, if you follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide&quot;&gt;Static Typing Guide&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/piotrekwitek&quot;&gt;@piotrekwitek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any experience with TypeScript or other languages that compile to JavaScript? If yes, what did you like/dislike about it? I’d love to hear from you in the comments or over at Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skn0tt&quot;&gt;@skn0tt&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;If you decided on getting into TypeScript: Have fun! It will be a great time. Just try to always keep in mind that all the code you’re writing will be JavaScript at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;As an anthropologist who studies human fatherhood at the University of Oxford, I’ve run up against a widespread and deeply ingrained belief among fathers: that because their bodies haven’t undergone the myriad biological changes associated with pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding, they’re not as biologically and psychologically “primed” for caretaking as women are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;As a result, they feel less confident and question their abilities to parent: Will they be “good” parents? Will they bond with their babies? How will they know what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;As my own personal and professional experiences dictate, the idea that fathers are biologically “less prepared” for parenthood is unlikely to be true. Much of the role of parenting is not instinctual for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. (I remember the steep learning curve of those first days of motherhood — learning what each of my baby’s cries meant, mastering the quick diaper change and juggling the enormous amount of equipment necessary just to make it out the door.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;And while the biological changes fathers undergo are not as well understood (nor as outwardly dramatic) as those of mothers, scientists are just beginning to find that both men &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; women undergo hormonal and brain changes that herald this key transition in a parent’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;In essence, being a dad is as biological a phenomenon as being a mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1mz92ao&quot;&gt;Testosterone seems to dip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Take testosterone, the stereotypically “male” hormone that plays important roles in male fetal development and puberty. Testosterone is largely responsible for motivating men to find partners and, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618760197&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt;, men with higher levels of testosterone tend to be more attractive to potential mates. But being a successful human father means focusing inward on the family and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639674&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;resisting the drive to seek out another partner.&lt;/a&gt; So, experts believe, men have evolved for some of that testosterone to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;In a pioneering &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51631751_Longitudinal_Evidence_that_Fatherhood_Decreases_Testosterone_in_Human_Males&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;five-year study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2011, for instance, Dr. Lee Gettler, Ph.D., an American anthropologist, followed a group of 624 single, childless men in the Philippines from age 21 to 26. Dr. Gettler found that while all men in the study experienced normal, age-related dips in testosterone, the 465 men who became dads during that five-year period experienced a more significant drop — an average 34 percent (when measured at night) — than those who remained single or married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Globally, study after study — including my own unpublished findings in the United Kingdom — have found similar results, noting that this reduction in testosterone can happen just before and just after the birth of a man’s first child. And while it isn’t clear exactly what prompts this drop, Dr. Gettler said that his own preliminary results suggest that the more dramatic the drop, the bigger effect it seems to have on a man’s caregiving behavior. “We found that if brand new fathers had lower testosterone the day after their babies were born,” said Dr. Gettler, “they did more caregiving and baby-related household tasks months later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;While news of this drop in testosterone is often greeted with groans of resignation from men — choose fatherhood and choose the road to emasculation, they think — some &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404163/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;studies have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the lower a man’s testosterone, the more likely he is to release key reward and bonding hormones, namely oxytocin and dopamine, when interacting with his child. Caring for your child, therefore, produces not only a strong bond but a neurochemical reward, inducing feelings of happiness, contentment and warmth — a welcome trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1mz92ao&quot;&gt;Brains seem to change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;The brain also appears to undergo structural changes to ensure that fathers exhibit the key skills of parenting. In 2014, Dr. Pilyoung Kim, Ph.D., a developmental neuroscientist at The University of Denver, put 16 new dads into an M.R.I. machine: once between the first two to four weeks of their baby’s life, and again between 12 and 16 weeks. Dr. Kim &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144350/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; brain changes that mirrored those previously seen in new moms: Certain areas within parts of the brain linked to attachment, nurturing, empathy and the ability to interpret and react appropriately to a baby’s behavior had more gray and white matter between 12 and 16 weeks than they did between two and four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Dr. Kim believes this bulking of the brain reflects a ramping up of the skills associated with parenting — such as nurturing and understanding your baby’s needs — and the inevitably steep learning curve that both new moms and new dads have to surmount. In particular, because men do not experience the hormonal surges that accompany pregnancy and childbirth, “learning how to emotionally bond with their own infants may particularly be an important part of becoming a father,” Dr. Kim suggested. “The anatomical changes in the brain may support fathers’ gradual learning experience over many months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;But while both new mothers and new fathers show activation in the brain regions linked with empathy and understanding their child’s emotional state and behavioral intentions, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shir_Atzil/publication/230575695_Synchrony_and_Specificity_in_the_Maternal_and_the_Paternal_Brain_Relations_to_Oxytocin_and_Vasopressin/links/5ab73802a6fdcc46d3b6c0c3/Synchrony-and-Specificity-in-the-Maternal-and-the-Paternal-Brain-Relations-to-Oxytocin-and-Vasopressin.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a 2012 study&lt;/a&gt; by neuroscientists at Bar-Ilan University in Israel suggested that the parts of the brain that light up the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; are startlingly different for each parent. For moms, regions closer to the core of the brain — which enable them to care, nurture and detect risk — were most active. But for dads, the parts that shone most brightly were located on the outer surface of the brain, where higher, more conscious cognitive functions sit, such as thought, goal orientation, planning and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Dr. Shir Atzil, Ph.D., a psychologist at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and lead author of the study, believes — along with Dr. Kim — that dads’ brains have adapted in similar but different ways to ensure that they can bond with and care for their babies, despite not having given birth to them. Meaning both mothers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fathers are primed to “demonstrate similar levels of motivation and attunement to the infant,” said Dr. Atzil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Beyond this, the differing areas of brain activation may reflect a difference in role, and different but equally strong attachments, between mothers and fathers. It is a cliché that children run to Mom for a hug when they’re hurt, while Dad is the “fun” parent. But evidence suggests that mothers and fathers get different neurochemical “rewards” after certain parenting behaviors, eliciting these differences in stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;Dr. Ruth Feldman, Ph.D., a social neuroscientist based in Israel, published &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Oxytocin_Parenting.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of 112 mothers and fathers in 2010 which found that peaks in oxytocin (and by association, dopamine) occurred for women when they nurtured their children. In contrast, the peak for men occurred when they took part in rough-and-tumble play. Because young children’s brains seem to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656367/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;mimic&lt;/a&gt; the same oxytocin levels as their parents’ — meaning they’ll get a similar blast of feel-good oxytocin when playing with Dad and when being nurtured by Mom — they’ll be more likely to engage in that behavior over and over again specifically with that parent, which is critical to their development. Rough-and-tumble play not only cements bonds between father and child, but also plays crucial roles in a child’s social development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-czibw0&quot;&gt;There are, of course, many questions still to answer in the relatively new field of the biology of fatherhood. After 10 years of study, we now need to replicate our findings on larger and more diverse groups. But if I get the chance, I tell new fathers that evolution has primed them to parent just as it has primed women. Biology has their back.&lt;/p&gt;
