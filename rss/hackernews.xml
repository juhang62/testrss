<title>Linus Torvalds&amp;#039; good taste argument for linked lists, explained</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TED interview&lt;/a&gt; (14:10) Linus Torvalds speaks about what he considers &lt;em&gt;good taste&lt;/em&gt; in coding. As an example, he presents two implementations of item removal in singly linked lists (reproduced below). In order to remove the first item from a list, one of the implementations requires a special case, the other one does not. Linus, obviously, prefers the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] I don't want you to understand why it doesn't have the if statement. But I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case, and that's &lt;em&gt;good code&lt;/em&gt;. [...] -- L. Torvalds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code snippets he presents are C-style pseudocode and are simple enough to follow. However, as Linus mentions in the comment, the snippets lack a conceptual explanation and it is not immediately evident how the more elegant solution actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two sections look at the technical approach in detail and demonstrate how and why the indirect addressing approach is so neat. The last section extends the solution from item deletion to insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic data structure for a singly linked list of integers is shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/blob/main/img/linked-list.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;linked list&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/raw/main/img/linked-list.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Singly linked list of integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers are arbitrarily chosen integer values and arrows indicate pointers. &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer of type &lt;code&gt;IntListItem*&lt;/code&gt; and each of the boxes is an instance of an &lt;code&gt;IntListItem&lt;/code&gt; struct, each with a member variable (called &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; in the code) of type &lt;code&gt;IntListItem*&lt;/code&gt; that points to the next item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C implementation of the data structure is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; IntListItem {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; value;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; IntListItem* next;
};
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; IntListItem IntListItem;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; IntList {
    IntListItem* head;
};
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; IntList IntList;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also include a (minimal) API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt; The textbook version &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;remove_cs101&lt;/span&gt;(IntList* l, IntListItem* target);
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt; A more elegant solution &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;remove_elegant&lt;/span&gt;(IntList* l, IntListItem* target);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in place, let's have a look at the implementations of &lt;code&gt;remove_cs101()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remove_elegant()&lt;/code&gt;. The code of these examples is true to the pseudocode from Linus' example and also compiles and runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The CS101 version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/blob/main/img/data-model-cs101.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;simple data model&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/raw/main/img/data-model-cs101.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;: The conceptual model for the list data structure in the CS101 algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;remove_cs101&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *target)
{
    IntListItem *cur = l-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;, *prev = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (cur != target) {
        prev = cur;
        cur = cur-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (prev) {
        prev-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; = cur-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
    } &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        l-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; = cur-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard CS101 approach makes use of two traversal pointers &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt;, marking the current and previous traversal position in the list, respectively. &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; starts at the list head &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;, and advances until the target is found. &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; starts at &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; and is subsequently updated with the previous value of &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; every time &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; advances. After the target is found, the algorithm tests if &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is non-&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. If yes, the item is not at the beginning of the list and the removal consists of re-routing the linked list around &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; is pointing to the first element in the list, in which case, removal means moving the list head forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A more elegant solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more elegant version has less code and does not require a separate branch to deal with deletion of the first element in a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;remove_elegant&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *target)
{
    IntListItem **p = &amp;amp;l-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; ((*p) != target) {
        p = &amp;amp;(*p)-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
    }
    *p = target-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code uses an indirect pointer &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; that holds the address of a pointer to a list item, starting with the address of &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;. In every iteration, that pointer is advanced to hold the address of the pointer to the next list item, i.e. the address of the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; element in the current &lt;code&gt;IntListItem&lt;/code&gt;. When the pointer to the list item &lt;code&gt;(*p)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;, we exit the search loop and remove the item from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight is that using an indirect pointer &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; has two conceptual benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It allows us to interpret the linked list in a way that makes the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; pointer an integral part the data structure. This eliminates the need for a special case to remove the first item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also allows us to evaluate the condition of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop without having to let go of the pointer that points to &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to modify the pointer that points to &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; and to get away with a single iterator as opposed to &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look each of these points in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrating the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; pointer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard model interprets the linked list as a sequence of &lt;code&gt;IntListItem&lt;/code&gt; instances. The beginning of the sequence can be accessed through a &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; pointer. This leads to the conceptual model illustrated in Figure 2 above. The &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; pointer is merely considered as a handle to access the start of the list. &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; are pointers of type &lt;code&gt;IntListItem*&lt;/code&gt; and always point to an item or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elegant implementation uses indirect addressing scheme that yields a different view on the data structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/blob/main/img/data-model-indirect.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Data model for indirect addressing&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste/raw/main/img/data-model-indirect.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;: The conceptual model for the list data structure in the more elegant approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;IntListItem**&lt;/code&gt; and holds the address of the pointer to the current list item. When we advance the pointer, we forward to the address of the pointer to the next list item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In code, this translates to &lt;code&gt;p = &amp;amp;(*p)-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt;, meaning we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(*p)&lt;/code&gt;: dereference the address to the pointer to the current list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt;: dereference that pointer again and select the field that holds the address of the next list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;: take the address of that address field (i.e. get a pointer to it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This corresponds to an interpretation of the data structure where the list is a a sequence of pointers to &lt;code&gt;IntListItem&lt;/code&gt;s (cf. Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maintaining a handle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional benefit of that particular interpretation is that it supports editing the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; pointer of the predecessor of the current item throughout the entire traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; holding the address of a pointer to a list item, the comparison in the search loop becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; ((*p) != target) {
    ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search loop will exit if &lt;code&gt;(*p)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;, and once it does, we are still able to modify &lt;code&gt;(*p)&lt;/code&gt; since we hold its address &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, despite iterating the loop until we hit &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;, we still maintain a handle (the address of the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; field or the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; pointer) that can be used to directly modify the pointer that points &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why we can modify the incoming pointer to an item to point to a different location using &lt;code&gt;*p = target-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt; and why we do not need &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; pointers to traverse the list for item removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going beyond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the idea behind &lt;code&gt;remove_elegant()&lt;/code&gt; can be applied to yield a particularly concise implementation of another function in the list API: &lt;code&gt;insert_before()&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. inserting a given item before another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inserting before existing items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's add the following declaration to the list API in &lt;code&gt;list.h&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;insert_before&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *before, IntListItem *item);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function will take a pointer to a list &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, a pointer &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; to an item in that list and a pointer to a new list item &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; that the function will insert before &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick refactor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on, we refactor the search loop into a separate function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt; IntListItem **&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;find_indirect&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *target)
{
    IntListItem **p = &amp;amp;l-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; ((*p) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (*p) != target) {
        p = &amp;amp;(*p)-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; p;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and use that function in &lt;code&gt;remove_elegant()&lt;/code&gt; like so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;remove_elegant&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *target)
{
    IntListItem **p = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;find_indirect&lt;/span&gt;(l, target);
    *p = target-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementing &lt;code&gt;insert_before()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;find_indirect()&lt;/code&gt;, it is straightforward to implement &lt;code&gt;insert_before()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-c&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;insert_before&lt;/span&gt;(IntList *l, IntListItem *before, IntListItem *item)
{
    IntListItem **p = &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;find_indirect&lt;/span&gt;(l, before);
    *p = item;
    item-&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; = before;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly beautiful outcome is that the implementation has consistent semantics for the edge cases: if &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; points to the list head, the new item will be inserted at the beginning of the list, if &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; or invalid (i.e. the item does not exist in &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;), the new item will be appended at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the more elegant solution for item deletion is a single, simple change: using an indirect &lt;code&gt;IntListItem**&lt;/code&gt; pointer to iterate over the pointers to the list items. Everything else flows from there: there is no need for a special case or branching and a single iterator is sufficient to find and remove the target item. It also turns out that the same approach provides an elegant solution for item insertion in general and for insertion &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; an existing item in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, going back to Linus' initial comment: is it good taste? Hard to say, but it's certainly a different, creative and very elegant solution to a well-known CS task.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Docker&amp;#039;s Second Death</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Docker's Second Death&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;feels-like-forever&quot;&gt;Feels Like Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;docker-shirt&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-was-inevitable&quot;&gt;It Was Inevitable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;docker-debt&quot;&gt;Docker Debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png&quot; alt=&quot;dockershim&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png&quot; alt=&quot;withoutdocker&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker run
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Grenfell Tower inquiry is uncovering a major corporate scandal</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-grenfell-tower-inquiry-is-uncovering-a-major-corporate-scandal/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;A picture of an enormous corporate scandal has emerged at the Grenfell Tower inquiry to little fanfare over the last three weeks. The mammoth inquiry has been slowly going through the evidence surrounding the build-up to the fire, which killed 72 people in June 2017. Until November, it had been examining the fitting of the deadly cladding system to the walls of the building. What the inquiry revealed was dispiriting but predictable: pennies were pinched, no one in an enormous chain of construction professionals took responsibility for key safety decisions, and the external oversight of their actions was almost non-existent. In recent weeks though, the tone of the inquiry changed, and the revelations have become considerably more startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Officially, the inquiry has been examining the testing, marketing and sale of the combustible plastic materials which were attached to the walls of the tower, and which burnt with such devastating effect on that terrible summer night three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;This chiefly means three products: the actual cladding panels (thin aluminium sheets bonded to a core of polyethylene, a plastic with similar properties to solid petrol) and two forms of combustible foam insulation which were fitted behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;These materials were made and sold by companies which are huge global players. The cladding came from the French arm of Arconic, a Pennsylvania-based giant with £5.4 billion in global turnover and roots which trace back to the historic Aluminium Company of America. The insulation was sold by Celotex, a medium-sized UK company which is part of the French multinational Saint Gobain, and Kingspan, an Irish giant with more than £3 billion in annual turnover and almost 14,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;What has emerged is evidence which suggests each of these firms were aware their products posed serious fire risks, but this was concealed from both regulators and the market so they could be sold for use on high rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Arconic realised its polyethylene-cored cladding had a horrendous reaction to fire following French tests in 2005, where it burned fiercely and obtained a basement ranking of Class E. Despite this, Arconic continued to market it as the much safer Class B (based on an earlier certification obtained using limited test data which had persuaded a respected British certification body, the British Board of Agrément, to produce the certificate apparently confirming this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;In a string of internal emails, technical members of its staff agonised about the morality of continuing to sell the ‘dangerous’ product. ‘It’s hard to make a note about this because we are not clean,’ said one in 2010. In 2015, Claude Wehrle, a senior member of Arconic’s technical team&lt;strong class=&quot;ContentPageBodyStrong-module__strong&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; wrote: ‘PE is dangerous on facades, and everything should be transferred to [a more fire-resistant panel] as a matter of urgency…This opinion is technical and anti-commercial, it seems.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, internal emails record the firm resolving to continue to sell in countries with ‘national regulations [which] are not as restrictive.’ One of these countries was the UK, which had failed to tighten rules covering cladding on high rises following two previous fires in 1999 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;The story for the insulation is a similarly miserable tale. In 2006, a UK ban on the use of combustible insulation on high rises was rescinded, as long as it had passed a large-scale fire test (a loophole the industry trade body lobbied for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;The Irish company Kingspan’s insulation passed one of these tests, which took place on a fake wall made with non-combustible cement. This test pass permitted its use on tall buildings, but only in an exact replica of the system tested. Despite this, the firm marketed its insulation as ‘suitable for use on high-rise buildings’. An unforgivably naive market of architects and contractors then began merrily specifying it for a wide range of uses well beyond its original test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Behind the scenes, the picture was even worse. After the test was passed in 2005, Kingspan altered the chemical composition of the insulation so that it was no longer the same product, according to one former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;When retested in 2007 as part of a different system it failed combustion tests dramatically. Kingspan has argued this was not a consequence of its product, but the firm's own internal report warned the new insulation had performed ‘very differently’ — burning on its own and continuing after the test fire was put out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;But the market was not told of these findings, nor that the product had changed. In fact, when the country’s largest private building control firm, the National House Building Council (NHBC) threatened to reject the product due to fears over its combustibility in the mid 2010s, Kingspan called in the lawyers and threatened it with defamation. The NHBC backed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;When a firm of facade engineers also raised questions about its suitability for a project, internal emails show Kingspan's technical manager Philip Heath (who remains employed by the firm) saying Kingspan would ‘sue the arse of them [sic]’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Celotex, a smaller firm, was envious of Kingspan’s monopoly of the high-rise market and sought to catch up in the early 2010s. By May 2014, its insulation had also passed a test, also using a non-combustible cladding panel, and it too began to market its product as safe for use on high rises. But the test was not as it seemed: fire resisting boards were used around the temperature monitors that record the pass or fail, distorting the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;The report of the test from the independent Building Research Establishment (a national building science facility dating back to world war one, but privatised in 1997) made no reference to these boards. The evidence from Celotex witnesses so far suggests the BRE staff member who wrote the report may have known about the boards, which were visible in one photograph that Celotex sought to remove, but did not mention them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Jon Roper, the 22-year-old graduate who was in charge of Celotex's effort to break into the market for tall buildings, told the inquiry of his regret that he acted so dishonestly, but said he had no one to turn to, with the firm’s senior management united behind this course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;He was able to secure a certificate from another independent body, the Local Authority Building Control (LABC) which said the insulation was suitable for use on high rises. The LABC appears to have written its certificate simply by copy and pasting an email written by Celotex's Jon Roper, even including the same typo on the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;Celotex then provided this certificate to the team that refurbished Grenfell — a major target for the sales team, as one of the first high-rise projects it would ‘win’ for its product. Celotex even inquired about using the tower as a case study for the suitability of its product for high rises. So it has turned out, although not in the way the company hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;The three firms involved in the Grenfell cladding have all denied responsibility for the disaster: Celotex emphasises that it had no design responsibility, and that compliance was a matter for the professionals who refurbished the tower. It said it repeated the allegedly distorted test without discrepancy in 2018. Kingspan says it did not pursue the Grenfell Tower job, knew nothing of the specific design and has now passed numerous tests with K15 insulation which supported its historic marketing claims, as well as its occasional failures. Arconic says that its cladding should not have been used on the tower in the way it was and has pointed to other critical issues with the installation, such as the use of insulation and inadequate fire barriers. But there are 72 grieving families who will want further answers from all those involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;This crisis has also now spread far beyond one tower in west London. The country currently has an enormous problem after dangerous cladding and insulation materials have been installed on tall buildings across the country. Thousands of people are trapped in their homes, unable to sell and facing crippling bills for repairs. More fires and more deaths are by no means impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--block ContentPageBodyParagraph-module__paragraph--size-medium--spacing-normal&quot;&gt;The picture the inquiry is painting is not yet complete. But it is already starting to look like one of the great corporate scandals of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I Collected a Debt from an Unscrupulous Merchant</title>
<link>https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I learned a handy technique for resolving disputes with uncooperative businesses. It’s simple to understand and easy to implement. You don’t need lawyers or a prominent social media presence. All it requires is for you to behave like an organized professional. This technique recently resolved a problem so effectively that I had to share the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation began with a merchant telling me in no uncertain terms that they refused to pay the money they owed me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/not-paying.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 684px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/not-paying_hu83761fc414b301fc0f104479584cfd49_39725_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/not-paying_hu83761fc414b301fc0f104479584cfd49_39725_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/not-paying.png 682w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/not-paying.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kimchi host utilization dashboard&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two email exchanges later, we landed here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/seems-fair.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 665px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/seems-fair_hu6aeb1217eec6d77bee9b96a407dd181e_32465_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/seems-fair_hu6aeb1217eec6d77bee9b96a407dd181e_32465_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/seems-fair.png 663w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/seems-fair.png&quot; alt=&quot;Herscu responds: 'No worries Michael. $88 seems fair to me.'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/paypal-receipt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 400px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/paypal-receipt_hu8d21516f8b9ea56ce55c7462b7bae364_58220_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/paypal-receipt_hu8d21516f8b9ea56ce55c7462b7bae364_58220_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/paypal-receipt.png 693w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/paypal-receipt.png&quot; alt=&quot;PayPal receipt showing $88.00 payment&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explains the dispute and how The Organized Professional Method solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;handling-bad-behavior-with-the-organized-professional-method&quot;&gt;Handling bad behavior with The Organized Professional Method &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#handling-bad-behavior-with-the-organized-professional-method&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Patrick McKenzie wrote a blog post called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2017/09/09/identity-theft-credit-reports/&quot;&gt;“Identity Theft, Credit Reports, and You.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; It’s ostensibly about disputing information on your credit report, but the article is more generalizable than Patrick perhaps intended. It was an illuminating read for me in demonstrating how much power you can wield by thinking strategically about an organization’s incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Patrick’s article, he explains that banks reward their customer service agents for getting customers off the phone as quickly as possible. They reward their compliance team for minimizing the bank’s number of regulatory incidents per year. Therefore, Patrick taught his readers how to navigate from a bank’s customer service department to their legal department. From there, the customer presents themselves as knowledgeable enough of their rights that the compliance team should rightly fear a regulatory incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy applies to businesses more generally. If a company mistreats you, usually someone at the organization has the power to correct it. The potential problem solver follows self-serving incentives, as anyone does. If you can identify those incentives and demonstrate an ability to affect them, then the person is likely to take your problem seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway for me was Patrick’s recommendations on the tone to maintain throughout the dispute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…you want to communicate with the bank in a manner which suggests that you’re an organized professional who is capable of escalating the matter if the bank does not handle it themselves. You do not yell […] You do not bluster […] You instead present as if you’re collecting a paper trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick’s recommendation resonated with me because I generally don’t see value in yelling at people, but I also don’t want to take shady business practices lying down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I’ve run a site called &lt;a href=&quot;https://isitketo.org&quot;&gt;Is It Keto&lt;/a&gt; that helps beginners navigate the keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 500px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot_hu3dc9bd5f2cf9adde1e1a08cce623515f_616990_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot_hu3dc9bd5f2cf9adde1e1a08cce623515f_616990_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot_hu3dc9bd5f2cf9adde1e1a08cce623515f_616990_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot_hu3dc9bd5f2cf9adde1e1a08cce623515f_616990_1200x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 1200w, /collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot.png 1319w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/isitketo-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Beyond Burger page on Is It Keto&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://isitketo.org&quot;&gt;Is It Keto&lt;/a&gt; is a site I created in 2018 to help beginners learn about the keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site has grown steadily over time, to the point where it now has over 100,000 pageviews per month. Those numbers are high enough to attract direct partnerships with other keto companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I joined the affiliate program for a company called Kiss My Keto. They sell keto-friendly bread and a few other keto foods. The affiliate deal meant that I’d advertise their products on Is It Keto. If any Is It Keto readers clicked a Kiss My Keto link and made a purchase, Kiss My Keto would give me a 20% commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s affiliate program sounded like a good deal, but I would later come to realize it was not what it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-my-customers-just-hate-spending-money&quot;&gt;Do my customers just hate spending money? &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#do-my-customers-just-hate-spending-money&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to see my earnings skyrocket, I checked my affiliate stats the day after I began advertising Kiss My Keto. Seven visitors had clicked links to Kiss My Keto, but I still had zero “conversions,” meaning that none of the visitors I referred had purchased anything. Okay, fine. Maybe prices were higher than they expected, or none of those seven felt like buying anything that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, it was the same thing. 26 users had visited, but none of them purchased anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/zero-sales.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 691px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/zero-sales_hubf5a3b1af1b58947e51cfda59d8e34f3_22734_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/zero-sales_hubf5a3b1af1b58947e51cfda59d8e34f3_22734_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/zero-sales.png 689w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/zero-sales.png&quot; alt=&quot;Affiliate stats showing 95 referrals and zero sales&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s stats claimed that I had sent them 95 visitors, all of whom supposedly left without making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the one month mark, I became suspicious. 95 readers from Is It Keto had visited Kiss My Keto, and the affiliate stats still claimed I had earned zero commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, I had a similar affiliate deal with Amazon, and 17% of Is It Keto readers made a purchase after clicking an Amazon link in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-20-commission-but-only-when-we-feel-like-it&quot;&gt;A 20% commission, but only when we feel like it &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#a-20-commission-but-only-when-we-feel-like-it&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baffled by these stats, I reached out to Nini Perez, Kiss My Keto’s affiliate manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;notice notice-info&quot; readability=&quot;8.3453237410072&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve edited these emails for brevity, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/full-emails/&quot;&gt;unabridged email thread&lt;/a&gt; is available for anyone who wants to see the full discussion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, she told me that maybe my customers just click the links out of curiosity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does happen. Sometimes, customers are curious and go to the site but leave without purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said something confusing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times, they try to purchase an item not qualified for a discount (subscribe &amp;amp; save, bundles or bread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not qualified for a discount? Why should that matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few back and forths, I finally got a straight answer that explained my missing commissions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/exceptions.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 722px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/exceptions_hu5b8710b33aba5f5aa7eb03b829ade5cb_44910_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/exceptions_hu5b8710b33aba5f5aa7eb03b829ade5cb_44910_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/exceptions.png 720w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/exceptions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nini reports that Kiss My Keto pays no commission on sales of bread or during sitewide discounts&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s affiliate manager reveals that they exclude certain purchases from commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a shocking revelation for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Kiss My Keto’s published policies say explicitly that their commissions apply to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; products and make no mention of exceptions. Or at least they did at the time. They removed that page sometime in the last month, but I &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/iyoxj&quot;&gt;archived a copy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/20pct-on-all.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 650px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/20pct-on-all_hu8c05a8b2b74a94cb79a2c570f5950a43_81482_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/20pct-on-all_hu8c05a8b2b74a94cb79a2c570f5950a43_81482_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/20pct-on-all_hu8c05a8b2b74a94cb79a2c570f5950a43_81482_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /collect-debt/20pct-on-all.png 1036w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/20pct-on-all.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kiss My Keto's published guidelines say they pay 20% commission on all products&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s published rates claimed a 20% commission on all products with no mention of exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, bread is Kiss My Keto’s flagship product. If you visit their website, they showcase bread so prominently that you’d think they’re a bread store. A hidden exception for bread would be like if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zappos.com&quot;&gt;Zappos&lt;/a&gt; advertised a commission on all their products and then later said, “Oh, but we didn’t mean &lt;em&gt;shoes&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-homepage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/kmk-homepage_hu2663f63871d288a4f46f8f7fbd20e778_943244_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/kmk-homepage_hu2663f63871d288a4f46f8f7fbd20e778_943244_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/kmk-homepage_hu2663f63871d288a4f46f8f7fbd20e778_943244_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /collect-debt/kmk-homepage_hu2663f63871d288a4f46f8f7fbd20e778_943244_1200x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 1200w, /collect-debt/kmk-homepage.png 1423w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nini reports that Kiss My Keto pays no commission on sales of bread or during sitewide discounts&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s homepage features bread prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not even getting into the “sale event” part of Nini’s email. Days earlier, Kiss My Keto sent their affiliates an email encouraging them to “boost [their] earnings” by sharing Kiss My Keto’s sitewide 4th of July discount codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 500px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes_hu72a2e1c2f6f28695cb5865c676ad664f_44017_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes_hu72a2e1c2f6f28695cb5865c676ad664f_44017_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes.png 639w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kiss My Keto encourages affiliates to share sitewide discount codes&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto encouraged affiliates to share coupon codes but later told me that this disqualified them from earning commissions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Nini, Kiss My Keto withheld commissions on any transaction that used that coupon, even if the customer purchased through an affiliate link. Even outside of special sales, when you visit Kiss My Keto, their site bombards you with offers for different discounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers_hu50b00727eb1a31be24ac8c54eab56c54_196597_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers_hu50b00727eb1a31be24ac8c54eab56c54_196597_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers_hu50b00727eb1a31be24ac8c54eab56c54_196597_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers_hu50b00727eb1a31be24ac8c54eab56c54_196597_1200x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 1200w, /collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers.png 1440w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-discount-offers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of two separate discount offers on Kiss My Keto's homepage&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of visiting the site, Kiss My Keto offers new discounts to compete with their own affiliate partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what Nini said, these special offers compete against the affiliate’s referral credit. If the customer chooses a new discount, Kiss My Keto pays zilch to the affiliate who brought the customer to the site in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;confronting-the-ceo&quot;&gt;Confronting the CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#confronting-the-ceo&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the discrepancy between Kiss My Keto’s published rates and their actual payouts seemed misleading and maybe even constituted fraud. Nini offered to compensate me instead with Kiss My Keto products, “so [I] can create a new article and let’s see how it goes.” But that was clearly not our agreement. It was time to employ The Organized Professional Method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the following email to Alex Bird, Kiss My Keto’s CEO and co-founder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;31.319339298004&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nini has been professional and courteous in working with me, but she is currently describing a Kiss My Keto policy that is unacceptable, so I’m reaching out to you to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Refersion stats, I’ve driven 120 visitors to Kiss My Keto through my referral links. I was surprised to see that after this many visitors, I had not been credited with any conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked Nini about this, she said that Kiss My Keto withholds payments based on exceptions that are not part of the published ambassador agreement. Specifically, Nini reported to me the following unpublished exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purchases of bundles, subscriptions, and bread products do not qualify for commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchases where the customer applies a sitewide discount do not qualify for commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kiss My Keto ambassador page states that the affiliate program &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/20pct-on-all.png&quot;&gt;pays 20% on sales of all Kiss My Keto products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These exceptions also directly contradict messaging from Kiss My Keto. […] On July 2nd, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/4th-of-july-codes.png&quot;&gt;Alec Mwali sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; encouraging ambassadors to “boost [our] earnings” by sharing Kiss My Keto’s 4th of July discount codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto owes Is It Keto the agreed upon 20% of all customer orders to your site that originated from Is It Keto’s referral link. This money is due to Is It Keto regardless of the product the customer purchased or the discount code that they applied, as the published agreement states a commission of 20% with no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m doing a few things in the email to adhere to The Organized Professional Method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I make no threats, nor do I express anger.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most heated thing I say is that the policy is “unacceptable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The email lays out facts that are objective and provably true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m firm but polite in what I want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wherever possible, I used our businesses’ names instead of saying “you” or “me.”
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This was a cold, emotionless business issue, not a request to validate my feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks, Alex still hadn’t responded, so I sent him this follow-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not received a response from you in response to my email dated July 17th, 2020 regarding Kiss My Keto’s failure to pay me its advertised commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I do not receive a response by Friday, August 7th, 2020, I will assume that Kiss My Keto is not willing to honor the ambassador agreement, and I will seek other means to recover the money owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to notice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’m mentioning specific dates, which hints at building a paper trail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one-week deadline discourages Alex from deferring his response indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt; at legal action but don’t explicitly threaten it.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If they failed to pay, my plan was to file a complaint with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov&quot;&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; and reach out to other affiliates suggesting they do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-put-it-blatantly-we-are-not-paying-you-for-your-conversions&quot;&gt;“To put it blatantly, we are not paying you for your conversions” &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#to-put-it-blatantly-we-are-not-paying-you-for-your-conversions&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I received a response from Michael Herscu, Alex’s co-founder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nini, our ambassador manager tells me we have already paid you for the most recent conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m being told you feel you are still owed for older campaigns that weren’t tracked properly. To put it blatantly, we are not paying you for your conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here[sic] the thing Michael… We can’t pull an arbitrary number out of a hat based on a number of conversions that you feel you were owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nini spoke to Refersion and they told her 0 conversions out of 95 clicks is not impossible so it seems your traffic simply did not convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible your affiliate link wasn’t working? Sure, anything is possible but Refersion assures us it’s working so I think it’s extremely unlikely this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any proof of conversions that weren’t tracked? If you do please share them here with me and we can address them. We will follow up with those customers to get to the bottom of the matter and of course, we will pay you out accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that are confusing about Herscu’s email that I need to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says, “we have already paid you.” Unbeknownst to me, Kiss My Keto had spontaneously begun paying me commissions on bread purchases (more on that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#calculating-the-debt&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). The day before Herscu responded to me, I received a PayPal payment for $26.60 for commissions I earned over the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herscu also seems to misunderstand the real issue. He was acting as though it was a simple matter of distrusting Kiss My Keto’s numbers. Though I was indeed skeptical of their numbers, I didn’t want to fight that battle because I had no evidence to prove any of my readers purchased something. What I could prove was that Kiss My Keto’s advertised pay structure differed from what their affiliate manager described to me privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded a few hours later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is not with Refersion’s stats but with Kiss My Keto’s policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss My Keto’s published Ambassador documentation states that Kiss My Keto pays “20% starting commission on sales of all Kiss My Keto products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 16th, Nini Perez stated in an email to me that there are exceptions to these terms. Specifically, Nini said that Kiss My Keto withholds commissions on sales of bread products or purchases made during a Kiss My Keto sitewide sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the information that Nini reported to me accurate? If so, where is that information published? All official documentation I can find says that the payout is 20% on all sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intentionally steered the conversation away from stats, as I had no way to prove anything about Kiss My Keto’s internal sales numbers, however dubious they might seem. By posing the question of published policies, I forced the conversation to a place where we share access to the same information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-process-this-payment&quot;&gt;“Please process this payment” &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#please-process-this-payment&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herscu responded half an hour later, this time in a less hostile tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/herscu-outcome.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 683px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/herscu-outcome_huf4ce7d075ee0fdc0fe4694fb7fa53d80_35010_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/herscu-outcome_huf4ce7d075ee0fdc0fe4694fb7fa53d80_35010_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/herscu-outcome.png 681w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/herscu-outcome.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Herscu asking 'how do you wish to resolve the matter? What outcome are you hoping for?'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a good sign. He asked what he can do to make me stop bothering him, so he appeared amenable to a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent this response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will consider this matter resolved if Kiss My Keto pays Is It Keto full commission based on the published Ambassador agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between June 16th and July 16th, Refersion’s statistics show that Is It Keto referred 120 visitors to Kiss My Keto and received credit for 0 conversions. I expect Kiss My Keto to pay the full 20% commission on any conversions that were excluded based on Kiss My Keto’s unpublished exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s difficult for Kiss My Keto to review the purchase history in that way, I would accept $88 as a fair estimate of my owed commissions. This number is based on the fact that I’ve earned $26.60 on 36 referrals since July 17th, which is $0.73 per referral. Extrapolating that to 120 visitors yields $88.66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He responded a few days later, agreeing to pay me the $88:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/seems-fair.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 665px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/seems-fair_hu6aeb1217eec6d77bee9b96a407dd181e_32465_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/seems-fair_hu6aeb1217eec6d77bee9b96a407dd181e_32465_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/seems-fair.png 663w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/seems-fair.png&quot; alt=&quot;Herscu responds: 'No worries Michael. $88 seems fair to me.'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calculating-the-debt&quot;&gt;Calculating the debt &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/#calculating-the-debt&quot; class=&quot;hanchor&quot; arialabel=&quot;Anchor&quot;&gt;🔗︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a logical inconsistency in my demand to Kiss My Keto. My original issue was that Kiss My Keto’s statistics seemed untrustworthy, so why was I suddenly treating everything after July 16th as reliable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something changed on July 16th that was very much in my favor. Suddenly, Kiss My Keto started crediting me for sales of bread, the thing they privately had claimed was ineligible for commission. Interestingly, my first commission occurred less than 24 hours after I emailed their CEO, Alex Bird:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase_hu18aeeacf7eb7155c9b58d6774c1c33ab_40411_300x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 300w, /collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase_hu18aeeacf7eb7155c9b58d6774c1c33ab_40411_600x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 600w, /collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase_hu18aeeacf7eb7155c9b58d6774c1c33ab_40411_800x0_resize_lanczos_2.png 800w, /collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase.png 962w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/collect-debt/kmk-bread-purchase.png&quot; alt=&quot;Herscu responds: 'No worries Michael. $88 seems fair to me.'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was great news for me because it gave me hard numbers to extrapolate my missing sales. When I had zero commissions, Kiss My Keto could simply claim that none of the customers who came from my site completed purchases. Without access to their internal receipts, I’d have no evidence to argue. By flipping on commissions for bread, they gave me a view into what my commissions &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have looked like the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the email exchange, I’ve collected more data, and now their accounting prior to July 16th seems even more suspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Period&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Days&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Referrals&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Credited purchases&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Commissions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Before emailing the CEO&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$0.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;After emailing the CEO&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$57.48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Fewer Is It Keto readers clicked these links in the second half because I stopped featuring Kiss My Keto as prominently on my site. I’ve since removed all mention of Kiss My Keto, as I no longer have any interest in helping them earn money, regardless of what they pay me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Kiss My Keto pay me because I convinced them that it was the ethical and just thing to do? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it looks like Kiss My Keto was violating their published policies, I had clear evidence of it, and $88 seemed like a cheap price to placate me. After my email to the CEO, they took down &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/iyoxj&quot;&gt;their affiliate policy page&lt;/a&gt;, and I started receiving commissions when customers I referred purchased bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Kiss My Keto thought my assertions were baseless and paid me $88 just to get me to buzz off, that’s still a win. Had I huffed and puffed and told them how mad I was, they would have simply stopped responding. Herscu started at, “to put it blatantly, we’re not paying you.” Two emails later, I brought him to, “$88 seems fair to me.” Even if all I did was convince him that $88 was cheaper than dealing with whatever nuisance I might cause, The Organized Professional Method created that impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this method frequently. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t, but I always find it to be the least stressful way of addressing disputes. When a company engages in bad behavior, I think about these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who in the organization can solve this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are their incentives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I demonstrate to them that I’m organized and capable of asserting my rights?&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey! Today I have something different for you. It’s a piece about the weird world of LinkedIn — from celebrity&lt;/em&gt; workfluencers &lt;em&gt;to the strange social features that feel out of place. This is a guest essay from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi&quot;&gt;Fadeke Adegbuyi&lt;/a&gt;, senior marketing manager at Doist and a fan of all things internet culture. I think you’re going to like it! 😆&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1181373145342758913&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Nobody:\n\nLinkedIn: \&amp;quot;Someone looked at your profile!

Nobody: LinkedIn: &quot;Someone looked at your profile! IF YOU GIVE US FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH WE WILL TELL YOU WHO IT IS&quot;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our collective confusion about the platform, its enthusiastic embrace by HR departments and recruiters has ensured its success. Even though it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.linkedin.com/2020/july/a-message&quot;&gt;forced to lay off 1,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; because of the pandemic, they still increased their Q&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2020-Q4/press-release-webcast&quot;&gt;4 revenue by 10%.&lt;/a&gt; As of Q3 of 2020, the company has over 722 million users and is truly international––just 26% of their members are based in North America. With revenue largely powered by recruiting solutions, paid job listings, and advertising, LinkedIn knows how to appeal to businesses at scale. LinkedIn doesn’t need &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the company’s consumer-side remains in the midst of a long-standing identity crisis. Feature bloat and odd idiosyncrasies make the site a superbly strange social network. Many of us have profiles but don’t log in for months at a time. Our “About” sections point to better ways to be reached. Others, seemingly alive and well, have claimed on their pages to have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1299378838049296385&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Well, that's one way to do it &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Austen&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Austen Allred&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Fri Aug 28 16:10:30 +0000 2020&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;photos&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;img_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/EghFIt2U8AIx5hE.jpg&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;link_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://t.co/6TJTnj8wGe&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;quoted_tweet&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;retweet_count&amp;quot;:29,&amp;quot;like_count&amp;quot;:1248,&amp;quot;expanded_url&amp;quot;:{}}&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn bills itself as an online destination, like a conference held at a 5-star hotel where big thinkers give big speeches, deals get made in private corners, and you can “build and engage with your professional network.” But many of us see it as a not-so-funhouse, with wacky mirrors, jumpout surprises, and peculiar attractions. Can I interest you in a tour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copy-Cat Cemetery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn recently released Stories, a vertical video feature copied from Instagram, who better stole it from Snapchat. LinkedIn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Stories%20enable%20members%20and,of%20their%20everyday%20professional%20moments.&amp;amp;text=LinkedIn%20shares%20Stories%20that%20you,recent%20version%20of%20the%20app.&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; users “share images and short videos of their everyday professional moments.” Released in the midst of a global pandemic during a mass migration to remote work, it’s unclear whether we should showcase cramped work setups on kitchen tables or restless kindergarteners interrupting the 143rd minute of a Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available only on LinkedIn's iOS and Android apps, this begs the question...&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is using LinkedIn on their phone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The platform would like you to believe that celebrities are. A permanent Story from LinkedIn shows a reel of workfluencers ––Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra –– posting professionally shot high-definition videos of their work days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;captioned-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-971-1456&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40ac9496-fcd6-4638-9b55-64f17ba91976_1600x1067.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:971,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1456,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tagline ends the montage: “Share your story.” At last glance, only a single one of my 1000+ connections is using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Twitter is seeing early success with Fleets, their own copy-cat story feature that users have been receptive to, posting baby photos and dog pictures in between subtweets and shitposts. Feature imitation isn’t a bad strategy. But LinkedIn Stories was dead on arrival. No one in the boardroom asked the critical question: &lt;em&gt;Who cares?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Audio Trolls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio apps, like Clubhouse, Chalk, and Rodeo point to the power of sound-based social. Twitter released voice tweets earlier this spring and is currently working on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/&quot;&gt;audio spaces feature&lt;/a&gt;. LinkedIn has taken their own steps into voice with a handful of audio features. Like most things on the platform, they feel out of place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment behind their name pronunciation feature on personal profiles is a positive one, but hasn’t seen wide adoption for its intended purpose. Since the feature was launched, I’ve heard people with the most pronounceable of names use the feature for anything from inserting a 10-second clip from The Office to playing a song snippet at 2x speed. A now common but unintended use case is delightful trolling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeffistyping/status/1304947619651817477?s=21&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;name pronunciation &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;jeffistyping&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;jeff ☃️&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sun Sep 13 00:58:51 +0000 2020&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;photos&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;img_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/yo3jqga19shqkgesigav&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;link_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://t.co/vLbpi1gxsN&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;quoted_tweet&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;retweet_count&amp;quot;:140,&amp;quot;like_count&amp;quot;:1481,&amp;quot;expanded_url&amp;quot;:{}}&quot;&gt;

name pronunciation &lt;img class=&quot;tweet-photo&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/yo3jqga19shqkgesigav&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a site where people declare Ivy League associations, summa cum laude status, and internships at investment banks, cheeky irreverence for work culture warps the throughline of respectability that LinkedIn intends. Trolling LinkedIn, while on LinkedIn, is a break from the BusinessTM of polished headshots and corporately crafted “Experience” sections. It’s ironic participation on a platform where you’re &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to be performing professionalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, it feels like LinkedIn is actively building features for the intended purpose of trolling. Within LinkedIn messages, users can hold down a microphone icon to record their voice. An audio snippet is an oddly intimate option for starting a professional conversation with a stranger. Perhaps that’s the point. But attempting to speed up relationships with overly familiar features is a “personal touch” unwelcome in the world of networking, already so fraught with faux pas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innocent but outlandish 39-second audio message, sent by “&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21&quot;&gt;Jimmy from LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;” went viral as a case of networking-gone-not-quite-right: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello Candice, how are you doing and good morning. How have you been? Hey Candice, this is me, Jimmy from LinkedIn. And the reason I was giving you this quick voice message call was to say thank you so kindly. I really appreciate that you have accepted me here on the LinkedIn platform. What we will do is learn from each-other. I appreciate your kindness. Jimmy from LinkedIn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/okcandice_/status/1285956830045380608?s=21&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Was this really necessary Jimmy from LinkedIn????? &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;okcandice_&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;cc&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Wed Jul 22 15:16:14 +0000 2020&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;photos&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;img_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/apqn3wxe95r8osmjbpgt&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;link_url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://t.co/IOSBsC623C&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;quoted_tweet&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;retweet_count&amp;quot;:39882,&amp;quot;like_count&amp;quot;:234604,&amp;quot;expanded_url&amp;quot;:{}}&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

Was this really necessary Jimmy from LinkedIn????? &lt;img class=&quot;tweet-photo&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/apqn3wxe95r8osmjbpgt&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it doesn’t feel malicious, it’s just &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; to encounter this kind of weirdness in the same space you seek new job opportunities and professional updates from former colleagues and classmates. It’s the stuff that makes you pause and say, &lt;em&gt;Where am I?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;InMail Infinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the platform, bringing professionals together, is a challenging one from the start. People hate networking. Also, they’re bad at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/mikegiannulis/status/1329217770769281029&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;full_text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;span class=\&amp;quot;tweet-fake-link\&amp;quot;&amp;gt;@BrennerSpear&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; I am becoming more and more convinced that 95% of Linkedin Messaging is just the suggested text.\n\n\&amp;quot;Congrats on 6 Years At Accenture, Bill!\&amp;quot;\n\n\&amp;quot;Thanks, Michael!\&amp;quot;\n\n\&amp;quot;My Pleasure, Bill.\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;mikegiannulis&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Michael Giannulis | CEO | Entrepreneur | Investor&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Thu Nov 19 00:19:46 +0000 2020&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;photos&amp;quot;:[],&amp;quot;quoted_tweet&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;retweet_count&amp;quot;:5,&amp;quot;like_count&amp;quot;:66,&amp;quot;expanded_url&amp;quot;:{}}&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;tweet-fake-link&quot;&gt;@BrennerSpear&lt;/span&gt; I am becoming more and more convinced that 95% of Linkedin Messaging is just the suggested text. &quot;Congrats on 6 Years At Accenture, Bill!&quot; &quot;Thanks, Michael!&quot; &quot;My Pleasure, Bill.&quot;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For users, LinkedIn “networking” often means receiving a barrage of InMail and connection requests. You might recognize some or all of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bad sales pitch&lt;/strong&gt;: Sales people and business development people will slide into DMs to peddle their company’s products, whether you’re the right person to buy or not. Usually not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The professional neg&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruiters ask senior level employees if they’re interested in entry level roles or, better yet, internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The just-in-case connection&lt;/strong&gt;: Industry peers will suggest it’s “mutually beneficial” to connect, but don’t specify these benefits up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The endangered business school&lt;/strong&gt;: Admissions teams are now online shilling once-coveted seats in their dwindling MBA programs. Based on your profile and experience, they think you’re a “great fit” and want you to apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eager seeker&lt;/strong&gt;: Some people see LinkedIn messages as an alternative resume and cover letter submission portal. This is why that endless string of people in your messages inquire about roles outside your department… or outside your company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The LinkedIn team&lt;/strong&gt;: If their emails notifying you about connection requests wasn’t enough, LinkedIn also maintains a direct line to your InMail. Expect prompts to try Premium, credits to advertise your company, and messages about whatever else they’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proposition&lt;/strong&gt;: Linkedin stands in the long-tradition of &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; site becoming a dating site. Or, er, a place to sexually harass people. If you haven’t gotten one of these messages in your InMail, you know someone who has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;captioned-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-437-1456&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de8db43f-b1b6-454a-83a2-fe92f9bed869_1600x480.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:437,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1456,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overfull InMail and random connection requests feels like a never-ending chore. You get enough work emails and don’t need any more. LinkedIn’s constant drip of communication is just more work on top of the real work you have to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkedin’s inbox infinity isn’t just annoying—it detracts from the usability of the platform. Unless you’re embracing a new position of processing and answering everything that comes through, if a real connection came along, how would you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cursed Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any given point on your LinkedIn timeline, you’ll see a corporate blog post shared by someone you know, a marketing sales pitch from someone you don’t, and a news story about COVID-19. Their timeline is similar in this way to other social networks, where you see posts made or liked by your connections, people and brands you follow, and promoted posts that people pay to get in front of you. This cacophony of content is bizarre, but not atypical –– social feeds optimize for engagement, here as everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s uniquely odd about LinkedIn is that it is not unique. “The professional network” is still just a social network. Though the topics of the posts in your timeline may be on the world of work, diving into the comments, you can see polarization in action. Inspirational posts on giving parents grace while working from home during the pandemic have angry rants suggesting that kids are a personal choice and their burden shouldn’t be foisted upon colleagues. Beneath articles on workplace harassment, sympathetic discussions ensue on why someone might naturally retaliate after being romantically rebuffed. A political article about the 2020 US presidential election draws comments on whether former President Barack Obama was really Black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;captioned-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-248-1456&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96580804-aafd-41cc-896c-028a895490d6_1600x272.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:248,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1456,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time when the collective conversation is consumed by the topic of human cancellation, people readily post things on LinkedIn that make them fireable or unhireable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;captioned-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-491-1456&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758c1270-4c2a-4e06-8dbc-7dc0e356a568_1600x540.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:491,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1456,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these comments are nothing new in terms of online culture, they feel out of bounds on a professional website where people use their full names and disclose precisely where they work and the city they live in. In the alternate universe of LinkedIn, cancel culture either doesn’t exist, its inhabitants are blissfully unaware, or they simply don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Rockstar Recruiters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strangest of Linkedin’s features isn’t a feature at all; it’s a specific set of power users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every platform has its royalty. On Instagram it's influencers, foodies, and photographers. Twitter belongs to the founders, journalists, celebrities, and comedians. On LinkedIn, it’s hiring managers, recruiters, and business owners who hold power on the platform and have the ear of the people. The depravity of a platform where HR Managers are the rockstars speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a job site, they’re the provisioners of positions and never miss the chance to regale their audience with their professional deeds: hiring a teenager with no experience, giving a stressed single mother a chance to provide for her family, or seeing past a candidate’s imperfections to give them a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These stories are relayed dramatically in what’s now recognizable as LinkedIn-style storytelling, one spaced sentence at a time, told by job-givers with a savior complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On LinkedIn, jobs are not a trade between an individual and a corporation, or a way to fill the space between 9 to 5. On LinkedIn, jobs are life-affirming or life-&lt;em&gt;saving&lt;/em&gt; opportunities, rescuing people from a life of meaningless toil or imminent ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;captioned-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-1362-896&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13b43e7-1308-4453-a045-99ebd4bdda19_896x1362.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa13b43e7-1308-4453-a045-99ebd4bdda19_896x1362.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a13b43e7-1308-4453-a045-99ebd4bdda19_896x1362.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:1362,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:896,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bahman-ramedani_behuman-activity-6713781097190236160-xEl0/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, straight from the weird world of LinkedIn, people use Skype in 2020, hiring managers give unsolicited feedback on performance at the end of an interview, and contracts are flourished and signed immediately. Readers get everything they would ever want out of a story in under 250 words: conflict, a tragic confessional, a change of heart, a happy ending, and a valuable lesson on how to #behuman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of infinite entertainment and peak television, over 783,438 people were moved to leave a reaction on a story that’s probably not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the comments underneath reveal a depth of sincerity, divine blessings, and extended admiration. Imitation is flattery and this story was so compelling that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%20I%20interviewed%20a%20candidate%20through%20Skype%20last%20week.%20During%20the%20call%2C%20I%20heard%20crying%20in%20the%20background.%20&amp;amp;origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&quot;&gt;dozens of people have stolen and co-opted&lt;/a&gt; it, hoping for their own viral moment. LinkedIn doesn’t market itself as a place for “quick bites,” but feeds are overflowing with these types of stories each day, and they capture attention—both on the platform and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken out of context of the LinkedIn cinematic universe and shared on Twitter, these stories are a point of derision rather than admiration, and inspire parody more than parroting, underscoring the differences between LinkedIn and other social platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn story-telling, driven by Rockstar Recruiters and other job provisioners, has evolved, as work has evolved. Browsing LinkedIn several years ago revealed the same line-by-line storytelling, but anecdotes that were thematically different. Then, the pendulum of storytelling swung toward hustle culture. Timelines were filled with team-building entrepreneurs doing their best Gary Vaynerchuk impression, imploring their followers to work more, try harder, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOJ4FEbLbb0&amp;amp;ab_channel=GaryVee&quot;&gt;eat shit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to get ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruiters were gatekeepers who used LinkedIn to share the best ways to &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; access to them and get your resume thrown in the digital dustbin. While this brand still exists on the platform, it’s dwarfed by the new era of micro storytelling—empathy is trending. Now, the platform’s viral stories are about “bringing your whole self to work,” self-care, and finding work-life balance in a busy world. In light of how work has changed because of the pandemic, micro storytellers instruct us on having compassion for colleagues behind the screen, and the dangers of burnout with remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the accompanying economic downturn and the increased pressure when it comes to job searches, recruiters are selling HR as friends of the downtrodden, willing to look past less job experience and unbrushed hair when it comes to assessing candidates and giving them the coveted offer letter. In fact, they even prefer it! In the Land of LinkedIn, the young, hungry, and stupid are always better bets than the polished, professional, and competent. LinkedIn is filled with these stories about work –– real, exaggerated, and imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced to its simplest form, LinkedIn is a digital resume. A profile consists of your past work experience, education, skills, and references. The posts, comments, and messages are like a cover letter. But we’ve long decided that there are better ways to showcase your ability than a list of the places you’ve worked, the school you went to, and a hastily drafted plea for work. Resumes are old scrolls of a bygone era. If LinkedIn is a site meant to demonstrate you’re an expert, it’s competing against all the places you can do this better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have GitHub, designers use Dribbble, and Academics maintain their ResearchGate or Google Scholar profiles. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paigefinnn/status/1316957862275461121&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where an ethos of entertainment first, professionalism second makes “networking” more natural and even more effective. Plus, there’s personal websites and portfolios. Everyone is building a personal brand, they’re just not doing it on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional platform doesn’t quite work because it's a collection of contradictions. It's the site with millions of users that nobody you know uses. It’s where you put your resume, but never apply for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, many of us have a profile and might even maintain it, adding a new role when we make a professional move. We may venture into InMail Infinity, not knowing whose invite to accept and in the end accepting them all. Some of us even “like” updates from promoted friends and former colleagues who are also performing professionalism, probably just as ambivalent about the platform as we are. Keeping our page current, skimming messages, and doing the very least to ensure our network doesn’t forget us is a “just-in-case” mentality powered by some level of professional anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a job, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; lose it. If you don’t, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we stay. Even if it sucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is bizarre because it tries to make this hostage situation fun. Even though it’s not. Not when you add stories, audio messages, DMs, a social feed, or anything else. The platform might be less &lt;em&gt;alternate universe&lt;/em&gt; and more down to earth if the truth was acknowledged: performative professionalism, job hunting, and networking are extensions of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; not play. As long as LinkedIn pretends otherwise, we can also pretend that we’ll never be desperate enough to use it in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>InstaHide Disappointingly Wins Bell Labs Prize, 2nd Place</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;420.38180259963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[What follows are my thoughts on some recent research in machine learning privacy. These are my thoughts, and do not represent those of others.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02772&quot;&gt;InstaHide&lt;/a&gt; (a recent method that claims to give a way to train neural networks while preserving training data privacy) was just awarded the 2nd place &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/03/2139411/0/en/Nokia-announces-2020-Bell-Labs-Prize-winners.html&quot;&gt;Bell Labs Prize&lt;/a&gt; (an award for “finding solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing the information and telecommunications industry.”). This is a grave error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell Labs brought to the world the very foundations of information theory, the transistor, the C programming language, and the UNIX operating system. The world today would certainly not be what it is without Bell Labs. So when InstaHide was awarded the 2nd place Bell Labs Prize earlier this week, I was deeply disappointed and saddened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're not deeply embedded in the machine learning privacy research community, InstaHide is a recent proposal to train a neural network while preserving training data privacy. It (ostensibly) allows someone to train a machine learning model on a bunch of sensitive training data, and then publish that model, without fear that the model leaks anything about the training data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Attack on InstaHide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2020/instahide/instahide_is_not_private.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it turns out that InstaHide offers no privacy. It is not private for any reasonable definition of privacy, and given the output of InstaHide it is possible to completely recover the inputs that went in to it. We showed this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05315&quot;&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; (and if you're reading this within the next few days, we'll be giving a talk on this paper at the PPML workshop at NeurIPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a grave error that InstaHide was awarded this prize because of how fundamentally misguided InstaHide is---both the idea itself and the methodology of the paper. Drawn to the right is what we're able to do: given a set of encoded images that try to preserve some notion of privacy, we recover extremely high fidelity reconstructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning on leaving things as they were after we wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05315&quot;&gt;our attack paper&lt;/a&gt;. But after watching the award ceremony, and the response to it, I felt compelled to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this award really gets to me is that InstaHide really is a culmination of all the weaknesses that machine learning papers tend to have, ranging from focusing on having a good story over a good technique, to the fact that the claims aren't refutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this paper was written by several authors, I place no blame on the first author of this paper, a early-career PhD student who executed on this idea with care and precision. This paper is exceptionally well written, and the experiments are performed carefully and rigorously. Having worked with the InstaHide implementation over the last month, the code is correct, easy to follow, and something that other researchers should strive for when doing their own code releases. The figures in this paper are clear and provide justifications for the claims. Everything a first author should be expected to do has been done flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of what follows, when I refer to “the InstaHide authors” I am talking about the senior authors on this paper who should know better. Among them, they have two Godel prizes, 80,000 citations, and i-10 index of over 400. The first is &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; without fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go into great detail below, but to briefly summarize, here's a short explanation of what goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide makes no refutable claims.&lt;/strong&gt; The key difference between science and pseudoscience is that claims in science are falsifiable. There must exist a way to disprove the claim. InstaHide makes no falsifiable privacy claims, and instead states their algorithm is private, without ever defining what this means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide moves the privacy goalposts.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the paper itself does not make refutable claims, the authors release a contest that can be solved. So we did just that: and broke the contest (completely). The author's response to this is to say that InstaHide wasn't intended to be a bullet-proof scheme anyway, and so it's not surprising their challenge can be solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide is complicated just for show.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of building the simplest possible scheme that might offer privacy, InstaHide builds a scheme that is complicated because it makes the visual pictures look prettier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide's fake complexity undermines the scheme.&lt;/strong&gt; Normally artificial complexity is an effective no-op; in this case, because of an implementation bug, the fake complexity actually allows a complete attack on the scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide has spurious theorems.&lt;/strong&gt; Theorems of privacy are important, however InstaHide gives theorems that while mathematically true, are independent of the security or privacy of the scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;InstaHide disregards technical rigor.&lt;/strong&gt; Statements that are very precisely defined in the literature, such as indistinguishability, are thrown around cavalierly. Arguing something is indistinguishible requires work, but the paper runs a single statistical test instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The InstaHide authors continue to promote it.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes defenses get broken. That's part of life in computer security. When this happens, it's necessary to admit it's broken, and try to fix it or move on to a new proposal. Instead, the InstaHide authors continue to promote their work as if it is effective, without regard to reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose some hospital wanted to train the world's greatest medical imaging scanner that can take a scan of your body, run a fancy machine learning model over it, and tell you all the problems you have. To do this, they'd certainly need a lot of training data: images from individual people with their scans, and the list of problems they do (or don't) have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't want to just give some random organization all the scans I've ever had of my body. They're my private images. What if they got leaked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training data privacy schemes give a way for someone to train a machine learning model on this private data without having to worry that their training data will be leaked. Most schemes published today are &lt;strong&gt;provably correct&lt;/strong&gt;: there is a formal argument that, unless there is an error in the proof, states my data can never be leaked from the trained model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, cryptosystems like RSA or AES are not provably secure and we use them anyway. However these systems explicitly aim to be as simple as possible to make analysis easy. This is fairly independent from what we're talking about, because privacy schemes do tend to be provably secure.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these schemes are often slow, and usually degrade the accuracy of the final model. This is not ideal, but such is the cost of correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InstaHide is a proposal for how to achieve this result with a fairly simple algorithm that does not increase model training time, and also does not cause huge accuracy drops. This is clearly an important end goal, and we should be excited by any scheme that tries to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea behind InstaHide is a simple two-step process. To encode any particular private image, combine it together with a bunch of other random images, and then randomly flip the signs of the pixels in the image. (InstaHide normalizes pixels to [-1,1] before taking the sign.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's wrong? Well, go grab your popcorn. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide makes no refutable claims.&lt;/h2&gt;
One of the core tenents of modern science (for, oh, the past hundred years) is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability&quot;&gt;claims should be refutable&lt;/a&gt;: if the claim is false, there must exist an experiment which could disprove it. This is what separates science from pseudoscience. Unfortunately, InstaHide does not make falsifiable claims. It claims to offer privacy without ever defining what this means. This is a common failing in many papers on the security and privacy of machine learning, but no recent paper exemplifies this better than InstaHide.
&lt;p&gt;A typical privacy definition will say something of the form “it is not possible to learn property X about the training dataset if Y holds true”. For example, differential privacy says that it is not possible to distinguish between the case that a particular user is or is not in the dataset. The InstaHide paper has &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; refutable privacy claims. It defines an algorithm, and says it is private, without ever saying what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it's impossible to ever write a paper that claims to break it, because defining an attack necessarily requires a definition to break. The best one can do (and indeed, what we do in our paper) is to define potential definitions of what InstaHide &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; mean by privacy, and show that it doesn't satisfy &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; definitions. But it's always possible that there exists some definition of privacy that InstaHide does satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the authors do release the InstaHide Challenge: a contest where they ask researchers to try and break the privacy of InstaHide under the strongest possible settings. Here, breaking the privacy &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; well defined: given the output of the InstaHide algorithm, we are asked to try and reconstruct the original dataset. Even if the algorithm isn't refutable, at least this contest is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Challenge (and the source code for the algorithm) was released &lt;strong&gt;four months&lt;/strong&gt; after the initial paper was being presented and discussed in public. The fact that there was this huge delay meant that, for the first four months, it was impossible to say InstaHide is insecure with any certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the authors had released the challenge on time, early on when the paper was still being considered for the Bell Labs prize, would it have gotten an award? I suspect not. (Now it's still inexcusable that it got an award given our attack came out a month before the prize. But I expect if it had been broken a few weeks after being published it wouldn't have received a prize at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the week after the authors released the challenge, we solved it. We proposed two attacks, one breaking the fundamental algorithm and another breaking the implementation of the challenge. So at least we know the challenge data is not private. But this brings us to the next issue...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide moves the privacy goalposts.&lt;/h2&gt;
After publishing our attack, Sanjeev Arora (the senior author on the paper) responded in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/11/instahide/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;“InstaHide was never intended to be a mission-critical encryption like RSA”&lt;/em&gt;. First: what?! Second: this was never mentioned in the paper, and was stated only after we broke it. Third: no algorithm should be designed to only offer “some” security in the best case. Algorithms are designed to be able to be (nearly) perfectly secure, and as soon as any weaknesses are discovered they are discarded for stronger approaches or fixed to maintain strong security.
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it was clear that DES, (or MD5, or SHA-1) had any weakness at all, cryptographers started designing completely new algorithms to replace them. These replacement algorithms were, obviously, designed to be completely secure. Even if the defender has only very limited compute, cryptographic algorithms still argue security against adversaries who are orders of magnitude more powerful. Just because the defender can only run on 1 watt of power doesn't meant the adversary can't run on a compute cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to get technical for a second, I should really discus security parameters. This is the value that controls “how strong” a scheme is. Many algorithms (like RSA) can be made much less secure if you pick a low value of this parameter. However, importantly, that's easy to avoid---just pick a big one! InstaHide has no security parameters, and so it can not be made more secure by adjusting a few constants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguing that InstaHide is not intended for mission-critical encryption only after it is broken---and even then calling the attack &lt;em&gt;“not yet a cost-effective attack in the intended settings”&lt;/em&gt;---is nothing short of moving the goalposts. And this is what you can do when you don't make any claims the first time around. InstaHide was intended to be secure. It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Briefly, on to the claim that the attack is not cost effective. The attack takes roughly 12 hours of P100 GPU time. On AWS or GCP this costs less than 20 USD to rent. Now $20 isn't nothing, it's certainly more expensive than free. But when DES was first broken it cost $250,000 USD to build the machine, and a few days of compute time to break a single key. A P100 GPU is $2500 (exactly 100 times cheaper, not inflation adjusted) and the attack is at least a few times faster. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide is complicated for just show.&lt;/h2&gt;
It is important for papers to have a compelling story behind the technique, not just introduce a technique that advances the state of the art. And often this means that by artificially introducing complexity where none is required, a paper can be made to look more significant than it is.
&lt;p&gt;InstaHide does exactly this. At some point in their algorithm, InstaHide has a list of numbers [1, 3, -5, 7, -2]. It needs to increase the privacy of this list of numbers, so it multiplies each value by either 1 or -1 (chosen at random). So for example if we select [-1, 1, 1, -1, -1] then we would get [-1, 3, -5, -7, 2]. The claim is this somehow now preserves the privacy of these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Original Image&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2020/instahide/cat.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Encoded Image&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2020/instahide/cat2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice InstaHide operates on images. Given an image represented as pixels in the range [0,255], InstaHide first converts each pixel to be in the range [-1,1]. Then, after merging a few images together, it multiplies each pixel by either 1 or -1 as shown above. So it takes this image here on the left of a cat that we might regard as private, and converts it to an “encoded” version of the image on the right where each pixel has been multiplied by either 1 or -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good, right? Really hard to see what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astute reader might observe that all we have done is just remove the sign information of the original list. Because we've multiplied by either 1 or -1, uniformly at random, we have information theoretically completely removed the sign. Thus, InstaHide could have (more simply) just released the absolute value of each item in the list: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]. This would reveal no more or less data than doing some weird sign flipping procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bother with this sign flipping, then? Well, it turns out there's something called a One Time Pad. This is a (provably secure) encryption algorithm that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt;, in a different setting, relies on masking a random list of numbers by multiplying each entry by 1 or -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so in order to say that InstaHide is like a perfect encryption algorithm, the authors have to introduce this crazy sign flipping procedure. Sure it would be simpler to describe it as taking the absolute value. But that wouldn't have a good story attached to it; it wouldn't be possible to call it something like an encryption algorithm. One time pads give a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Encoded Image&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2020/instahide/cat2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Corrected Image&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2020/instahide/cat3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if InstaHide had instead used the absolute value instead of flipping signs? Well, this. Clearly still a cat. But would the paper have gotten attention if it claimed that taking the absolute value was secure? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why fake complexity is dangerous. It takes something that's obviously a broken idea (taking the absolute value of a pixel in order to preserve its privacy somehow) and replaces it with something that looks sane. But sane it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: how do I know that this complexity is actually fooling people? In the award ceremony, the Bell Labs researcher presenting the award explicitly said &lt;em&gt;he doesn't understand how InstaHide is secure&lt;/em&gt;, but, and I quote, &lt;em&gt;“it works nonetheless”&lt;/em&gt;. No! It does not. But this complexity is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide's fake complexity undermines the scheme.&lt;/h2&gt;
Now in an ironic turn of events, it turns out that this fake complexity with sign flipping that InstaHide uses actually happens to introduce a completely new vulnerability that wouldn't be there if the authors had just taken the absolute value of the list of numbers. (To be clear, InstaHide already is broken. Our main attack breaks it in the general setting. It's just also broken as a result of a new attack because of this fake complexity.)
&lt;p&gt;This implementation uses a standard psudorandom number generator (PRNG) to create the random sign flipping mask. It turns out that PRNGs have the property that, given a few outputs, it's possible to learn their &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; and as a result can recover every subsequent output. Learning the state requires a little bit of work, but it's not all that hard (it takes roughly 100 CPU hours, at a cost of about $4 USD). So we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we can actually &lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt; the sign flipping procedure, and recover the original images. After doing this, InstaHide no longer offers any meaningful privacy. We can completely break the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if InstaHide had just taken the absolute value, then the sign information would &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have been destroyed. This attack would not work. But since the authors insisted on adding unnecessary complexity in order to make a show of things, they've actually weakened the scheme. Being complicated is not good. It introduces room for additional errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide has spurious theorems.&lt;/h2&gt;
There's this thing that machine learning research papers do where they propose Algorithm A, say in words it works, and then prove Theorem T. The problem is that Theorem T is often completely disjoint from whether or not Algorithm A works at all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341&quot;&gt;Lipton and Steinhardt&lt;/a&gt; call these &lt;em&gt;spurious theorems&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;The way InstaHide makes this error is as follows. In order to justify the security of the proposed approach, authors prove that &lt;em&gt;“For worst-case pixel-vectors, finding the k-image set is hard.”&lt;/em&gt; That is, they say that there exists a dataset that, if encrypted by InstaHide, would be hard to invert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim is true. There does exist a dataset that is hard to invert. But that says nothing about what happens for standard images. It's not helpful to show that there exists a case where things are hard, we must show that the problem is always hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to something like differential privacy, where the story is completely reversed. The proof here says that &lt;strong&gt;for all datasets&lt;/strong&gt;---no matter how pathological---privacy will be preserved. InstaHide claims only to be private on some pathological datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;InstaHide disregards technical rigor.&lt;/h2&gt;
The paper prominently states that &lt;em&gt;“Distributions of encryptions of different images are indistinguishable”&lt;/em&gt; in the caption of Figure 2 in their paper. This phrase might seem bland, but realize that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability&quot;&gt;indistinguishability&lt;/a&gt; actually means something &lt;em&gt;very specific&lt;/em&gt; in computer security papers: it means that &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; adversary can distinguish between two distributions with probability better than random guessing plus some exponentially small probability.
&lt;p&gt;This paper asserts the distributions are indistinguishable not with a proof, but because upon visual inspection of a histogram the distributions look like they overlap, more or less, plus a statistical test in an appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be absolutely insane if a paper proposing an encryption algorithm were to plot the frequency of 1s and 0s in an encrypted message and say “our algorithm outputs data indistinguishible from random, and you can tell because the probability of a 1 looks roughly equal to the probability of a 0” but this paper makes exactly this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The InstaHide authors continue to promote it.&lt;/h2&gt;
If everything up until this point were true, but the authors were to come out and say “we tried to introduce a scheme to increase training data privacy. it turns out our scheme doesn't work. we now understand this and are trying to build stronger schemes with privacy definitions.” then I wouldn't have written this post. The problem is that after seeing our break, this hasn't happened. They still argue that it's secure under some settings, didn't retract their submission from the Bell Labs award, and haven't yet (after a month) accepted our break on their Challenge leaderboard.
&lt;p&gt;(On November 3rd we sent a draft of our paper to the InstaHide authors. After some discussion, we provided a challenge solution to the authors with the results of our PRNG attack on the 8th, followed by the code to reproduce on the 10th. After a brief back and forth, on the 11th and 12th, the authors posted their blog post and asked us questions on our attack. On the 18th we asked to check the status on this submission and received no reply. Then, on the 30th, we filed a bug report in a last attempt to contact the authors and received no reply. Finally, on December 3rd, we also provided our second (fully-general) solution to the challenge. We received a reply to this the next day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope that we can achieve the end goals of InstaHide: privacy-preserving training that doesn't sacrifice accuracy or training time. This would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InstaHide does not offer this, however. And not only does it not offer privacy, it doesn't even define what it tries to offer. Future papers should not try and follow this path of ambiguity and hand-waving statements without precise claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; if that's your thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The Tragic Tale of DEC, the Computing Giant That Died Too Soon</title>

&lt;p&gt;When you think of leaders in the computing industry, your first thoughts probably turn to companies like Apple, Microsoft, and IBM. But flash back a few decades, and the leaders of those companies all would’ve gladly bowed down to Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, who began paving the way for everyone starting in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC identified a demand for more affordable and high-performing computing systems that could be used in scientific research and other technological settings. DEC introduced a mid-range computing solution, the minicomputer, at a time when the alternative was too bulky and costly for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9580&quot; src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif?x88029&quot; data-lazy-type=&quot;image&quot; data-src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/Papertape2-300x154.jpg?x88029&quot; alt=&quot;Paper tape&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/Papertape2-300x154.jpg 300w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/Papertape2-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/Papertape2.jpg 2021w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;Digital paper tape, circa 1970s
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its extensive lines of minicomputers, it also became involved with software as well as the internet (in the very, very early days of the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happened to DEC? Why did all the success and industry dominance they had for roughly three decades just suddenly slip away? Most argue that it was a failure of the company’s leadership to adapt to the changing direction that computing began to take in the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how DEC eventually lost it all, it’s important to take a look back at how it all began and why such a monumental shift in the computing industry could’ve been missed by such a critical leader in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;The Impressive (and Tragic) History of DEC in Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC’s story begins in 1957 with two men at &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; who had a theory and an idea for a business. It ends in roughly 1998 with the selling of the company to Compaq. Here is DEC’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1957&quot;&gt;1957&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working together in the Lincoln Laboratory at MIT, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson came up with the idea for DEC. They took notice of how popular the interactive computing machines were with students who visited the lab, as opposed to the batch processing machines that users couldn’t input data into or use for real-time feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olsen and Anderson also knew that these interactive machines could be made and sold cheaper, which would be another major draw for researchers and scientists who were craving the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating their original business plan, Olsen and Anderson were advised to shift the focus of their company from one around “computers” to instead one focused on “equipment.” There were just too many concerns from investors about the future of computing, and so that’s what they did. The plan for Digital Equipment Corporation was finalized and they received $70,000 to launch their new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sticking with the theme of keeping expenses light (not only for customers but for the company as well), they set up shop in an old wool mill in Maynard, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1958&quot;&gt;1958&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first product DEC created and sold was its Digital Laboratory Module. Staying true to its business plan, the initial product lines DEC focused on were modules, or electronic components, that were mounted to circuit boards. By the end of that year, DEC sold $94,000 worth of its first product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1960&quot;&gt;1960&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC began selling its first computer at the end of 1960. But it was aware of people’s reluctance to invest in “computer” technology at the time, so it named the computer a “programmable data processor”, or PDP. The first iteration of this product line (PDP-1) sold for $120,000 that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the remainder of the decade, DEC created over a dozen PDP variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1962&quot;&gt;1962&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;lazy lazy-hidden size-full wp-image-9579&quot; src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif?x88029&quot; data-lazy-type=&quot;image&quot; data-src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z.jpg?x88029&quot; alt=&quot;PDP-4s&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;511&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z.jpg 640w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z-300x240.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9579&quot; src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z.jpg?x88029&quot; alt=&quot;PDP-4s&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;511&quot; srcset=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z.jpg 640w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/3874706978_902597beb1_z-300x240.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;PDP-4 at the National Archives Auditorium, 1964
&lt;p&gt;DEC began the process of creating “new” models of the PDP that could be sold for much less than the original. For example, the PDP-4 was similar in most ways to the PDP-1, but it was slower and packaged differently, which is what enabled DEC to sell it for $65,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1964&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While continuing to release new PDPs into the market, DEC also charged forward in its delivery of new modules. The Flip Chip came out in 1964 and was meant to convert the PDP-4 to the PDP-7. Many of its subsequent module releases served a similar purpose: helping users convert their old computers to upgraded versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1965&quot;&gt;1965&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in this year when DEC released the PDP-8, which is widely recognized as the first successful commercial minicomputer. Part of this is due to the improvements made to this model, but a large reason for its commercial success was the price tag of $18,500 and the 50,000 customers they sold it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1970&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interim, DEC came up with a revamped version of their PDP line and released the PDP-11 minicomputer. Not only did it bring major upgraded features to their computing machines, it also was easier to use. By the time it stopped selling it in the 1990s, DEC sold over 600,000 of them, making it one of the most popular minicomputers ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the design of the computer, as well as its operating system, turned out to be immensely popular with other computing companies, that eventually ended up using it as inspiration for their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1971&quot;&gt;1971&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC made its first move into the European market in 1971, setting up manufacturing in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1974&quot;&gt;1974&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC became recognized as a Fortune 500 company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1978&quot;&gt;1978&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy lazy-hidden alignright wp-image-9585 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif?x88029&quot; data-lazy-type=&quot;image&quot; data-src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/VAX_11-780_intero-225x300.jpg?x88029&quot; alt=&quot;DEC VAX 11/780&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/VAX_11-780_intero-225x300.jpg 225w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/VAX_11-780_intero-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/VAX_11-780_intero.jpg 1536w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After widespread success with its PDP-11, DEC made the move into high-end computers and launched the Virtual Address eXtension, or VAX. This new 32-bit minicomputer (or supermini) line aimed to provide users with a wide array of computing resources that would be more affordable, powerful, and smaller than what companies like IBM could offer at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1982&quot;&gt;1982&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainbow 100 was created and was DEC’s first attempt to enter the personal computing space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1984&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC continued to stay busy during this time, regularly putting out new models of the VAX. The VAX 8600 came out in 1984 and became an instant bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1985&quot;&gt;1985&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC registered dec.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1988&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC was recognized as one of the premier leaders in computing when it was named the second largest computer company, just behind IBM. At the time, it had generated over $11 billion in revenue and had over 120,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1990&quot;&gt;1990&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC reported its first quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1991&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC reported its first annual loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1992&quot;&gt;1992&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founder Ken Olsen retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1994&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC released Alpha AXP, which was a 64-bit microprocessor created to solve the overly complicated circuit designs of its VAX computers and to ultimately speed up processing times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1995&quot;&gt;1995&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC launched AltaVista, one of the first ever search engines for the Internet. It became incredibly popular with users. During the first day of its launch, AltaVista received 300,000 visits. Two years later, it received 80 million hits every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.com/about/altavista/&quot;&gt;AltaVista&lt;/a&gt; persisted long past the end or, more accurately, the acquisition of DEC, it was eventually sold to Yahoo in 2003. By the time 2013 rolled around, it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1997&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other computer companies began to make moves for the flailing DEC. Intel was the first to step in when it purchased DEC’s microprocessor plant in Hudson. But even that $1.5 billion wasn’t enough to save the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1998&quot;&gt;1998&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official end of DEC as a standalone company came in 1998 when it was acquired by Compaq for $9.6 billion. Unfortunately, Compaq didn’t know what to do with DEC’s overseas business, and so it was inevitable that neither DEC nor Compaq would exist for much longer. That day came in 2002 when Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson&quot;&gt;What Is the Lesson Here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been many decades since the world was first introduced to DEC, and tech history buffs still enjoy talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? First, because it left such a lasting imprint on computing as we continue to know it, whether it was its contributions to computers, software, microchips, or even the internet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, because there is an important lesson here that every computer company should carefully study if they don’t want to fall victim to the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Quora thread that asked the question “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Digital-Equipment-Corporation-DEC-fail&quot;&gt;Why did Digital Equipment Corporation fail?&lt;/a&gt;” it was interesting to see so many previous DEC employees and members of the MIT community speak up about what they noted during their tenure there. Almost unanimously, they supported the theory—also commonly held by experts—that the failure of the company ultimately fell to the leaders who were unable to foresee what was coming in personal computing and were not able to take decisive or quick enough action in time to save the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;lazy lazy-hidden size-full wp-image-9584&quot; src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif?x88029&quot; data-lazy-type=&quot;image&quot; data-src=&quot;https://digital.com/wp-content/uploads/TSD_Computer_-Schreib_und_Burotechnik_DEC_ASCII_Computer-Terminal_digital_VT_100.jpg?x88029&quot; alt=&quot;VT-100&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the saddest thing about this is that DEC had long been considered the “best” and the inspiratioan for what so many after them set out to do. It’s not like it hadn’t made an attempt at personal computing when they released their Rainbow 100. So, how did it fail to see that the future of the mid-market minicomputer was waning and that a full shift over to personal computers was needed in order to ensure the company’s longevity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/lessons-from-ken-olsen-and-digital-equipment-corp/&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Harvard Business School, it wasn’t a lack of trying that took down DEC. It was the inflexibility of the business model they had so long relied upon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital Equipment Corp. had microprocessor technology, but its business model could not profitably sell a computer for less than $50,000. The technology trapped in a high-cost business model had no impact on the world, and in fact, the world ultimately killed Digital. But IBM Corp., with the very same processors at its disposal, set up a different business model in Florida that could make money at a $2,000 price point and 20% gross margins—and changed the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of why it happened or how the leadership behind DEC allowed it to happen, the legacy of this company will live on as it was willing to step up and introduce affordable and powerful computing solutions during a time when others were too afraid to.&lt;/p&gt;
