<title>Apple has pushed a silent Mac update to remove hidden Zoom web server</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has released a silent update for Mac users removing a vulnerable component in Zoom, the popular video conferencing app, which allowed websites to automatically add a user to a video call without their permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant told TechCrunch that the update — now released — removes the hidden web server, which &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;zoom-video-communications&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; quietly installed on users’ Macs when they installed the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said the update does not require any user interaction and is deployed automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video conferencing giant took flack from users following &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5&quot;&gt;a public vulnerability disclosure&lt;/a&gt; on Monday by Jonathan Leitschuh, in which he described how “any website [could] forcibly join a user to a Zoom call, with their video camera activated, without the user’s permission.” The undocumented web server remained installed even if a user uninstalled Zoom. Leitschuh said this allowed Zoom to reinstall the app without requiring any user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also released a proof-of-concept page demonstrating the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Zoom &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/a-vulnerability-in-zooms-mac-client-could-allow-websites-to-turn-on-cameras-without-permission/&quot;&gt;released a fixed app version on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Apple said its actions will protect users both past and present from the undocumented web server vulnerability without affecting or hindering the functionality of the Zoom app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update will now prompt users if they want to open the app, whereas before it would open automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple often pushes silent signature updates to Macs to thwart known malware — similar to an anti-malware service — but it’s rare for Apple to take action publicly against a known or popular app. The company said it pushed the update to protect users from the risks posed by the exposed web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom spokesperson Priscilla McCarthy told TechCrunch: “We’re happy to have worked with Apple on testing this update. We expect the web server issue to be resolved today. We appreciate our users’ patience as we continue to work through addressing their concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than four million users across 750,000 companies around the world use Zoom for video conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Preserving Laptop Stickers on MacBooks</title>
<link>https://grh.am/2019/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://grh.am/2019/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.9736842105263&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for the ‘I am interested’ form, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/GDo21LDt6TnVUmbH7&quot;&gt;find it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked the idea of putting stickers on my MacBook Pro, but have always avoided it for two key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resale&lt;/strong&gt; - By putting stickers on my laptop, I am either going to have to try to remove them again once I come to selling it, lowering my resale price because the laptop isn’t in near pristine condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage&lt;/strong&gt; - There is a worry that some stickers may leave a horrible hard-to-remove residue, or maybe leave a discolouration to the aluminium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would realistically buy a used high-end laptop, covered in someone else’s stickers which will likely mean nothing to them? Let alone running the risk that the stickers would leave a horrible sticky residue when you try to remove them or leave permanent marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the fact that some of your stickers may have some slight sentimental value. This may sound odd to some, but stickers can be a badge of honour – showing that you’ve been to certain conferences, or managed to pick up that ‘rare’ sticker for a certain popular language, software, or startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-idea-was-born&quot;&gt;An idea was born&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began thinking of ways to combat these issues. I came up with a small list of requirements that would satisfy my needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fairly invisible, without close inspection of the laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily removable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave zero trace even after months or years of application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Feature:&lt;/strong&gt; Something that can be kept, so that those sentimental stickers aren’t lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, I thought about trying to find a transparent vinyl material that could be cut to perfectly fit the retina MacBook Pro lid. Immediately the older-style iPhone screen protectors came to mind, which were a transparent and doubled as a protective layer to the top case. My issues with this approach were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They would be too easy to spot, due to their glossy shine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some brands were well known for turning yellow or orange after months of use (Orange-peeling).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sourcing the material appeared to be difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found what I was looking for…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototype&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is another market which has a very similar set of requirements - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autotrader.co.uk/content/guides/what-is-car-wrapping&quot;&gt;vehicle wrapping&lt;/a&gt;. They use high-quality vinyl ‘wraps’ (vinyl), allowing folks to alter the colour of their vehicle without an expensive respraying of the bodywork. The same technique is often used to provide entire printed coverage of some company vehicles etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began hunting &amp;amp; ordering as many samples as I could from various suppliers, where the colour appeared to very closely resemble that of the MacBook Pro aluminium Silver. &lt;em&gt;I don’t have a Space Grey device to test against, but I did see some samples which may certainly do the job for these too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are all of the samples applied together, to get an idea of which provides the best match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/samples.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A huge variety of colours - some matching better than others.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one sample standing-out as a particularly close match (from all angles, giving that metallic reflection we get from the silver aluminium), I ordered up a larger sample to give this a real shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these vinyl wraps are intended for vehicles, they come with some additional properties which are really useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purposely won’t leave any residue behind (and if they do, easy to remove)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard wearing, as they are used to battling the elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super easy to apply, thanks to tiny ‘channels’ carved into the adhesive side, making air bubbles non-existent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/cut-prototype.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The first prototype before application...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/final.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;And here it is fully applied. The Apple logo isn't perfect, but it'll do.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/corner.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Showing the corner and how well the colour matches.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was applied, it was time to go to the next level of Inception, and apply some stickers to the sticker…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/stickered-up.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/bash.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/head-on.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how it stayed for a number of months, to give it a true test. This laptop endured being crushed into a carry-on bag for a couple of conferences, the freezing winter of Estonia, and general wear-and-tear of being a working laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It held up really well, and in some cases I get the feeling it certainly prevented a couple of scratches that may have occurred otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-outcome&quot;&gt;The Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://grh.am/images/post/preserving-laptop-stickers-on-macbooks/presented.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;My MacBook Pro lid stickers, now preserved forever.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really pleased with how this turned out – the sticker came off wonderfully after getting one of the corners started. Once off, I stuck it to a piece of thick white card, and popped it in a frame. The end result looks fantastic. The same can not be said about my photography skills when it comes to shooting glass head-on… next time I’ll get a polarising filter to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the MacBook Pro lid? Immaculate. All it needed was a little wipe around the edges where dust and residue had collected to leave a sort of ‘outline’ where the sticker had been. Other than that, it was like new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interested&quot;&gt;Interested?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned this project a couple of times, and there has been a slight stirring of interest when I have done so. So, I am trying to gauge interest to see if I should consider producing these for people to buy – I have setup a short 5 question form to figure out popularity, machine sizes, colours etc. so please fill it out if you think this might be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/GDo21LDt6TnVUmbH7&quot;&gt;You can find the form here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a bonus question if you can think of a product name for this ‘thing’. I have some already, but none are jumping out at me just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DeepMind’s StarCraft II agent will play anonymously on battle.net</title>
<link>https://starcraft2.com/en-us/news/22933138</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://starcraft2.com/en-us/news/22933138</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental versions of DeepMind’s StarCraft II agent, AlphaStar, will soon play a small number of games on the competitive ladder in Europe as part of ongoing research into AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like the chance to help DeepMind with its research by matching against AlphaStar, you can opt in by clicking the “opt-in” button on the in-game popup window. You can alter your opt-in selection at any time by using the “DeepMind opt-in” button on the 1v1 Versus menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For scientific test purposes, DeepMind will be benchmarking AlphaStar’s performance by playing anonymously during a series of blind trial matches. This means the StarCraft community will not know which matches AlphaStar is playing, to help ensure that all games are played under the same conditions. AlphaStar plays with built-in restrictions that the DeepMind team has defined in consultation with pro players. A win or a loss against AlphaStar will affect your MMR as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAQ below reflects the team’s plans for AlphaStar as of the time of posting, but may be subject to change as their research goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Why is AlphaStar available to play on Battle.net?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Experimental versions of DeepMind's StarCraft II system, AlphaStar, will soon play a small number of games on Battle.net for a limited time as part of ongoing scientific research into artificial intelligence. We’re excited to offer our community a chance to contribute to this process by playing against AlphaStar in a small number of blind trial games that will allow DeepMind to benchmark its agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. What version of StarCraft II is AlphaStar playing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaStar will play on the latest version of StarCraft II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. What races can AlphaStar play as?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;. AlphaStar can play as and versus Terran, Zerg or Protoss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Why is AlphaStar playing anonymously?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; DeepMind is currently interested in assessing AlphaStar’s performance in matches where players use their usual mix of strategies. Having AlphaStar play anonymously helps ensure that it is a controlled test, so that the experimental versions of the agent experience gameplay as close to a normal 1v1 ladder match as possible. It also helps ensure all games are played under the same conditions from match to match. DeepMind will release the research results in a peer-reviewed scientific paper along with replays of AlphaStar's matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How will I be able to play against AlphaStar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaStar will play anonymously during a series of blind trial matches against players on the competitive ladder. Players will be paired against AlphaStar according to the normal matchmaking rules. You can change your preference to opt in or opt out at any time via the Versus screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How many variants of AlphaStar will play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; DeepMind will be benchmarking the performance of a number of experimental versions of AlphaStar to enable DeepMind to gather a broad set of results during the testing period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How likely am I to be matched against AlphaStar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Pairings on the ladder will be decided according to normal matchmaking rules, which depend on how many players are online while AlphaStar is playing. AlphaStar will play a small number of games for scientific test purposes, though we will not be revealing exactly when or how often this will happen to ensure that games remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How does AlphaStar perceive the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Like human players, AlphaStar perceives the game using a camera-like view. This means that AlphaStar doesn’t receive information about its opponent unless it is within the camera’s field of view, and it can only move units to locations within its view. All limits on AlphaStar’s performance were designed in consultation with pro players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How does AlphaStar interact with the game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaStar has built-in restrictions, which cap its effective actions per minute and per second. These caps, including the agents’ peak APM, are more restrictive than DeepMind’s demonstration matches back in January, and have been applied in consultation with pro players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Will AlphaStar play team matches or only 1v1?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaStar will only be playing 1v1 during these test matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. What regions will AlphaStar play in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, AlphaStar agents will play in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Will playing AlphaStar affect my MMR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; A win or a loss against AlphaStar will affect your MMR like any other game played on the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Will AlphaStar improve as it plays on the ladder? Will my games be used to help improve its strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; AlphaStar will not be learning from the games it plays on the ladder, as DeepMind is not using these matches as part of AlphaStar’s training. To date, AlphaStar has been trained from human replays and self-play, not from matches against human players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. What’s happening next with AlphaStar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Once AlphaStar has played enough test matches, the team at DeepMind will use the results to inform their ongoing research into artificial intelligence. They will release the research results in a peer-reviewed scientific paper along with replays of AlphaStar’s matches, and are working with us to explore what comes next for AlphaStar. If DeepMind has any other updates on AlphaStar, the community will be the first to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. I pressed the wrong button and opted in/opted out by accident. Can I change my preference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; If you change your mind about playing against AlphaStar, you can change your preference to opt in or opt out at any time via the Versus screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. How will my replays against AlphaStar be used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; DeepMind will use your replays and the game data they include as part of their scientific research assessing and describing the performance of the AlphaStar system. In particular, replays will help illustrate specific points about AlphaStar’s gameplay. For more information, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepmind.com/alphastar-privacy-policy-english&quot;&gt;the privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. I have a question about how DeepMind is processing my personal data. What should I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; You can contact DeepMind by emailing &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:replaydataqueries@deepmind.com&quot;&gt;replaydataqueries@deepmind.com&lt;/a&gt;. Please also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepmind.com/alphastar-privacy-policy-english&quot;&gt;the privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Developers don&amp;#039;t understand CORS</title>
<link>https://fosterelli.co/developers-dont-understand-cors</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fosterelli.co/developers-dont-understand-cors</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;ablack&quot; href=&quot;https://fosterelli.co/developers-dont-understand-cors&quot;&gt;Developers don't understand CORS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 10, 2019 — Chris Foster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about working in full stack consulting is that I get to work with a great number of developers with different skill levels in companies from various sizes and industries. This provides an opportunity to see what universal struggles come up. One that seems common and relevant recently is this: Too many web developers do not understand how CORS works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems particularly timely to point out because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5&quot;&gt;recent Zoom vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. Security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh found Zoom has a web server listening on the machine at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:19421&lt;/code&gt;. When you load a Zoom link, Zoom’s website sends a request to the localhost webserver and tells it to open up the native Zoom app. The whole article is worth a read, but these parts stuck out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that, instead of making a regular AJAX request, this page instead loads an image from the Zoom web server that is locally running. The different dimensions of the image dictate the error/status code of the server. You can see that case-switch logic here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fosterelli.co/image/developers-dont-understand-cors/images.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question I asked is, why is this web server returning this data encoded in the dimensions of an image file? The reason is, it’s done to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). For very intentional reasons, the browser explicitly ignores any CORS policy for servers running on localhost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last sentence is incorrect – Chrome does &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743#c17&quot;&gt;respect CORS headers&lt;/a&gt; for localhost webservers. If you’re a web developer you’ve probably done this when you have Create React App with your frontend app on one port and your backend API on another port. Your app is making cross origin requests against localhost, and this is supported in all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this says to me is that Zoom may have needed to get this feature out and did not understand CORS. They couldn’t make the AJAX requests without the browser disallowing the attempt. Instead, they built this image hack to work &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; CORS. By doing this, they opened Zoom up to a big vulnerability because not only can the Zoom website trigger operations in the native client and access the response, but every other website on the internet can too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would a secure implementation of this feature look like? The webserver listening in on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:19421&lt;/code&gt; should implement a REST API and set a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header with the value &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://zoom.us&lt;/code&gt;. This will ensure that only Javascript running on the zoom.us domain can talk to the localhost webserver. Further, to stop pages being able to open Zoom meetings automatically in the background zoom.us should have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP&quot;&gt;Content Security Policy&lt;/a&gt; header that blocks rendering within an iframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still leaves the vulnerability that any page can redirect your browser to a zoom.us link for a meeting that you didn’t expect, but this is a user experience decision that Zoom has made rather than a software vulnerability. Personally, I think the approach is wrong here too. They mention they desired a better user experience by opening the application directly, but one of the rules of good user experience design is that your software must be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am clicking a link, I expect that it will not suddenly make my camera and microphone available to people I do not know. Zoom is breaking this expectation. Even if they don’t want the built-in browser popup for UX reasons, put this popup in-app! Google Meet does this well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fosterelli.co/image/developers-dont-understand-cors/meet.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to take away from the CORS focus of this post. Regardless of the user experience side of the argument, running a webserver on localhost is a risky endeavour to begin with. It should absolutely not be providing privileged access to functions, such as &lt;em&gt;installing software&lt;/em&gt;, to every website on the internet. CORS enables you to securely do this – don’t hack around it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t know for sure if failure to understand CORS is why Zoom implemented the feature this way. However, I’ve talked to a few people and none of us can collectively find any legitimate reason to implement their existing approach. On reddit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cavblo/zoom_zero_day_4_million_webcams_maybe_an_rce_just/etdw0qn/&quot;&gt;lerunicorn did find and suggest&lt;/a&gt; that Firefox may block XHRs from secure to non-secure origins which could explain the motivation behind this approach. However, Firefox supports this when the origin is localhost. Further, native apps can generate a unique self-signed certificate. Alternatively, they could have used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://palant.de/2019/04/11/bogus-security-mechanisms-encrypting-localhost-traffic/&quot;&gt;browser extension&lt;/a&gt;. In any possible case, this is not a valid reason to forget to filter origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just Zoom. Anecdotally, lots of developers I’ve talked with don’t understand well how CORS works. There’s also very a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Access-Control-Allow-Origin+node&quot;&gt;generous quantity of examples&lt;/a&gt; from questions on Stack Overflow. Unfortunately, these are often paired with pages that recommend very insecure defaults like &lt;a href=&quot;https://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; in express which would make your application vulnerable if copied verbatim. Other vendors have been caught with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1663&quot;&gt;exact same vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; found in Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers just want to get their code to work, and bypassing the same-origin policy entirely might get it to work, but when someone finds out what you’ve done you’ll get problems like Zoom has now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen CORS confusion from both experienced and new developers. Is the CORS API too complex and confusing, or do we only need better developer education around issues like CORS and CSP? I’m not sure, but the current approach definitely doesn’t seem like it’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Project Vesta – Mitigating climate change with green sand beaches</title>
<link>https://projectvesta.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://projectvesta.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race to become the first carbon-neutral country is on and even countries with 100% renewable power sources will struggle to offset the CO2 created from the internal combustion engines of non-electric vehicles and industrial factories. By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the spreading of olivine on their coastlines, countries will have a scalable and financially viable technique available today, that can allow them to reach their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Costa Rica, which is looking to decarbonize completely by 2050, has an issue that 60% of its emissions are currently generated by vehicles. Even though they had 300 days of 100% renewable energy generation last year, they still have to deal with the emissions of all those vehicles. It will take decades to switch to an all-electric fleet and requires new infrastructure and societal conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica has ample shelf-sea coastlines and warm enough water alongside the entire country that they could deploy olivine on a large scale nearly anywhere they desire. With a 2016 level of only 1.71 tons of CO2 emissions per capita, it would only require 1.368 tons of olivine to be weathered per person to remove 100% of their CO2 footprint. At that scale, even with the price of olivine at $20 per ton, it would cost just $27.72 per person for the country to be 100% carbon neutral (removing an equivalent of the country’s yearly total output of 8,328.9 kt of CO2).  With a population of 4.9 million and a GDP of $57 billion, the $135,994,320 cost for the project would be less than 0.2% of their GDP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Dear Google, I&amp;#039;m Blocking You from My Website</title>
<link>https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/</guid>
<description>&lt;small&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-07-10T00:00:00+00:00&quot;&gt;July&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-07-10T00:00:00+00:00&quot;&gt;10&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-07-10T00:00:00+00:00&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have pretty strong opinions about “dark patterns” on the web. I hate obtrusive advertisements, 3rd party trackers, anti-UX modals and pop-ups, hidden data collection - the list goes on and on. I understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; these practices have been implemented over the years, but I still hate them. Now, we have Google’s AMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;amp-at-a-glance&quot;&gt;AMP at a glance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) as described by Google themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMP is a web component framework that you can use to easily create user-first websites, stories, emails, and ads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only it were that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original article by lucb1e (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lucb1e.com/?p=post&amp;amp;id=130&quot;&gt;Google banned from this site for foul play&lt;/a&gt;) that inspired this blog post mentions several great reasons on why &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to use AMP. I highly recommend reading that post, it’s short and straight to the point. I’m not going to breakdown every issue mentioned, but instead focus on a couple main ones that resonated with me most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AMP code is hosted by Google&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is an instant red flag for privacy and the concept of this web component being “open source”. Another example of Google taking away more control from users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google implements more prominent placement of websites using AMP compared to those not&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yeah, this doesn’t seem slanted in Google’s favor &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. Your competitors AMP site could actually be slower and less performant than your non-AMP site - but they can still potentially rank higher than you. Absolute insanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your domain is not displayed anymore when a user clicks on your results: everything goes through Google&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More power tripping and stealing away user control. I run &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; website. I own &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; domain. I create &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; own content. How is it acceptable for Google to run everything through their system that they are essentially &lt;em&gt;forcing&lt;/em&gt; me to use if I want good placement in their search results? People’s hands are tied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the default attitude of most users is to assume defeat when challenging a powerhouse like Google. It might seem like an uphill battle, but every tiny step away from them helps. We as independent web users and developers can make a small difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-block-google-from-crawling-your-websites-1&quot;&gt;1. Block Google from crawling your websites &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great point made by lucb1e at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucb1e.com/?p=post&amp;amp;id=130&quot;&gt;his blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore encourage everyone else with personal, non-profit websites to implement this [blocking Google]. As fewer results of such not-for-profit websites show up in Google Search, competition will be reintroduced to the search market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel inspired to do the same, simply add the following to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; of your pages to stop Google from crawling your website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;googlebot&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;noindex&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionally, you can look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/restricting-bots/how-to-stop-search-engines-from-crawling-your-website&quot;&gt;adding a robots.txt file to your website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-use-a-different-search-engine&quot;&gt;2. Use a different search engine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop supporting their search if you disagree with how they implement placement of AMP sites over non-AMP. The worst thing you can do is be upset with their tactics, while at the same time giving them your time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-is-a-search-engine-not-a-gate-keeper&quot;&gt;Google is a search engine, not a gate keeper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google already has far too much impact over the open web. With AMP, they are stretching their greedy hands into the pockets of independent users and companies by essentially controlling their websites. Having an attitude of “our way or the highway” has no place on the web. That was never the intention of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bradleytaunt.com/public/images/greedy-hand.png&quot; alt=&quot;Greedy hand grabbing money&quot;/&gt; Google is championing &quot;open source&quot; and performance, while seizing control of the open web. Don't be fooled.
&lt;p&gt;Google needs to stick to being a solid search engine instead of trying to be gate keepers. I promise you in the long term this will not end well for them. I feel as though users are already becoming more proactive towards keeping their independent freedom on the web and these shady practices implemented by Google will not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take quite a while before I associate any form of “trust” with Google again. Until that day comes, I will keep blocking them from displaying my website in their search results. I prefer the web open and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; At least until they rework or remove this AMP program&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Have something to say?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bradtaunt&quot;&gt;chat with me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. That way your thoughts aren't lost forever on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;170&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before GDPR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIVACY POLICY Last modified: December 18, 2017 (view archived versions) There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains: What information we collect and why we collect it. How we use that information. The choices we offer, including how to access and update information. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us. Information we collect We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. We collect information in the following ways: Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo. Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes: Device information We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account. Log information When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes: details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. Internet protocol address. device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account. Location information When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. Unique application numbers Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Local storage We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Cookies and similar technologies We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites. Our Google Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites. Information we collect when you are signed in to Google, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your Google Account. When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your Google Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy. How we use information we collect We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads. We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo. If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. Transparency and choice People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can: Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of your account. Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard. View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also visit that page to opt out of certain Google advertising services. Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others. Control who you share information with through your Google Account. Take information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services. Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads. You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences. Information you share Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. Accessing and updating your personal information Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Information we share We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies: With your consent We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. With domain administrators If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for G Suite users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to: view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install. change your account password. suspend or terminate your account access. access or retain information stored as part of your account. receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings. Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information. For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For legal reasons We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Information security We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular: We encrypt many of our services using SSL. We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.

&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE PRIVACY POLICY When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Effective May 25, 2018 | Archived versions | Download PDF We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers &amp;amp; devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed. Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information when you use audio features Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you. Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by: GPS IP address Sensor data from your device Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to save and manage your location information in your account. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf. We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs. WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA We use data to build better services We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: Provide our services We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. Maintain &amp;amp; improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings. We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. Go to Ad Settings Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services. Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public. We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide. Go to Privacy Checkup Managing, reviewing, and updating your information When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google. We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes: Privacy controls Activity Controls Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, you can turn on Location History if you want traffic predictions for your daily commute, or you can save your YouTube Watch History to get better video suggestions.

Export your data You can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law. To delete your information, you can: Delete your content from specific Google services Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products Delete your entire Google Account Delete your information And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account. There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including: Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences. Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device. SHARING YOUR INFORMATION When you share your information Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search. When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing a song in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting. When Google shares your information We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases: With your consent We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to request a ride from a ride-sharing service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your address with that service. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information. With domain administrators If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services (like G Suite), your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE We build security into our services to protect your information All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected. We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including: We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. EXPORTING &amp;amp; DELETING YOUR INFORMATION You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. Export your data To delete your information, you can: Delete your content from specific Google services Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products Delete your entire Google Account Delete your information In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes. You can read about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems. COMPLIANCE &amp;amp; COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it. Data transfers We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly. make improvements For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone. customized search results For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web &amp;amp; App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization. personalized ads You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser.

Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information. Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps. partner with Google There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

<title>Python consumes a lot of memory – how to reduce the size of objects?</title>
<link>https://habr.com/en/post/458518/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://habr.com/en/post/458518/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A memory problem may arise when a large number of objects are active in RAM during the execution of a program, especially if there are restrictions on the total amount of available memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an overview of some methods of reducing the size of objects, which can significantly reduce the amount of RAM needed for programs in pure Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is english version of my original &lt;a href=&quot;https://habr.com/ru/post/455722/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; (in russian).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, we will consider structures in Python to represent points with the coordinates &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; with access to the coordinate values by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;dict&quot;&gt;Dict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In small programs, especially in scripts, it is quite simple and convenient to use the built-in &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; to represent structural information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = {'x':1, 'y':2, 'z':3}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = ob['x']
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob['y'] = y&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of a more compact implementation in Python 3.6 with an ordered set of keys, &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; has become even more attractive. However, let's look at the size of its footprint in RAM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob))
240&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of memory, especially if you suddenly need to create a large number of instances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;class-instance&quot;&gt;Class instance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who like to clothe everything in classes, it is preferable to define structures as a class with access by attribute name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;class Point:
    #
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = Point(1,2,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = ob.x
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob.y = y&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the class instance is interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;__weakref__&lt;/code&gt; is a reference to the list of so-called weak references to this object, the field&lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; is a reference to the class instance dictionary, which contains the values of instance attributes (note that 64-bit references platform occupy 8 bytes). Starting in Python 3.3, the shared space is used to store keys in the dictionary for all instances of the class. This reduces the size of the instance trace in RAM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob), sys.getsizeof(ob.__dict__)) 
56 112&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a large number of class instances have a smaller footprint in memory than a regular dictionary (&lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that the size of the instance in RAM is still large due to the size of the dictionary of the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-of-class-with--__slots__&quot;&gt;Instance of class with __slots__&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant reduction in the size of a class instance in RAM is achieved by eliminating &lt;code&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; and&lt;code&gt;__weakref__&lt;/code&gt;. This is possible with the help of a &quot;trick&quot; with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;class Point:
    __slots__ = 'x', 'y', 'z'

    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = Point(1,2,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob))
64&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object size in RAM has become significantly smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt; in the class definition causes the footprint of a large number of instances in memory to be significantly reduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, this is the main method of substantially reducing the memory footprint of an instance of a class in RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reduction is achieved by the fact that in the memory after the title of the object, object references are stored — the attribute values, and access to them is carried out using special descriptors that are in the class dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; pprint(Point.__dict__)
mappingproxy(
              ....................................
              'x': &amp;lt;member 'x' of 'Point' objects&amp;gt;,
              'y': &amp;lt;member 'y' of 'Point' objects&amp;gt;,
              'z': &amp;lt;member 'z' of 'Point' objects&amp;gt;})&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automate the process of creating a class with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;, there is a library [namedlist] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/namedlist&quot;&gt;https://pypi.org/project/namedlist&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;namedlist.namedlist&lt;/code&gt; function creates a class with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point = namedlist('Point', ('x', 'y', 'z'))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another package [attrs] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/attrs&quot;&gt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs&lt;/a&gt;) allows you to automate the process of creating classes both with and without &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuple&quot;&gt;Tuple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python also has a built-in type &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; for representing immutable data structures. A tuple is a fixed structure or record, but without field names. For field access, the field index is used. The tuple fields are once and for all associated with the value objects at the time of creating the tuple instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = (1,2,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = ob[0]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob[1] = y # ERROR&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances of tuple are quite compact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob))
72&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They occupy 8 bytes in memory more than instances of classes with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;, since the tuple trace in memory also contains a number of fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;namedtuple&quot;&gt;Namedtuple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tuple is used very widely, one day there was a request that you could still have access to the fields and by name too. The answer to this request was the module &lt;code&gt;collections.namedtuple&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt; function is designed to automate the process of generating such classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point = namedtuple('Point', ('x', 'y', 'z'))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It creates a subclass of tuple, in which descriptors are defined for accessing fields by name. For our example, it would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt; class Point(tuple):
     #
     @property
     def _get_x(self):
         return self[0]
     @property
     def _get_y(self):
         return self[1]
     @property
     def _get_y(self):
         return self[2]
     #
     def __new__(cls, x, y, z):
         return tuple.__new__(cls, (x, y, z))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All instances of such classes have a memory footprint identical to that of a tuple. A large number of instances leave a slightly larger memory footprint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;recordclass-mutable-namedtuple-without-cyclic-gc&quot;&gt;Recordclass: mutable namedtuple without cyclic GC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; and, accordingly, &lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt;-classes generate non-mutilated objects in the sense that the object value of &lt;code&gt;ob.x&lt;/code&gt; can no longer be associated with another value object, a request for a mutable namedtuple variant has arisen. Since there is no built-in type in Python that is identical to the tuple that supports assignments, many options have been created. We will focus on [recordclass] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/recordclass&quot;&gt;https://pypi.org/project/recordclass&lt;/a&gt;), which received a rating of [stackoverflow] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29290359/existence-of-mutable-named-tuple-in&quot;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29290359/existence-of-mutable-named-tuple-in&lt;/a&gt; -python / 29419745). In additioobjects liken, it can be used to reduce the size of objects in RAM compared to the size of &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt;-like objects..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package &lt;strong&gt;recordclass&lt;/strong&gt; introduces the type &lt;code&gt;recordclass.mutabletuple&lt;/code&gt;, which is almost identical to the tuple, but also supports assignments. On its basis, subclasses are created that are almost completely identical to namedtuples, but also support the assignment of new values to fields (without creating new instances). The &lt;code&gt;recordclass&lt;/code&gt; function, like the&lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt; function, allows you to automate the creation of these classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point = recordclass('Point', ('x', 'y', 'z'))
 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = Point(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class instances have same structure as &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt;, but only without&lt;code&gt;PyGC_Head&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the &lt;code&gt;recordclass&lt;/code&gt; function create a class that does not participate in the cyclic garbage collection mechanism. Typically, &lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt; and&lt;code&gt;recordclass&lt;/code&gt; are used to generate classes representing records or simple (non-recursive) data structures. Using them correctly in Python does not generate circular references. For this reason, in the wake of instances of classes generated by &lt;code&gt;recordclass&lt;/code&gt;, by &lt;code&gt;default, the&lt;/code&gt;PyGC_Head&lt;code&gt;fragment is excluded, which is necessary for classes supporting the cyclic garbage collection mechanism (more precisely: in the&lt;/code&gt;PyTypeObject&lt;code&gt;structure, corresponding to the created class, in the&lt;/code&gt;flags&lt;code&gt;field, by default, the flag&lt;/code&gt;Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` is not set).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the memory footprint of a large number of instances is smaller than that of instances of the class with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;dataobject&quot;&gt;Dataobject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution proposed in the recordclass library is based on the idea: use the same storage structure in memory as in class instances with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;, but do not participate in the cyclic garbage collection mechanism. Such classes are generated using the &lt;code&gt;recordclass.make_dataclass&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point = make_dataclass('Point', ('x', 'y', 'z'))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class created in this way, by default, creates mutable instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way – use class declaration with inheritance from &lt;code&gt;recordclass.dataobject&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;class Point(dataobject):
    x:int
    y:int
    z:int&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes created in this way will create instances that do not participate in the circlic garbage collection mechanism. The structure of the instance in memory is the same as in the case with &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt;, but without the &lt;code&gt;PyGC_Head&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = Point(1,2,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob))
40&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the fields, special descriptors are also used to access the field by its offset from the beginning of the object, which are located in the class dictionary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;mappingproxy({'__new__': &amp;lt;staticmethod at 0x7f203c4e6be0&amp;gt;,
              .......................................
              'x': &amp;lt;recordclass.dataobject.dataslotgetset at 0x7f203c55c690&amp;gt;,
              'y': &amp;lt;recordclass.dataobject.dataslotgetset at 0x7f203c55c670&amp;gt;,
              'z': &amp;lt;recordclass.dataobject.dataslotgetset at 0x7f203c55c410&amp;gt;})&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sizeo of the memory footprint of a large number of instances is the minimum possible for CPython:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;cython&quot;&gt;Cython&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one approach based on the use of [Cython] (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cython.org&quot;&gt;https://cython.org&lt;/a&gt;). Its advantage is that the fields can take on the values of the C language atomic types. Descriptors for accessing fields from pure Python are created automatically. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;cdef class Python:
    cdef public int x, y, z

 def __init__(self, x, y, z):
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
      self.z = z&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the instances have an even smaller memory size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ob = Point(1,2,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(sys.getsizeof(ob))
32&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instance trace in memory has the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the footprint of a large number of copies is less:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it should be remembered that when accessing from Python code, a conversion from &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; to a Python object and vice versa will be performed every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;numpy&quot;&gt;Numpy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using multidimensional arrays or arrays of records for a large amount of data gives a gain in memory. However, for efficient processing in pure Python, you should use processing methods that focus on the use of functions from the &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point = numpy.dtype(('x', numpy.int32), ('y', numpy.int32), ('z', numpy.int32)])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An array of &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; elements, initialized with zeros, is created using the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; points = numpy.zeros(N, dtype=Point)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the array in memory is the minimum possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal access to array elements and rows will require convertion from a Python object to a C &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; value and vice versa. Extracting a single row results in the creation of an array containing a single element. Its trace will not be so compact anymore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;plaintext&quot;&gt;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sys.getsizeof(points[0])
  68&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
