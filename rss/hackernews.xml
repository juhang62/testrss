<title>Advice to my young self: forget side projects and focus on your job</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been suspicious of the idea of being attached to a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be because of the leftist spirit of my generation in France, or because of my readings during my student years, or because of my familial history (which saw way more self-employed, farmers, nurses or teachers than company employees), but I’ve never accepted the idea of giving even a tiny portion of my independence of mind to a company. When I was a student, I wasn’t dreaming about joining a company like Google, who seemed too sectarian to me, to rather prefer boring companies, where we only expect you to work well. Keeping a distance from my company was, I thought, the way to stay &lt;em&gt;who I am&lt;/em&gt;, without being infected by an external force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean that I didn’t care about my job. I’ve always been involved in my work, being proactive in bringing new technologies, mentoring the other developers, helping the team to grow, but I was doing this just because I liked my job. I was not considering this as something important in my career, simply because I didn’t want too. To develop my career, I was spending a lot of time outside work reading technical books, doing toy projects, going to meetups, browsing Hacker News. I was finding here what my company was fundamentally unable to give me, and I was feeling holding my fate in my own hands. I thought it was the best recipe to end with a successful career, while remaining free and protected from the meanders of corporate culture (or corporate politics, actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, most recruiters don’t care about your personal projects or how many meetups you went during the year. What matters the most is your current company - and by that I mean the name of your current company. It was saddening me before, but now that I’m on the other side today, with a manager position, I better understand this. This is plain common sense. You can generally assume that a developer coming from a cutting-edge company has better chances to be a great developer than a developer coming from a Java 1.4 shop. He may not be smarter, but he has been hired by a company with a most demanding hiring process, and has been surrounded by some of the smartest developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, having too many personal projects can raise a flag and be scary for the recruiter. When my entrepreneurial experience has been over, I was disappointed and somewhat regretful of some of our choices, but generally proud of everything we did and excited to share my story to recruiters. I was surprised to see that most of them were only asking questions about my previous experiences as an employee. My CTO experience was an anomaly, at best two lost years, at worst a sign that I was too independent, too individualistic, not a good team player. Only relatively small and ambitious startups, like the one I’m in today, were valuing this experience.&lt;br/&gt;Today, I recommend not hiding your side projects, but to not displaying them as a primary part of your identity, to not scare the recruiter and let him feel that you have a secondary plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I don’t think that multiplying the side projects is useful unless they are substantial. Side projects that we consider futile, that we do just to get away from our daily work, don’t make us better in our job. The things that make us progress are the issues we want to avoid and that generally come only when your toy project has been transformed into a product and when you have to deal with users, production issues, and money (your money). Basically, all the things that no one wants to do on his free time. Even from a purely technical point of view, you will not really understand a library or a framework by just sticking to the tutorial or its basic features. You’ll have to dig into and to face its most painful aspects to deeply understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shallow side projects are useful to develop a first opinion about a technology that will need to be confirmed with a more elaborate project. I’d compare them to school.&lt;br/&gt;When I was a teenager, I remember what we were saying about it: &lt;em&gt;it will never help us in our future job&lt;/em&gt;. After all, how teachings about antiderivatives, Rimbaud’s poetry or Napoleonic wars could be useful for our future adult life? We were right. Most of what we learned is pretty useless today, whether you are a cook, a hairdresser or a developer.&lt;br/&gt;But this formed a complete package that infuses our adult life. Junior school is great because you don’t learn to find a job. You’re at school to grow as a citizen, not to prepare to your future life, and actually you’re better not to think about your future if you don’t want to question yourself about the meaning of your existence. This is the same thing for side projects. See them as a way to discover a new topic and enlarge your horizon, not as something that you could action in your current position or to find a new job. Otherwise, you expose yourself to severe disillusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to dig a new technology is to practice it in your daily job. You’ll spend seven hours a day on it and will quickly become infinitely more proficient than if you just barely used it on nights and weekends. You may tell me that we face a chicken or egg problem here. How to get a job where you’ll work on a really attractive technology if you never used it before? Well, instead of spending nights superficially learning this technology, spend your nights preparing interviews. Read “Cracking the code interview”, learn everything you need to know about algorithms and binary trees. As we all know, the interview process is broken. Instead of deploring it, take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to make this blog post a rant against side projects. In fact, I’m advocating the exact opposite. Continue to do as many side projects as ever, code on nights and weekends if you want too, but don’t think about how they could be useful to you to get a new job. Don’t do all the tutorials you find about Vue.js, but use this weird technology that you saw yesterday on Hacker News. Don’t think about what are the best blog post topics that could expand your personal branding, but write poetry or a review of the last movie you saw. Create the apps, services, websites, or video games you want to use. This may not make your portfolio or your public image convincing for the next recruiter you’ll meet, but this is how you will be able to express all that you have in you and end up affirming yourself. At least, you should end having something meaningful to show, something to be proud about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to feel free and have time for your projects? Focus your efforts on joining a great company. This will make your career considerably easier and will make you as free as you wanted to be initially. The link you’ll develop with your company will be a source of discomfort sometimes, but it will protect you from the never-ending competition on the job market. The satisfaction of seeing your career flourishing without you having to do anything will give you a valuable peace of mind.&lt;br/&gt;By trading a little bit of what you think is your independence, you’ll get the real one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Harvard, Oxford, Stanford doctors among leaders of global anti-lockdown movement</title>
<link>https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/12/coronavirus-stanford-doctors-among-leaders-of-global-anti-lockdown-movement/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/12/coronavirus-stanford-doctors-among-leaders-of-global-anti-lockdown-movement/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Stanford University are at the forefront of a global movement of health experts who are criticizing lockdowns to control COVID-19 and say schools and businesses should reopen, but with a focus on protecting the elderly and infirm who are most vulnerable to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gbdeclaration.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Great Barrington Declaration&lt;/a&gt; after the western Massachusetts town where it was hatched this month at an economic policy think tank, their statement of purpose is the handiwork of three principal drafters who include Stanford medical professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists, we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies,” the declaration states. “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the arguments are not new, with more than 18,000 medical, science and public health practitioners among its more than 191,000 worldwide online signatories, it represents the largest public break among health experts from their peers’ prevailing support for lockdowns since the pandemic began early this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the declaration has drawn fire from other doctors and public health officials who say lifting lockdowns will only invite a new wave of COVID-19 infections and fatalities from the deadly virus. More than 7.6 million people in the United States have contracted the virus, and 213,000 people have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whose grandmother and grandfather and family members are you willing to sacrifice for this stupid idea?” asked Santa Clara County Executive Jeff Smith, whose administration in March led the Bay Area in imposing the first U.S. lockdown in the pandemic and has since been criticized since for its slow pace of reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazyautosizes lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;4583&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SJM-L-VIRUSTHURS-0918-6.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w&quot;/&gt;Dr. Jeff Smith, executive officer of Santa Clara County, speaks at an event, Thursday, Sept. 17, 2020, promoting the county’s new flu vaccine program at the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds in San Jose. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)
&lt;p&gt;The declaration’s signers are clearly frustrated with the dominant public health orthodoxy that indefinite and costly shutdowns are needed to keep the virus in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A number of scientists and non-scientists alike tried to raise questions about both the effectiveness and the potential harms of the lockdowns as long ago as March,” said Laura Lazzeroni, a Stanford professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences specializing in biomedical data science, who also signed the declaration. “But honest and investigative scientific discussion has been difficult to achieve this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Dr. Rajiv Bhatia, a practicing physician, affiliated assistant professor of medicine at Stanford and former deputy health officer for San Francisco, who also signed the declaration, blames politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump, who has seen his administration’s economic gains and his re-election prospects upended by lockdowns, has urged reopening and questioned the evolving science around the virus, which he recently contracted and is recovering from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you raise a critical perspective, people associate you with Trump,” Bhatia said. “It’s hard for even me to speak to colleagues about this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot; lazyautosizes lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; width=&quot;706&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1282-e1591743863413.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w&quot;/&gt;Rajiv Bhatia is a practicing physician and an affiliated assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University. He was a deputy health officer for San Francisco from 1998-2014. (Photo courtesy of Rajiv Bhatia)
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya, who drafted the declaration with doctors Martin Kulldorff, a Harvard University medical professor, and Sunetra Gupta, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, has been at the center of the lockdown controversy from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, he co-authored a Wall Street Journal opinion column suggesting the new coronavirus may not be as deadly as many believe. The following month, he co-authored a Stanford study that indicated the virus was far more prevalent than presumed and as a result, the death rate far lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pre-peer-review study — which was later revised — drew withering criticism and even prompted Stanford to review the team’s work, which Bhattacharya said he was confident would be vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya, who was not available for comment, and the co-signers argue lockdowns haven’t been properly weighed against the ensuing harm. Not only has there been lost livelihoods and learning for workers and students, but the lockdowns have caused harm to their mental and physical health from prolonged isolation, lack of exercise and avoidance of routine vaccinations, medical checkups and other procedures, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulette Altmaier, a former Cisco Systems vice president and philanthropist who criticized Santa Clara County’s slow reopening in a full-page newspaper ad in May, found it refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Science is about learning from new data and vigorous debate,” Altmaier said. “Instead, for the first time, we have had people claiming to be ‘following the science and the data’ who are in fact merely imposing their opinions on us by fiat, with catastrophic consequences for children’s education and people’s livelihoods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Smith, who has a medical degree, and other health experts say the approach called for in the declaration hasn’t worked so well in countries that have taken it, such as Brazil and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Brazil has the world’s fifth-highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;per-capita COVID-19 fatality rate&lt;/a&gt;, according to Johns Hopkins University, though it is lower than that of Peru, which has the second-highest rate despite having had one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns. Sweden’s fatality rate is much higher than neighboring Norway, Finland, Denmark and Germany, though lower than that in the U.S., United Kingdom and Italy.
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of communities around the world that have tried to take the approach of ‘let it spread and we’ll do minimal separation and social distancing’ and have seen bad outcomes,” Smith said. He argues that the restrictions are needed to protect the vulnerable because the virus can be spread by people who don’t know they’re infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts like Dr. George Rutherford at UC San Francisco say the country is nowhere near reaching “herd immunity,” and loosening restrictions will only mean many more will have to get infected and die to reach that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It hinges on how many deaths we are going to tolerate before we get to a level of herd immunity where we stop transmission,” Rutherford said. “I have to come down on the side of preventing mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A little backstory: It's happened to me twice in recent times when I would have a conversation with a friend about a product via text or phone call, and lo and behold! The next day my Instagram and Reddit had ads for that thing. This convinced me that my cell phone carrier, AT&amp;amp;T, is selling my private info to marketers. Luckily, we can opt out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;EDIT: Apparently a lot of people are having the &quot;Our system doesn't seem to be cooperating. Sorry for any inconvenience. Please try again later&quot; message when trying to unsubscribe. I think AT&amp;amp;T may have discovered this thread. Set a reminder in your phone for another time, and come back and try again, or talk to a representative over the phone and record the call, then email them to confirm your opt-out status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Note: opting out seems to be only available in California, U.S. If you want your state to force corporations to allow you to opt out, email or call your lawmakers!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Removing Holocaust Denial Content</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/removing-holocaust-denial-content/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content uk-width-4-5@m uk-width-1-1@s&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we are updating our hate speech policy to prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizations that study trends in hate speech are reporting increases in online attacks against many groups worldwide, and we continue our efforts to remove it. We have banned more than 250 white supremacist organizations and updated our policies to address militia groups and QAnon. We also routinely ban other individuals and organizations globally, and we took down 22.5 million pieces of hate speech from our platform in the second quarter of this year. Following a year of consultation with external experts, we recently banned anti-Semitic stereotypes about the collective power of Jews that often depicts them running the world or its major institutions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today’s announcement marks another step in our effort to fight hate on our services. Our decision is supported by the well-documented rise in anti-Semitism globally and the alarming level of ignorance about the Holocaust, especially among young people. According to a recent survey of adults in the US aged 18-39, almost a quarter said they believed the Holocaust was a myth, that it had been exaggerated or they weren’t sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Institutions focused on Holocaust research and remembrance, such as Yad Vashem, have noted that Holocaust education is also a key component in combatting anti-Semitism. Beginning later this year, we will direct anyone to credible information off Facebook if they search for terms associated with the Holocaust or its denial on our platform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For many years, we have worked with communities around the world to help us understand how hatred, including anti-Semitism, is expressed online. These efforts have included regular discussions with groups that have a global reach, like the World Jewish Congress and the American Jewish Committee, as well as organizations focused on protecting local Jewish communities such as Community Security Trust in the UK. We’ve also worked with institutions and groups that combat hate and anti-Semitism such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight. There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement. We are grateful to many partners for their input and candor as we work to keep our platform safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>I Tried to Reduce Pylint Memory Usage</title>
<link>https://rtpg.co/2020/10/12/pylint-usage.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rtpg.co/2020/10/12/pylint-usage.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Through work I have to deal with a pretty huge codebase, and run Pylint on it during our continuous integration process. It's always been a bit slow, but recently I also noticed that it was consuming a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of memory, causing OOM failures if we tried to run it too much in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to roll up my sleeves and figure out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What exactly was consuming so much memory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to avoid doing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a log of how I went about these two questions, as future reference for when I do other profiling work in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Pylint from the entrypoint(&lt;code&gt;pylint/__main__.py&lt;/code&gt;), I end up digging downwards and finding the &quot;quintessential&quot; &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop that you would expect in a program that checks a bunch of files for errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    def _check_files(self, get_ast, file_descrs):
            # in pylint/lint/pylinter.py
            with self._astroid_module_checker() as check_astroid_module:
                for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
                    self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I just threw in a &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;HI&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; statement in there to confirm that this is indeed what's being run when I do &lt;code&gt;pylint my_code&lt;/code&gt;, and that goes off without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is to try and figure out what's being held in memory, so I do a really basic &quot;heap dump&quot; with heapy to see if anything stands out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;        from guppy import hpy
        hp = hpy()
        i = 0
        for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
            self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
            i += 1
            if i % 10 == 0:
                print(&quot;HEAP&quot;)
                print(hp.heap())
            if i == 100:
                raise ValueError(&quot;Done&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heap profiles end up being almost entirely &quot;frame types&quot; (which I was kind of expecting, for some reason), but also holding ont a bunch of tracebacks. Enough of these kinds of objects that I told myself &quot;surely this is more than is needed&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    Partition of a set of 2751394 objects. Total size = 436618350 bytes.
    Index  Count   %     Size   % Cumulative  % Kind (class / dict of class)
        0 429084  16 220007072  50 220007072  50 types.FrameType
        1 535810  19 30005360   7 250012432  57 types.TracebackType
        2 516282  19 29719488   7 279731920  64 tuple
        3 101904   4 29004928   7 308736848  71 set
        4 185568   7 21556360   5 330293208  76 dict (no owner)
        5 206170   7 16304240   4 346597448  79 list
        6 117531   4  9998322   2 356595770  82 str
        7  38582   1  9661040   2 366256810  84 dict of astroid.node_classes.Name
        8  76755   3  6754440   2 373011250  85 tokenize.TokenInfo
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's at this point that I discovered heapy's &lt;a href=&quot;https://zhuyifei1999.github.io/guppy3/pbscreen.jpg&quot;&gt;Profile Browser&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed like a bit of a nicer way to look at this data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched up the heap mechanism to dump to a file every 10 iterations, then graph the entire runtime behaviour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
        self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
        i += 1
        if i % 10 == 0:
            hp.heap().stat.dump(&quot;/tmp/linting.stats&quot;)
        if i == 100:
            hp.pb(&quot;/tmp/linting.stats&quot;)
            raise ValueError(&quot;Done&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the following result, confirming that frames and tracebacks are a big deal in this run of Pylint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step is to actually look at the frame objects. Because Python is reference coutned, things are held in memory because &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is pointing at them, so I'm going to try and find out which one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful &lt;code&gt;objgraph&lt;/code&gt; library takes advantage of the Python memory manager to let you look at all objects still in memory, as well as lookup references to an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's actually very amazing that you can do this. Just have an object reference and you can find everything &lt;em&gt;pointing towards&lt;/em&gt; that reference (there's some asterisks around C extensions but close enough). This is just wonderful technology for debugging, and another thing that makes Python a joy to work with, thanks to how much of CPython's internals are exposed for these kinds of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I struggled to find objects because &lt;code&gt;objgraph.by_type('types.TracebackType')&lt;/code&gt; wasn't finding any objects, despite me having records of having half a million of them. Turns out the name to use was &lt;code&gt;traceback&lt;/code&gt;. Didn't quite nail down why...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gives me a &quot;random traceback&quot;. &lt;code&gt;objgraph.show_backrefs&lt;/code&gt; will draw a graph of objects referencing this traceback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put an &lt;code&gt;import pdb; pdb.set_trace()&lt;/code&gt; into the for loop after 100 iterations instead of just raising an exception, and I started looking at random tracebacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def exclude(obj):
    return 'Pdb' in str(type(obj))

def f(depth=7):
    objgraph.show_backrefs([random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))],
                            max_depth=depth,
                            filter=lambda elt: not exclude(elt))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I was just seeing a chain of tracebacks, so I went for a depth of 100 and....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-stack.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-stack.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So a bunch of tracebacks referencing other tracebacks. Cool. So many of them were like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up just trying a bunch and failing, so I went after a secondary target: the &lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt; types. These also seemed suspicious to me, and whatI end up finding is something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tracebacks are holding onto frames (hence some similar cardinality). It's all a big mess, but the frames were at least pointing to lines of code. And this made me realize something silly: &lt;em&gt;I had never bothered to actually look at the data using up so much memory&lt;/em&gt;. I totally should have just looked at the traceback objects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this I ended up doing this in the most convoluted way possible, which is look at the addresses in the &lt;code&gt;objgraph&lt;/code&gt; image dump, seeing the memory addresses, searching the web for &quot;how do I get a Python object from its address&quot; and ending up finding the neat trick that I had noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ipdb&amp;gt; import ctypes
ipdb&amp;gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object)
py_object(&amp;lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&amp;gt;)
ipdb&amp;gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
&amp;lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&amp;gt;
ipdb&amp;gt; my_tb = ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
ipdb&amp;gt; traceback.print_tb(my_tb, limit=20)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just tell Python &quot;hey look at this memory, it's definitely at least a python object&quot; and it will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I realized I had references to these objects through &lt;code&gt;objgraph&lt;/code&gt; and could just use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like Astroid is building up tracebacks through exception handling code a bit all over the place. I feel like most &quot;cool tricks&quot; are gotten to by forgetting about the easy way to do something, so I won't complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traceback itself had a bunch of lines going through Astroid, the AST parser backing Pylint. Progress! Astroid does seem like a program that might hold onto a lot of stuff in memory as its parsing files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look around and end up seeing the following line in &lt;code&gt;astroid/manager.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;except Exception as ex:
    raise exceptions.AstroidImportError(
    &quot;Loading {modname} failed with:\n{error}&quot;,
    modname=modname,
    path=found_spec.location,
) from ex
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aha!&quot; Itell myself. This is what I'm lookign for! Some sort of exception chain that would generate super long tracebacks. Plus it's file parsing so there's reccursion, etc... &lt;code&gt;raise thing from other_thing&lt;/code&gt; would chain them together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remove this &lt;code&gt;from ex&lt;/code&gt; and .... nothing. Memory usage is still basically the same, and the tracebacks are still here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that exceptions hold their local bindings in the tracebacks, so the &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt; is still accessible. It can't be garbage colleceted just yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a bunch of refactorings to try and remove the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; block for the most part, at least to avoid the reference to &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;. Again, nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the life of me I can't get these tracebacks to garbage collect, despite there being no references to them. At least I thought this was the remaining reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really though, this was all a red herring. I don't know if this actually had anything to do with my memory leak, because at one point I started noticing that &lt;strong&gt;I had no evidence&lt;/strong&gt; backing up this entire exception chaining theory. Just a bunch of hunches, plus half a million tracebacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started just kind of randomly looking at tracebacks looking for any extra clues. I tried going up the chain of references by hand but was getting nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had the revelation: these tracebacks are all stacked on top of each other, but there will be a traceback that is above all these other ones. There is a traceback that doesn't just have another traceback pointing to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the references were through the &lt;code&gt;tb_next&lt;/code&gt; property, as a simple chain. So I decided to look for the tracebacks at the end of their respective chains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bottom_tbs = [tb for tb in objgraph.by_type('traceback') if tb.tb_next is None]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something magical about one-lining your way through 500,000 stack traces to find the one you actually care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to what I was actually looking for: the reason why Python really wanted to keep these objects around in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We had a file cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Astroid will cache the results of loading a module, so that if some part of the code asks for the same module/file again, it can just provide the previous result. It will also reproduce the errors as well, by holding onto thrown exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I made a bit of a judgement call. Caching the &quot;error-ness&quot; makes sense, but for me it's not at all worth holding onto the number of tracebacks our code is generating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to throw away the exception, store a custom &lt;code&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt; class, and then just re-building exceptions when they are asked for. The details can be found over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/pull/837&quot;&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt;, though it's not super interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result: we went from 500MB memory usage to 100MB for the codebase I was working against&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/bp-post-fix.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/bp-post-fix.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 80% improvement's not bad, if I do say so myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR itself, I'm not sure if it will actually get merged though. It's not purely a performance change, and I think it could make stack traces less useful in some scenarios. It's a pretty brutal change all things considered, even if the test suite still passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overally, I came away with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The memory visibility in Python is pretty amazing, and I should be using it more often when debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back up the theories with evidence, not just hunches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the &quot;current objectives&quot; so you don't completely lose the plot while debugging. This took me a couple hours in the end and I went down way too many rabbit holes that were not realated to my actual issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving your WIP snippets (or even better: committing to Git) is super useful. It might be tempting to just delete stuff, but you might need to look up how you got a result later on, especially for more performance-oriented work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that made me smile though; while writing this retrospective, I realized I had already forgotten so much of how I got to certain conclusions, so ended up re-testing some of my snippets. I then ran my measurements on an unrelated codebase and found that &lt;strong&gt;the weird memory usage only happened on one codebase&lt;/strong&gt;. I had spent a bunch of time debugging this issue, but it's extremely likely that it's just pathological behaviour that's hitting only a minority of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when you do all these measurements, it's always very hard to make blanket statements about performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be trying to take this experience to other projects as well. My theory is that there's a lot of low hanging fruit in performance-related questions for open-source Python projects, given that the community has relatively little focus on that space (beyond the &quot;libraries that are just C extensions&quot; class of projects).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloudflare One</title>
<link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-one/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-one/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image2-8.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we’re announcing Cloudflare One™. It is the culmination of engineering and technical development guided by conversations with thousands of customers about the future of the corporate network. It provides secure, fast, reliable, cost-effective network services, integrated with leading identity management and endpoint security providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this week, we'll be rolling out the components that enable Cloudflare One, including our WARP Gateway Clients for desktop and mobile, our Access for SaaS solution, our browser isolation product, and our next generation network firewall and intrusion detection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old model of the corporate network has been made obsolete by mobile, SaaS, and the public cloud. The events of 2020 have only accelerated the need for a new model. Zero Trust networking is the future and we are proud to be enabling that future. Having worked on the components of what is Cloudflare One for the last two years, we’re excited to unveil today how they’ve come together into a robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/&quot;&gt;SASE&lt;/a&gt; solution and share how customers are already using it to deliver the more secure and productive future of the corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cloudflare-one-secure-optimized-global-networking&quot;&gt;What Is Cloudflare One? Secure, Optimized Global Networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One is a comprehensive, cloud-based network-as-a-service solution that is designed to be secure, fast, reliable and define the future of the corporate network. It replaces a patchwork of appliances and WAN technologies with a single network that provides cloud-based security, performance, and control through one user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One brings together how users connect, on-ramps for branch offices, secure connectivity for applications, and controlled access to SaaS, into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One reflects the complex nature of corporate networking today: mobile and remote users, SaaS applications, a mix of applications hosted in private data centers and public cloud, as well the challenge of employees using the broader Internet securely from their corporate and personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image8-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you call this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/&quot;&gt;SASE&lt;/a&gt; or simply the new reality, today’s enterprise needs flexibility at every layer of the network and application stack. Secure and authenticated access is needed for users wherever they are: at the office, on a mobile device or working from home. Corporate network architectures need to reflect the state of modern computing that requires secure, filtered Internet access to get to SaaS or public cloud, secure application connectivity to protect against hackers and DDoS, and fast, reliable branch and home office access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the new corporate network needs to be global. No matter where applications are hosted, or employees reside, connectivity needs to be secure and fast. With Cloudflare’s massive global presence, traffic is secured, routed, and filtered over an optimized backbone that uses real time Internet intelligence to protect against the latest threats and route traffic around bad Internet weather and outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you’re only as strong as your weakest link. It doesn’t matter how secure your network is if you allow the wrong people access, or your end user’s devices are compromised. That is why we’re incredibly excited to announce that Cloudflare One takes the power of Cloudflare’s network and combines it with best-of-breed identity management and device integrity to create a complete solution that encompasses the entire corporate network of today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;partner-ecosystem-identity-management&quot;&gt;Partner ecosystem: Identity Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations already have one or more identity management systems. Rather than requiring them to change, we are integrating with all the major providers. This week we're announcing partnerships with Okta, Ping Identity, and OneLogin. We support nearly all the other leading identity providers including Microsoft Active Directory and Google Workspace, as well as broadly adopted consumer and developer identity platforms like Github, LinkedIn, and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image11-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerfully, Cloudflare One does not require you to standardize on just one identity provider. We see multiple companies that may have one identity provider for full-time employees and another for contractors. Or one they chose themselves and another they inherited from an acquisition. Cloudflare One will integrate with one or more identity providers and allow you to then set consistent policies across all your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metaphor that makes sense to me is that the identity provider issues passports and Cloudflare One is the border agent that checks that they're valid. At any particular moment, different passports from different providers may be allowed or forbidden to enter just by updating the instructions the border agent follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;partner-ecosystem-device-integrity&quot;&gt;Partner ecosystem: Device Integrity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to identity, device integrity and endpoint security are an important part of a zero trust solution. This week we're announcing partnerships with CrowdStrike, VMware Carbon Black, SentinelOne, and Tanium. These providers run on devices and ensure that they haven't been compromised. Again, organizations can centralize around a single vendor for device integrity or can mix and match with Cloudflare One providing a consistent control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image18-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extending the border control analogy, it's like having a temperature screening and COVID-19 test when you enter a country. Even if you have a valid passport, if you're not healthy then you will be turned away. By partnering with the leading identity and device integrity providers, Cloudflare One provides a robust identity and access management solution that fully delivers on the promise of Zero Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to partner with these leading identity management and endpoint security companies to make Cloudflare One flexible and robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this as an introduction to Cloudflare One, I wanted to provide some context on why the existing paradigm doesn’t work, what the future of the enterprise network looks like, and where we go from here. In order to understand the power of Cloudflare One, you first have to understand the way we used to build and secure corporate networks and how the transition to mobile, cloud, and remote work have all forced this fundamental change in the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-middle-box-ages-how-corporate-security-used-to-work&quot;&gt;The Middle(box) Ages: How Corporate Security Used to Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet was designed to be a massive, decentralized network. Any computer could connect to that network and route data from one location to another. The model provided resiliency, but did not guarantee fast or available connections. The early Internet also lacked a framework for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image16-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, enterprises did not trust the Internet as a platform for their businesses. To keep employees productive, network connections had to be fast and available. Those connections also had to be secure. So, businesses built their own shadow versions of the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies purchased dedicated, private connections between offices and across their data centers in the form of expensive MPLS links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT teams managed complex routing across offices, VPN hardware, and clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security teams deployed physical firewall boxes and DDoS appliances to keep the private network safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When employees had to use the Internet, security teams backhauled traffic through a central location to filter outbound connections with yet more hardware: Internet gateways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy corporate security followed a castle and moat approach. You put all your sensitive applications and data in the castle, you required all your employees to come to work in the castle every day, and then you built a metaphorical moat around the castle using firewalls, DDoS appliances, gateways and more: an unmanageable mess of devices and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-middle-box-ages-are-long-gone&quot;&gt;The Middle(box) Ages Are Long Gone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While smarter attackers finding ways to breach moats were always a concern for the castle and moat approach, ultimately they weren’t what caused the approach to fail. Instead the change came from transformation of the technical landscape. Smartphones made workers increasingly mobile, letting them venture outside the moat. SaaS and the public cloud moved data and corporate applications out of the metaphorical castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image15-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in 2020, COVID-19 changed everything by forcing everyone who could to work remotely. If the employees weren't coming to work in the castle anymore, the whole paradigm completely breaks down. This transition was happening already, but this year poured gasoline on the already smoldering fire. Increasingly companies are realizing that the only way forward is to embrace the fact that employees, servers and applications are now “on the Internet” and not “in the castle.” This new paradigm is known as “Zero Trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's seminal paper, &quot;BeyondCorp: A New Approach to Enterprise Security,&quot; published in 2014, brought the idea of Zero Trust security into the mainstream. Google's insight in 2014 was that you could solve the challenges of every employee and application being on the Internet by ensuring that every application would inherently distrust every connection. If there was zero trust inherent to what network you were on, then every user of every application would be continuously authenticated. Powerfully, that would simultaneously enhance security while enabling more use of cloud applications as well as mobile and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-lan-a-secure-wan&quot;&gt;The Future LAN: A Secure WAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we realized talking to customers was that even the analyst and competitor framing of the future corporate network didn't fully recognize some challenges that come with a Zero Trust model. One of the benefits of embracing a Zero Trust model is that it makes enabling branch and home offices easier and less expensive. Rather than having to lease expensive MPLS circuits to connect branch offices — something that is literally impossible as people work from home — you instead require every use of every application to be authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image7-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lines up with something else we’ve heard from our customers over the last six months: “maybe the Internet is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; good enough.” Like physical offices, many MPLS or SD-WAN deployments are currently sitting idle. And yet, employees continue to be productive. If users could move to a model that runs on the Internet, and one that improves the Internet, teams can stop spending money on legacy routing. Rather than trying to build more private networks, the corporate network of the future leverages the Internet but with heightened security, performance, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds great, but it opens a whole new can of worms. Inherently to do this you need to expose more of your applications to the Internet. While they may be safe from unauthorized use if you've properly implemented Zero Trust, that opens them to many less sophisticated, but highly disruptive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019 we saw a disturbing new trend begin to emerge. DDoS attackers shifted their focus from embarrassing companies by knocking their websites offline to increasingly targeting internal applications and networks. Unfortunately, we've seen more of these attacks launched throughout the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence. It's the direct result of companies being forced to expose more of their internal applications to the Internet in order to support remote work. To our surprise, it has turned out that while we anticipated Access and Gateway being the natural pairing of products, equally often customers looking to move to a Zero Trust model are bundling Cloudflare's DDoS and WAF products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense. If you are exposing more of your applications to the Internet, then the problems that Internet-facing applications have had to deal with in the past now become the problems of your internal applications as well. It's become clear to us that the future of a SASE or Zero Trust network needs to also include DDoS mitigation and WAF as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-the-internet-secure-and-reliable-enough-for-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Making the Internet Secure and Reliable Enough for the Enterprise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agree with the customers we’ve talked to who say that the Internet is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; good enough to replace a corporate network. We’ve been building products to fill in the gaps where it needs to be better. Virtual appliances in regional public cloud providers are not sufficient. Enterprises need a global, distributed network that accelerates traffic in any location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image19.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the last decade building Cloudflare’s network; bringing the Internet closer to users around the world and supporting incredible scale. According to W3Techs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all/q&quot;&gt;more than 14% of the web&lt;/a&gt; already relies on our network. We can also use that to constantly measure the Internet at scale and find faster routes. That scale allows us to deliver Cloudflare One to any organization, no matter where they are located or how global their workforce, and ensure their network and applications are secure, fast, and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;foreshadowing-cloudflare-one&quot;&gt;Foreshadowing Cloudflare One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same lessons we’ve learned handling traffic for the websites on our network can be applied to how enterprises connect to everything else. We started that journey last year when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/&quot;&gt;launched Cloudflare WARP&lt;/a&gt;, a consumer product that routes all connections leaving a personal device through Cloudflare’s network, where we can encrypt and accelerate it. This week, we’ll show how the WARP Client is now one of the on-ramps to get employee traffic onto Cloudflare One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image9-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We launched WARP on mobile devices because we knew they would prove to be the most difficult to get right. Traditionally, VPN clients are clunky battery sucks designed for desktops and, if they have mobile versions at all, they’ve been clumsily ported over. We set out to build WARP to work great on mobile, not burning battery life or slowing connections down, because we knew if we could pull that off then it would be easy to port it to the less limited constraints of the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also launched it for consumers first because they are the best QA team you could ever assemble. More than 10 million consumers have been putting WARP through its paces for the last year. We’ve seen edge cases from every corner of the Internet and used them to iron the bugs out. We knew that if we could make the WARP Client something that consumers loved to use then it would be a stark contrast to every other enterprise solution in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we built products to deliver the same improvements to data centers and offices. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Magic Transit last year to provide secure, performant, and reliable IP connectivity to the Internet. Earlier this year, we expanded that model when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-interconnect/&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI) to allow our customers to interconnect branch offices and data centers directly with Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Access starts by introducing identity into Cloudflare’s network. We apply filters based on identity and context to both inbound and outbound connections. Every login, request, and response proxies through Cloudflare’s network regardless of the location of the server or user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Gateway keeps connections to the rest of the Internet safe. By routing all traffic through Cloudflare’s network first, customers can deprecrate on-premise firewalls eliminating Internet backhaul requirements that slow down users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image10-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;pulling-the-pieces-together&quot;&gt;Pulling the Pieces Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think about the products in Cloudflare One in two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-ramps&lt;/strong&gt;: the products that connect a user, device, or location to Cloudflare’s edge. WARP for endpoints, Magic Transit and CNI for networks, Argo Smart Routing to accelerate traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filters&lt;/strong&gt;: the products that shield networks from attacks, inspect traffic for threats, and apply least privilege rules to data and applications. Access for Zero Trust rules, Gateway for traffic filtering, Magic Firewall for network filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most competitors in this space focus on one area, which loses out on the efficiencies of combining them in a single solution. Cloudflare One brings those together on our network. By integrating both sides of the challenge, we can give administrators a single place to manage and secure their network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image3-9.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-differentiates-cloudflare-one&quot;&gt;What Differentiates Cloudflare One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;easy-to-deploy-manage-and-use&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy to Deploy, Manage, and Use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve always offered free and pay-as-you-go plans that teams of any size could sign up for with a credit card. Those customers lack the systems integrators or IT departments of large enterprises. To serve those teams, we had to build a control plane and dashboard that was accessible and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The products in Cloudflare One follow that same approach; comprehensive enough for enterprises but easy to use to make these products accessible to any team. We’ve also extended that to end users; the client application that powers Gateway is built on what we learned creating Cloudflare WARP for consumer users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unified-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unified Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One puts the entire corporate network behind a single pane of glass. By integrating with leading identity providers and endpoint security solutions, Cloudflare One enables companies to enforce a consistent set of policies across all their applications. Since the network is the common denominator of all applications, by building control into the network Cloudflare One ensures consistent policies whether an application is new or legacy, run on-premise or in the cloud, and delivered from your own infrastructure or a multi-tenant SaaS provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One also helps rationalize complicated deployments. While it would be great if every app and every employee and contractor used the same identity provider, for example, that isn’t always possible. Acquisitions, skunkworks projects, and internal disagreements can cause multiple different solutions to be present inside one company. Cloudflare One allows you to plug different providers into one unified network control plane to ensure consistent policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;significant-roi&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significant ROI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core tenet of serving the entire Internet has always forced us to obsess over costs. Efficiency is in the DNA of Cloudflare and we use our efficiency to pass along customer-friendly, fixed-rate pricing. Cloudflare One builds on that experience to deliver a platform that is more cost-effective than combining point solution vendors. The differences are especially apparent versus other providers who have tried to build on top of public cloud platforms and inherit their cost and inconsistent network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the level of efficiency needed to compete with hardware appliances required us to invent a new type of platform. That platform needed to be built on our own network where we could drive costs down and ensure the highest level of performance. It needed to be architected so any server in any city that made up Cloudflare’s network could run every one of our services. That means that Cloudflare One runs across Cloudflare’s global network spanning more than 200 cities worldwide. Even your farthest flung branch offices and remote workers are likely within milliseconds of servers powering Cloudflare One, ensuring our service works well wherever your team works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;leverages-cloudflare-s-scale&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leverages Cloudflare’s Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare already sits in front of a huge portion of the Internet. That allows us to see and respond to new security threats continuously. It also means that Cloudflare One customers’ traffic can be more efficiently routed, even when going to applications that would appear to be on the public Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, an employee behind Cloudflare One who is catching up on holiday shopping during their lunch break can have their traffic routed from a corporate branch office, across Cloudflare’s Magic Transit, over Cloudflare’s global backbone, across Cloudflare’s Network Interconnect, and to the ecommerce provider. Because Cloudflare handles the packets end-to-end, we can ensure they are encrypted, optimally routed, and efficiently delivered. As more of the Internet uses Cloudflare, the experience of surfing the Internet for Cloudflare One customers will grow even more exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-cloudflare-one-replace&quot;&gt;What Does Cloudflare One Replace?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of expensive MPLS links or complex SD-WAN deployments, Cloudflare One provides two on-ramps to your applications and the entire Internet: WARP and Magic Transit. WARP connects employees from any device, and any location, to Cloudflare’s network. Magic Transit allows broad deployments across whole offices or data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Access replaces private-networks-as-security with Zero Trust controls. Later this week, we’ll announce how you can extend Access to any application, including SaaS applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cloudflare One eliminates traditional network firewalls and web gateways. Cloudflare Gateway inspects traffic leaving any device in your organization to block threats on the Internet and prevent data from leaving. Magic Firewall will give your networks the same security, filtering traffic at the transport layer to replace the top-of-rack firewalls that block data exfiltration or attacks from unsecure network protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image1-9.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-comes-next&quot;&gt;What Comes Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your team can start using Cloudflare One today. Add Zero Trust control to your applications with Cloudflare Access and secure DNS queries with Cloudflare Gateway. Keep networks safe from DDoS attacks with Magic Transit and connect your applications through Cloudflare with Argo Tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the week, we’ll be launching new features and products to start to complete this vision. On Tuesday, we’ll extend the Zero Trust security of Cloudflare Access to all of your applications. Starting Wednesday, teams will be able to use Cloudflare WARP to proxy all employee traffic to Cloudflare where Gateway will now secure more than just DNS queries. You’ll be invited to sign up for Cloudflare’s browser isolation beta on Thursday and we’ll wrap the week with new APIs to control how Magic Transit secures your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a busy week, but we’re just getting started. Replacing a corporate network should not also mean you lose control over how that network operates. Magic WAN is our solution to complex SD-WAN deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security for that entire network should also work in both directions. Magic Firewall is our alternative to the clunky “next-generation firewall” appliances that secure outbound traffic. Data loss prevention (DLP) is another space that has lacked innovation and where we plan to extend Cloudflare One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2020/10/image6-3.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you should have visibility into that network. We’ll be launching new tools to detect and mitigate intrusion attempts that happen anywhere on your network, including unauthorized access to any SaaS applications you use. Now that we’ve built the on-ramps onto Cloudflare One, we’re excited to continue to innovate to provide more functionality and control to solve our customers biggest network security, performance, and reliability challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delivering-the-network-customers-need-today&quot;&gt;Delivering the Network Customers Need Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, Cloudflare has built one of the fastest, most reliable, most secure networks in the world. We’ve seen the power of using that network internally to enable our own teams to innovate quickly and securely. With the launch of Cloudflare One, we’re extending the power of Cloudflare’s network to meet the challenges of any company. The move to Zero Trust is a paradigm shift but the changes to how we work we believe has made it inevitable for every company. We’re proud of how we’ve been able to help some of Cloudflare One’s first customers reinvent their corporate networks. It makes sense to close with their own words.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft is not rebasing Windows to Linux</title>
<link>https://boxofcables.dev/no-microsoft-is-not-rebasing-windows-to-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boxofcables.dev/no-microsoft-is-not-rebasing-windows-to-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There have been a &lt;a href=&quot;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764&quot;&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-based-windows-makes-perfect-sense/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/could-microsoft-be-en-route-to-dumping-windows-in-favor-of-linux/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&amp;amp;taid=5f814f0d8911f90001eb9436&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Twitter+Card&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthemCard&amp;amp;utm_source=twitterCard&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; wondering aloud whether Microsoft is going to rebase Windows on the Linux kernel in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a unique perspective on Microsoft's Linux involvement. I help deliver Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux in my job on the Desktop team at Canonical. I regularly talk to many Microsoft employees working on Linux and various open source projects. I also get briefings on Microsoft products and strategy as an MVP. Note though, these are my personal thoughts, and I am not sharing anything here that is not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have become somewhat of an intermediary between the Microsoft and Linux communities. It is something I am glad to do. There are creative, kind, and fascinating people in both communities. Interesting things happen when the lines between them blur. Fostering cross-pollination will make computing better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;WSL does not by default do unattended upgrades, there is no traditional init like systemd to do them in the background. You can set a Basic Task in Windows Task Scheduler to run apt update as root on login, then add an action to that task that runs apt upgrade: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/jvaJIwfaqs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/jvaJIwfaqs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Using Windows Scheduler to run automated updates on Ubuntu on WSL
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply skeptical of the notion that Microsoft is going to shift the core of the Windows operating system to the Linux kernel, for both product and engineering reasons, any time soon. Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the reasons why I think this fantasy this keeps cropping up on Slashdot and Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is effective clickbait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a long-held fantasy for open source and Linux advocates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of Windows is changing in a world where the pie of operating systems powering devices is now shared with Android, iOS, macOS, Chrome OS, and Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The perceived plausibility of something like this is increasing, with things like Linux usage on Azure and WSL. The Overton Window has shifted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; readability=&quot;5.9672131147541&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Windows and Linux exist is an cosmic duality. Two opposing yet complimentary forces, we cannot have one without the other. Knowing how to blend the two is to conjure magic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Eoh22Rn4Fn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Eoh22Rn4Fn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Hayden Barnes (@unixterminal) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/unixterminal/status/1276895377430634498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 &quot;Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons I do not think Windows will be rebasing to a Linux kernel are as followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The NT kernel in Windows offers a degree of backward compatibility, long-term support, and driver availability that Linux is just now approaching. It would cost millions of dollars to replicate these in Linux. Microsoft has plenty of paying customers to continue supporting Windows as-is, some for decades. Windows is not a drain on Microsoft that would justify the expense of rebasing to Linux for savings, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764&quot;&gt;Raymond&lt;/a&gt; has argued. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcanoae.com/&quot;&gt;Lots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/&quot;&gt;profitable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vmssoftware.com/&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xinuos.com/&quot;&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt; solely to service existing operating systems. Even if it came down to rebasing to Linux, it could result in an undesirable kernel monoculture. Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system. The more desirable outcome is that open source innovation continues spreading across and between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; operating systems. That Windows and Linux open source contributors share the best of both ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unclear if the Windows user space could even be rebased from NT to the Linux kernel and maintain the compatibility that Windows is known for, specifically what enterprise clients with mission-critical applications are paying to get. Windows does not have the same strict division between kernel space and user space that Linux does. The NT kernel has about 400 documented syscalls plus about 1700 documented Win32 API calls. That would be a huge amount of re-implementation to ensure precise compatibility that Windows developers and their tools expect. It goes beyond contributing some fixes to Wine. Linux only has 313 syscalls on amd64 and, even then, part of the reason Microsoft switched from a syscall translation layer in WSL 1 to a virtualized kernel in WSL 2 is because re-implementing the dozens of non-standard ways developers had come to exploit the Linux ABI was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/4022&quot;&gt;a pain in the ass&lt;/a&gt;. It is one thing to provide a NT-related compatibility layer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2016/12/16/sql-server-on-linux-how-introduction/&quot;&gt;SQL Server on Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which Microsoft owns, it is another to guarantee it for millions of other developer's applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft has doubled down on Windows in recent years. Microsoft has invested in usability, new features, and performance improvements for Windows 10 that have paid off. These improvements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/what-are-microsoft-precision-touchpad-drivers&quot;&gt;collaborations with OEMs&lt;/a&gt;, and the Surface &lt;a href=&quot;https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/01/29/traditional-pcs-seeing-resurgence-after-7-years-of-decline.aspx&quot;&gt;helped revitalize&lt;/a&gt; a PC market that at one point &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/03/06/apple-google-microsoft-hewlett-packard-dell-ipad-iphone-android-ios-samsung-galaxy/1946325/&quot;&gt;looked in danger of falling&lt;/a&gt; to iPads and Chromebooks. Microsoft has been working hard to make Windows an excellent development platform, with projects like Windows Terminal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys&quot;&gt;PowerToys&lt;/a&gt;, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and Visual Studio 2019. The Insiders program is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-weve-got-10-million-insiders-testing-windows-10-to-keep-bugs-at-bay/&quot;&gt;remarkably successful&lt;/a&gt;. Windows powers most of the Surface device lineup, a key focus of Microsoft right now. Internal reorganizations in 2018 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-brings-windows-ux-surface-teams-together-exec-panos-panay-latest-reorg/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; show that the future of the Surface and Windows are now inextricably linked. Windows powers the Xbox and we are in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-pc-gaming-in-2020/&quot;&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt; of mostly Windows-based PC gaming. Microsoft also has ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x&quot;&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, the next operating system concept following Windows 10 (that I think we will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x-out-box-experienced-shown-leaked-video&quot;&gt;get in gradual pieces&lt;/a&gt;), with future hardware like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-confirms-its-dual-screen-surface-neo-has-been-delayed&quot;&gt;Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt; in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft does not have to rebase to Linux to stay relevant. Microsoft is aware of a changing device landscape after losing on Windows in mobile. They recognize a more diverse set of operating systems and platforms are powering the computing devices we use, which now includes Android, Ubuntu, iOS, macOS, Alexa, Chrome OS, and not just x86 but ARM. Microsoft has shown they are able to adapt by making relevant products and services available on those other platforms while simultaneously keeping their own platform, Windows, competitive in its traditional footholds. Microsoft is now driving innovation on Android in the mobile space, not just with ported Office apps, but a home screen launcher, and now the Surface Duo. On Ubuntu, they offer their tools that would make sense for Linux workstations, such as Code, .NET, Azure tools, Teams, PowerShell, Sysinternals for Linux, and soon Edge, which comes with Microsoft's custom &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide&quot;&gt;web dev tools&lt;/a&gt;. Do you want to run Ubuntu on Azure? Microsoft has you covered and works closely with Canonical to make that a wonderful experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much more interesting question is not whether Microsoft is planning to rebase Windows to Linux, but how far Windows will go on open source. We are already seeing components like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal&quot;&gt;Windows Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, PowerToys, and other Windows &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/&quot;&gt;components&lt;/a&gt; either begin life as or go open source. The more logical and realistic goal here is a continued opening of Windows components and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/WinDev&quot;&gt;Windows development&lt;/a&gt; process, even beyond the Insiders program, in a way that benefits other operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, Windows has already adopted the Ubuntu release cadence, of six-month releases in April and October with set releases getting extended support. Windows 2004 and Ubuntu 20.04 landed within days of each other. I kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond is correct in one key part of his blog. I do think the era of the desktop OS wars is ending. We are entering a new era where your high-end workstation will run multiple operating systems simultaneously, like runtimes, and not necessarily all locally. The choice will not really be Windows or Linux, it will be whether you boot Hyper-V or KVM first, and Windows and Ubuntu stacks will be tuned to run well on the other. Microsoft contributes patches to the Linux kernel to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-these-patches-aim-to-make-linux-run-as-root-partition-on-hyper-v/&quot;&gt;run Linux well on Hyper-V&lt;/a&gt; and tweaks Windows to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/11/windows_10_on_kvm/&quot;&gt;play nicely on KVM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of Ubuntu will come to Windows and parts of Windows will come to Linux, thanks to an increasing trend &lt;a href=&quot;https://boxofcables.dev/microsoft-and-open-source-an-unofficial-timeline/&quot;&gt;towards open source across Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key take-away though is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://boxofcables.dev/microsoft-and-open-source-an-unofficial-timeline/&quot;&gt;open source has won&lt;/a&gt;. And Raymond can be proud of helping to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html&quot;&gt;articulate the case&lt;/a&gt; for the open source development model when he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Windows nor Ubuntu are going anywhere. They are just going to keep getting better through open source. Each will play to their relative strengths. Just now with more open source collaboration than imaginable before.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Police killings more likely in agencies that get military gear, data shows</title>
<link>https://www.ajc.com/news/police-killings-more-likely-in-agencies-that-get-military-gear-data-shows/MBPQ2ZE3XFHR5NIO37BKONOCGI/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ajc.com/news/police-killings-more-likely-in-agencies-that-get-military-gear-data-shows/MBPQ2ZE3XFHR5NIO37BKONOCGI/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The results paint a troubling picture: The more equipment a department receives, the more people are shot and killed, even after accounting for violent crime, race, income, drug use and population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Only 7% of Georgia’s law enforcement agencies received surplus military gear at any time over the 10 years, but those agencies accounted for 17% of the 261 people shot and killed by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The statistical correlation doesn’t prove that 1033 gear in a police department causes more fatal police shootings, or that those shootings were unjustified, only that there is a strong relationship between the two. The analysis also doesn’t suggest that every department in the 1033 program displays a strong relationship between the number of people killed and the amount of 1033 funding accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Wayne McElrath, senior investigative advisor for the Washington-based Project on Government Oversight, said more violent confrontations with police track with a change in how police departments view their role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“The cost that we are dealing with now is a highly militarized police force that is no longer looking like police but (is) looking like they are patrolling a hostile foreign nation,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Social science research suggests militarization also impacts how citizens view police — both positively and negatively, depending on who was asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;McElrath, who has both law enforcement and military experience, has been critical of the 1033 program going back to his days directing investigations for the Government Accountability Office, an independent congressional watchdog agency. He said government initiatives like the 1033 program have encouraged police departments and the public to think of police as a fighting a war rather than their traditional role of ensuring public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“They are changing the culture,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are beginning to accept that it is the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A subtle impact to police culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The AJC analysis looked at departments across the state and measured the number of fatal police shootings in years following the receipt of military gear. Atlanta Police Department spokesman Sgt. John Chafee questioned if anyone could link a department’s use of the program to police shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;APD’s use of the 1033 program is limited. In 2009, the department took possession of a medical evacuation helicopter. Eight years later, the department got a new transmission for that helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“A suggestion this helicopter transmission somehow played a part in the number of fatal officer involved shootings seems like quite a stretch to me,” Chafee said. “I have been a police officer with Atlanta for more than 16 years and, until this week, had no idea we obtained a helicopter or helicopter transmission through this program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The statistical correlation found by the AJC doesn’t link a helicopter transmission with a fatal police shooting. Instead, the analysis measured the relationship between shootings and participation in the 1033 program across the state. That measurement found that civilian deaths rose when military gear was present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;b-margin-bottom-d40-m20 c-customHTML&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/EN737KEC75ADPIY7PC4Q6VT37U.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The number of killings increases as 1033 funding increases&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At low levels of 1033 acquisitions, even small increases in funding lead to increases in the expected number of killings. Increasing 1033 acquisitions at higher levels of funding has a smaller effect on the expected number of killings, but the effect is still there. This suggests a link between police killings and even small levels of militarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these numbers are small, they are for a single department in a single year and become scores of fatalities over the full dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The AJC analysis is patterned after several large-scale statistical studies tracing surplus military equipment and fatal police shootings. One of the most well-known was done in 2018 by Edward Lawson, a political science lecturer at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Lawson’s research, published in the academic journal Political Research Quarterly, looked at two years of data across the entire nation. Like the AJC study, Lawson found higher instances of police killings in departments that received 1033 equipment than in those that did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;In an interview with the AJC, Lawson said the relationship between departments that take 1033 equipment and violence is subtle, reflecting an outlook by police department leadership that trickles down to the officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“You’re not just police officers, you’re soldiers and you’re fighting this war on drugs, war on crime, and eventually the war on terror,&quot; he said. &quot;If all of your leaders are telling you that you’re fighting this war, and you’re on the front lines of it, that has to have a psychological effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Lawson’s research and the AJC’s own analysis suggest an indirect relationship or a statistical clue that links police militarization and civilian deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“Drawing a direct connection from equipment to killings doesn’t make sense, in part because most officers never get to use any of that stuff anyway,” Lawson said. “But if the agency as a whole is more psychologically militarized, that agency will pursue more military equipment and will also kill more civilians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From foreign battlefields to U.S. cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Increased concern over police-involved shootings across the nation has placed more focus on police militarization and the 1033 program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The program grew out of America’s long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which created a massive surplus in used military equipment. The Defense Department found a ready customer in local police whose budgets would otherwise put items like armored vehicles out of reach. As of this summer, about 8,200 local and state agencies in 49 states were actively enrolled in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Police departments can’t get everything from the military. For instance, tanks and large, crew-operated guns are off limits, as are actual military uniforms and body armor. Other items, like assault rifles and night-vision gear, are considered long-term “loans” to local agencies, but officially remain federal government property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;More than $7.4 billion in surplus equipment has been distributed since the program began in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;From 2009 to 2018, police departments in Georgia received $43.5 million in firearms, vehicles and other gear from the military, a figure that experts believe is deeply discounted because the material is used. All that equipment has been requested despite the fact that violent crime rates in Georgia have dropped by one third over that period, according to FBI crime statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;And while violent crime in the state has dropped, new research indicates departments that participate in the 1033 program cannot take the credit. A newly published article by a group of scholars with the Emory University Department of Political Science found no relationship between the presence of surplus military equipment and lower crime rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Tom Clark, one of the Emory professors behind the study, said the fact that the gear isn’t reducing crime amplifies the downsides to police militarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“When they are wearing all of this equipment and they have been given these bigger rifles and training in these armored vehicles, it just has to change their mindset,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/QNWQYTDDVJFM7E6WNOKVXS3XE4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More 1033 investment makes violent areas more deadly&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected number of killings for a single department in a single year increases as the area policed by the department becomes more violent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of people killed by police increases as violent crime in the area increases, police departments in equally dangerous neighborhoods kill different numbers of people depending on how much 1033 gear they acquired the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Clark said he is working with police in Fairfax, Va., to get funding for an experiment testing how police and the public react to different uniforms as a more precise way to measure the impact. “The police themselves believe that the way they are presenting themselves changes the nature of their interactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;DeKalb County Police Chief Mirtha Ramos doesn’t buy into the idea that the gear police officers wear or use makes them more of a threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“Just because we carry guns and wear a vest, it doesn’t mean we’re out to create violence,” said Ramos, who was hired to lead the metro department a year ago. “Our focus is just having the best trained best equipped and best trained officers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Yet the DeKalb County Police has made very little use of the 1033 program over the years, compared to other metro departments. And Ramos said they have done away with camouflage uniforms worn by some units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“We want to make sure we are not mistaken for anything that what we are,&quot; she said. “We are listening to the concerns of the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I don’t want my officers to look like soldiers’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Police leaders often justify their participation in the 1033 program as financially prudent, though experts such as McElrath say departments often overlook the hidden cost of training officers on specialized equipment and maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“It’s probably saved the (city) taxpayers a quarter of a million dollars,” said Tony Pyle, chief of the Calhoun Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;For its size, Pyle’s department in Gordon County has tapped the Defense Department for a lot of military gear over the years. The transfers from the federal program include 10 M16 and 20 M14 rifles, as well as night vision gear and an armored Humvee. The department has also gotten less lethal gear — such as a laser printer and a half-dozen ladders — from the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;But Pyle, who took over as police chief two years ago, said there are limits to what he thinks is appropriate for a city police department. For example, he mothballed the department’s M14s, locking them up in the evidence closet when he couldn’t get the Defense Department to take them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The M14 fires a high-caliber round. It’s powerful and has a long range. “It’s too much gun to be on the city streets,&quot; Pyle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Likewise, Pyle said he turned down the offer of a $750,000 armored vehicle, despite the fact that there are dozens of them in departments around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“It was basically a tank with wheels, I said, ‘Absolutely not. We do not want that thing rolling down the streets of Calhoun,’” he said. “In my humble opinion, it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Pyle said he thinks military-style gear and clothing can have an impact on a department. Along with shelving the M14s, Pyle said he ordered officers to wear traditional police uniforms, instead of the navy blue combat fatigues they had worn in the city for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“That’s not something I ever cared for,” he said. “I have the utmost respect for soldiers but I don’t want my officers to look like soldiers. We are police officers; we are here to serve and protect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Pyle’s department continues to get military equipment through the program. Much of the gear is used for non-military applications. For example, the night-vision gear is used when a search for a missing person drags into the night, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;But the city also gets more deadly items. Last year, the city’s take included 120 30-round magazines for its M16s. The guns can fire in three-shot bursts or single fire, and his officers are trained on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;“I don’t want to mislead you that it isn’t a military-grade weapon,&quot; he said, &quot;because it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the data analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;AJC data specialist &lt;strong&gt;Nick Thieme&lt;/strong&gt; obtained the data and performed the statistical analysis that produced the findings for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;Thieme used data from publicly available 1033 program acquisitions from the Defense Logistics Agency, a Department of Defense agency; violent crime and police agency information from the FBI; and population/economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Data about fatal police shootings are collected by the AJC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;He combined these datasets using Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) and by manually matching police department names. This data included data for departments that either accepted 1033 in-kind funding or killed a person in that year. He then supplemented this data with the missing years during which no items were requested and no people were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;One important change to the data was normalizing the dollar value of identical items. The same item — for example, a rifle firing 7.62 mm caliber rounds — was often listed as costing a different amount depending on when it was acquired and who acquired it. This variation has nothing to do with militarization, so average values were assigned to remove the variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;He then calculated simple averages and more complicated statistical modeling of the number of killings by department per year. This modeling followed various research papers with slight changes intended to better fit the data. There are well-studied methods for modeling count data with many zeros (data that measure how many of a particular event occurred during some time frame when that measurement is often 0), and one of the standards for this analysis was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20&quot;&gt;The model was then used to determine the effect of 1033 acquisitions on the number of people shot and killed. Because the number of people killed by police depends on the number of people in an area, its violent crime, race and income, these variables were included in the analysis. Lastly, the value of 1033 acquisitions was split between non-violent items, such as helicopter transmissions, lawn mowers, and trousers, and items that are more indicative of militarization, such as guns, ammunition, armor, military vehicles, night-vision equipment, and equipment listed by the Department of Defense as being critical to national security. Items were categorized according to the Department of Defense’s own National Stock Numbers (NSN) and Federal Stock Classes (FSC).&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>A new AJC analysis of a decade of records across 651 Georgia police departments and sheriff’s offices found departments that took more than $1,000 in surplus military gear, on average, fatally shot about four times as many people as those that didn’t.</og:description>
