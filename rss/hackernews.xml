<title>New Zealand is about to test long-range wireless power transmission</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://singularityhub.com/2020/08/30/new-zealand-is-about-to-test-long-range-wireless-power-transmission/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Nikola_Tesla%2C_with_his_equipment_EDIT.jpg&quot;&gt;famous image&lt;/a&gt; of inventor Nikola Tesla shows him casually sitting on a chair, legs crossed, taking notes—oblivious to the profusion of artificial lightning rending the air meters away. By then, Tesla and raw electricity were like an old married couple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experiments, conducted in Colorado, led to one of Tesla’s most audacious proposals: To power the world without wires. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslasociety.com/tesla_tower.htm&quot;&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; with plans for a “world wireless system,” and won funding from JP Morgan to build the first of several huge transmission towers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Tesla’s wireless energy dream died soon after.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;JP Morgan canceled additional funding. The tower was demolished. Later scientists were skeptical Tesla’s plans (which were a bit vague) would have worked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Tesla’s peer Guglielmo Marconi pursued a parallel dream with far greater success: The wireless transmission of information on radio waves.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oday’s world is, of course, awash in wireless information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, if New Zealand startup Emrod has its way, Tesla and Marconi’s dreams may merge. The company is building a system to wirelessly beam power over long distances. Earlier this month,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emrod.energy/press-release-nz-start-up-launches-world-first-long-range-wireless-power-transmission/&quot;&gt;Emrod received funding from Powerco&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand’s second biggest utility, to conduct a test of its system at a grid-connected commercial power station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company hopes to bring energy to communities far from the grid or transmit power from remote renewable sources, like offshore wind farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The system consists of four components: A power source, a transmitting antenna, several (or more) transmitting relays, and a rectenna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, the transmitting antenna transforms electricity into microwave energy—an electromagnetic wave just like Marconi’s radio waves, only a bit more energetic—and focuses it into a cylindrical beam. The microwave beam is sent through a series of relays until it hits the rectenna,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which converts it back into electricity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With safety in mind, Emrod is using energy in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, and keeping the power density low. “It’s not just how much power you deliver, it’s how much power you deliver per square meter,” Emrod founder, Greg Kushnir, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newatlas.com/energy/wireless-power-transmission-emrod-interview/&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New Atlas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The levels of density we’re using are relatively low. At the moment, it’s about the equivalent of standing outside at noon in the sun, about 1 kW per square meter.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if it works as intended, the beam won’t ever contact anything but empty air. The system uses a net of lasers surrounding the beam to detect obstructions, like a bird or person, and it automatically shuts off transmission until the obstruction has moved on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology—power transmission via microwave energy—has been around for decades. But to make it commercially viable, you have to minimize energy losses. Kushnir said metamaterials developed in recent years are the difference-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company uses metamaterials to more efficiently convert the microwave beam back into electricity. The relays, which are like “lenses” extending the beam beyond line-of-sight by refocusing it, are nearly lossless. According to Kushnir, most of losses happen at the other end, where electricity is converted into microwave energy. Overall, he said the system’s efficiency is around 70%, which is short of copper wires but economically viable in some areas. And it’s those areas the company’s aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…we don’t foresee in the near future a situation where we could say all copper wire can be replaced by wireless,” Kushnir said. “Inherently, it’ll have lower efficiency levels. It’s not about replacing the whole infrastructure but augmenting it in places where it makes sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Real-World Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s prototype can currently send a few watts of energy over a distance of about 130 feet. For the Powerco project, they’re working on a larger version capable of beaming a few kilowatts. The plan is to deliver the new system to Powerco in October, test it in the lab for a few months, and then, if all goes to plan, try it out in the field. The tests will aim to validate how much power the system can transmit over what distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the current model is modest, Kushnir says it should scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can use the exact same technology to transmit 100 times more power over much longer distances,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://emrod.energy/press-release-nz-start-up-launches-world-first-long-range-wireless-power-transmission/&quot;&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Wireless systems using Emrod technology can transmit any amount of power current wired solutions transmit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Simpkin, Emrod’s chief scientific officer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/emrod-chases-the-dream-of-utilityscale-wireless-power-transmission&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company is also looking into whether they could beam power across 30 kilometers of water from the New Zealand mainland to Stewart Island. He said the system could cost as little as 60 percent of an undersea cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the technology may help power rural areas or transmit energy from offshore wind farms, both cases where it’s expensive to build physical infrastructure to tap or feed the grid. In other cases, say in national parks, a mode of wireless transmission could have less impact on the environment and require less maintenance. Or it might be used to provide power after natural disasters in which physical infrastructure has been damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not Tesla’s “world wireless system,” but it just might make long-distance wireless power a commercial reality in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Apple will no longer allow users to sign into Epic Games accounts using “Sign In with Apple” as soon as September 11, 2020.

&lt;br/&gt;Customers who do not update to a standard email address and password will not be able to log in to their accounts, but after September 11, those who did not transition from ‌Sign in with Apple‌ may be able to contact Epic Games to have their accounts recovered manually.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210318&quot;&gt;Sign in with Apple&lt;/a&gt; is a feature that allows Apple device users to sign in to accounts and services using their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/&quot;&gt;Apple ID&lt;/a&gt;, with that info obscured from the website or service for privacy purposes. It's similar to Google and Facebook account sign in options, but with Apple promising greater privacy through options like Hide My Email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature was introduced as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-13/&quot;&gt;iOS 13&lt;/a&gt; and apps and services have been adopting it since then. Apple requires any app that uses Google and Facebook login options to also offer ‌Sign in with Apple‌.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most open-access journals lack the technical means and plans to preserve their articles, despite a mandate from some funders that they do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/author/jeffrey-brainard&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Brainard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Sep. 8, 2020 , 4:10 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty-four online-only, open-access (OA) journals in the sciences, and nearly 100 more in the social sciences and humanities, have disappeared from the internet over the past 2 decades as publishers stopped maintaining them, potentially depriving scholars of useful research findings, a study has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional 900 journals published only online also &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11933.pdf&quot;&gt;may be at risk of vanishing&lt;/a&gt; because they are inactive, says a preprint posted on 3 September on the arXiv server. The number of OA journals tripled from 2009 to 2019, and on average the vanished titles operated for nearly 10 years before going dark, which “might imply that a large number … is yet to vanish,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t identify examples of prominent journals or articles that were lost, nor collect data on the journals’ impact factors and citation rates to the articles. About half of the journals were published by research institutions or scholarly societies; none of the societies are large players in the natural sciences. None of the now-dark journals was produced by a large commercial publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, “The analysis demonstrates that research integrity and the scholarly record preservation … are at risk across all academic disciplines and geographical regions,&quot; says Andrea Marchitelli, managing editor of &lt;em&gt;JLIS.it&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Italian Journal of Library, Archives, and Information Science&lt;/em&gt;, who was not involved in the study. Publishers should dedicate money to improve preservation, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new mandate by research funders set to take effect in January 2021 requires preservation schemes—but most online-only journals currently lack such plans, the authors say. The new preservation rule is contained in Plan S, backed by mostly European research funders. Scholars financed by Plan S funders must make the articles OA (immediately free to read upon publication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, only about one-third of the 14,068 journals indexed in the &lt;em&gt;Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 ensure the long-term preservation of their content, the preprint study found. Some commercial services offer it, and at least one—the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/&quot;&gt;Public Knowledge Project Preservation Network,&lt;/a&gt; a multiuniversity initiative—does so for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how many subscription-based journals also have gone dark in recent years. But such journals have some advantages over OA titles when it comes to preservation, says Mikael Laakso of the Hanken School of Economics, one of the authors of the new study. “Subscription-based content has historically been better covered by libraries, either by having paper copies on shelves or electronically,” he wrote in an email. “There’s been established processes, budgets, and culture in place for libraries to preserve purchased content, while what is just out there available for anyone to download for free has not been enrolled in such processes and thus runs the risk of falling through the cracks if the publisher vanishes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little consensus about who is ultimately responsible for digital preservation of OA journals—publishers, authors, libraries, or universities. Preserving OA journals may pose a particularly big financial challenge for those publishers that do not charge authors to publish articles. Library budgets, meanwhile, have faced cuts or minimal growth. Articles that appeared in vanished journals could also be preserved in university repositories—a form of preservation called “green” open access— but not all institutions or funders mandate that the manuscripts be deposited in such repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preservation “is a time-consuming activity,” Marchitelli says, “and sometimes seems less important than working on the inclusion of the articles in bibliographic databases,” which European funders often use to evaluate the quality of university scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the list of the 176 vanished journals, the authors of the new preprint did some digital detective work because clues about them are fragmentary. After the journals go dark, for example, their names no longer appear in bibliometric databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors—Laakso, Lisa Matthias of the Free University of Berlin, and Najko Jahn of the University of Göttingen—defined a vanished journal as one that published at least one complete volume as immediate OA, and less than 50% of its content is now available for free online. Some of the content may be accessible as printed copies or in paywalled commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used a historical archive of internet content, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, to determine when production ceased (6 years after the journal started, on average) and when content disappeared from the internet (within 5 years for three-quarters of the journals). The journals had been based in 50 different countries, most of them high-income ones. Most of the lost journals published articles only in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laakso notes that many predictions have been made that OA journals represent the future of scholarly publishing. But, he adds, his study suggests that “maybe we could also spend a bit more time looking at more problematic aspects that could be improved as the publishing model matures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T smartphone users who see their network indicators switch from &quot;4G&quot; to &quot;5G&quot; shouldn't necessarily expect that they're about to get faster speeds. In PCMag's annual mobile-network testing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020&quot;&gt;released today&lt;/a&gt;, 5G phones connected to AT&amp;amp;T got slower speeds than 4G phones in 21 out of 22 cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCMag concluded that &quot;AT&amp;amp;T 5G right now appears to be essentially worthless,&quot; though AT&amp;amp;T's average download speed of 103.1Mbps was nearly as good as Verizon's thanks to a strong 4G performance. Of course, AT&amp;amp;T 5G should be faster than 4G in the long run—this isn't another case of AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/atts-5g-e-is-actually-slower-than-verizon-and-t-mobile-4g-study-finds/&quot;&gt;misleadingly labeling&lt;/a&gt; its 4G network as a type of 5G. Instead, the disappointing result on PCMag's test has to do with how today's 5G phones work and with how AT&amp;amp;T allocates spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counterintuitive result doesn't reveal much about the actual differences between 4G and 5G technology. Instead, it's reflective of how AT&amp;amp;T has used its spectrum to deploy 5G so far. As PCMag explained, &quot;AT&amp;amp;T's 5G slices off a narrow bit of the old 850MHz cellular band and assigns it to 5G, to give phones a valid 5G icon without increasing performance. And because of the way current 5G phones work, it often &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's 4G network benefits from the aggregation of channels from different frequencies. &quot;The most recent phones are able to assemble up to seven of them—that's called seven-carrier aggregation, and it's why AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2019&quot;&gt;won [the PCMag tests] last year&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; the article said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5G phones can't handle that yet, PCMag analyst Sascha Segan wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 5G phones can't add as many 4G channels to a 5G channel. So if they're in 5G mode, they're giving up 4G channels so they can use that extremely narrow, often 5MHz 5G channel, and the result is slower performance: faux G. For AT&amp;amp;T, using a 5G phone in testing was often a step &lt;em&gt;backward&lt;/em&gt; from our 4G-only phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, &quot;at locations with both 4G and 5G, our 5G phone was slower than our 4G phone in 21 out of 22 cities,&quot; the article said. While AT&amp;amp;T 5G phones often accessed just 5MHz of spectrum, Segan wrote that his analysis shows it &quot;takes at least 50MHz of dedicated 5G spectrum to make a real difference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference was stark in some cities. In Baltimore, where AT&amp;amp;T provided average speeds of 117.1Mbps, &quot;kicking into 5G mode... reduc[ed AT&amp;amp;T's] average download speeds by a shocking 61 percent across the city,&quot; PCMag &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020/baltimore&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile 5G wasn't always faster than 4G. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020/austin&quot;&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile had the most 5G availability of any carrier, but &quot;its 5G results were 17 percent slower than its 4G results at locations where both networks were available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCMag has been testing mobile networks for 11 years and had to adjust how it reported results this year because of the curious 5G results, Segan noted on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;The shocker this year was how to cope with 5G networks that were SLOWER than 4G networks in the same place. We had to use a &quot;best of&quot; rule and not count pure 5G availability in our overall scores. But ALL 5G networks were less available than they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sascha Segan (@saschasegan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1303333842644873217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCMag said it conducted tests with Samsung Galaxy S10 and S20 phones, chosen &quot;because they offer the best 4G and 5G performance available, with the S20 supporting all the different types of 5G US carriers have to offer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said early 5G would be similar to 4G&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked AT&amp;amp;T if it plans any changes, such as assigning more than 5MHz to the 5G channel or switching phones back to 4G when it's the fastest option, and will update this article if we get a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/at-launch-atts-real-5g-will-only-be-as-fast-as-its-fake-5g/&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said&lt;/a&gt; its early 5G deployments on the 850MHz band would only offer speeds that are similar to LTE-Advanced, a form of 4G that AT&amp;amp;T has &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/05/att-still-refuses-to-kill-misleading-5ge-network-icon-for-4g-service/&quot;&gt;misleadingly called&lt;/a&gt; &quot;5GE&quot; or &quot;5G Evolution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the 5G slowdown in PCMag tests, AT&amp;amp;T's strong 4G performance helped it achieve an average download speed of 103.1Mbps, ahead of T-Mobile's 74Mbps and behind Verizon's 105.1Mbps. AT&amp;amp;T also provided speeds above 10Mbps in 95 percent of tests, the highest of the three carriers. PCMag testers were able to get an AT&amp;amp;T 5G signal 38 percent of the time, compared to T-Mobile's 54 percent and Verizon's 4 percent. (Verizon 5G uses only millimeter-wave spectrum that has a much smaller reach than low- and mid-band spectrum.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T won the overall speed title in 12 out of 26 cities, compared to 13 for Verizon and one for T-Mobile. AT&amp;amp;T offers 5G in 22 of the 26 cities tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCMag didn't test rural areas this year because it had to adjust procedures for the pandemic. Instead of a travel schedule involving flights, rental cars, and hotels, PCMag said it hired &quot;two dozen drivers to each test their own cities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon 5G network “mind-blowing” but tiny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of rural tests means the averages found by PCMag are likely higher than the nationwide reality. OpenSignal, which relies on user-initiated speed tests, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/07/usa/mobile-network-experience&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; average download speeds of 32.6Mbps for AT&amp;amp;T, 28.2Mbps for T-Mobile, 27.4Mbps for Verizon, and 25.4Mbps for T-Mobile subsidiary Sprint. Those speeds include all networks, not just 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSignal found &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/5g-in-us-averages-51mbps-while-other-countries-hit-hundreds-of-megabits/&quot;&gt;average 5G speeds&lt;/a&gt; of 494.7Mbps for Verizon, 60.8Mbps for AT&amp;amp;T, and about 49Mbps for both T-Mobile and Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCMag and OpenSignal tests agree that Verizon's 5G network is the hardest one to find. Users of OpenSignal's speed-test app were able to get a Verizon 5G signal just 0.4 percent of the time, compared to 22.5 percent for T-Mobile, 14.1 percent for Sprint, and 10.3 percent for AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Verizon's 5G is often mind-blowing, but very difficult to find,&quot; PCMag wrote. Though it can offer &quot;speeds up to 2Gbps and latencies well under 10ms,&quot; Verizon 5G was often available in only two or three percent of locations in individual cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon 5G's ultra-high speed and sparse availability are not surprising because it uses the 28GHz spectrum band, which offers plenty of capacity but without the ability to cover long distances or penetrate walls and other obstacles. AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile 5G use the same low-band spectrum bands they use for 4G, ensuring wider coverage but without huge speed boosts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why is there a normal galaxy sitting at the edge of the Universe?</title>
<link>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-is-there-a-normal-galaxy-sitting-at-the-edge-of-the-universe</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-is-there-a-normal-galaxy-sitting-at-the-edge-of-the-universe</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Aided by a trick of gravity, astronomers have found a normal galaxy. Big deal, right? The thing is, where they found it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; normal: The light we see from it left the galaxy &lt;strong&gt;12.4 billion years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning we’re seeing it as it was when the Universe itself was only 1.4 billion years old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2013/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;That’s what makes this so weird&lt;/a&gt;. A normal galaxy has no business being there when the cosmos was so young. But yet, there it sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node__related-articles&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Bad Astronomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galaxy is called SPT–S J041839–4751.9 (let’s call it SPT0418 for short) and was discovered in a sky survey using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pole.uchicago.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the South Pole Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, which looks at light in the millimeter wavelengths, far outside what our eyes can see. The galaxy was flagged as interesting at the time, since it appeared to be dusty and cranking out new stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2013/eso2013a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Follow-up observations were made using ALMA&lt;/a&gt;, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, which is far more powerful and has much keener eyesight, so to speak. What they saw is one of the first weird things about this normal galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal, eh? That looks pretty peculiar to me: It’s a ring! Except that’s a mirage of sorts. By coincidence, almost exactly in a line between us and SPT0418 is another galaxy, located about 3 billion light years from us. As the light from SPT0418 passed this closer galaxy on its way to us, its path got bent by the gravity of the intervening galaxy. We call such a beast a &lt;em&gt;gravitational lens&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/sunburst-arc-reveals-how-infant-universe-lit-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot are known&lt;/a&gt;. They distort the shape of the more distant galaxy, sometimes into multiple blobs, or arcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size file-metadata-processed media-youtube-1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;lazyload media-youtube-player&quot; id=&quot;media-youtube-rlimylt7fma&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; title=&quot;Gravitational lensing of the distant SPT0418-47 galaxy (schematic)&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLiMyLT7fmA?wmode=opaque&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;playerapiid=media-youtube-rlimylt7fma&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of Gravitational lensing of the distant SPT0418-47 galaxy (schematic)&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distorting the light into a ring needs near perfect alignment, and that’s pretty rare. Even though the shape is warped, a big advantage is that the light gets amplified, making faint galaxies visible — there’s no way this extremely distant galaxy would be observable in any detail without the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravitational lensing was predicted by the equations of relativity (they’re sometimes called &lt;em&gt;Einstein rings&lt;/em&gt;), and in a sense the equations can be reversed to figure out what the lensed galaxy really looks like. The astronomers did this modeling, and what they found is actually pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The galaxy looks … normal. Like a disk-shaped galaxy you’d see nearby in the Universe, even like the Milky Way (though only about a quarter the mass of our galaxy). It has a flat disk of stars, gas, and dust, and even a central bulge of stars like our galaxy does, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike ours, though, this galaxy is particularly fecund. It’s making stars at a rate of 350 times the mass of the Sun per year! That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, as much as &lt;em&gt;two hundred times&lt;/em&gt; the rate the Milky Way makes stars. SPT0418 is what we aptly call a &lt;em&gt;starburst galaxy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s why it’s so weird. Theoretical studies of how galaxies form and evolve over time indicate that such starburst galaxies should be pretty chaotic-looking, chewed up by the turbulence created when stars are cranked out at that rate. Massive stars blow powerful winds, supernovae detonate like flashbulbs, and all that energy released should stir the gas up in the galaxy, making it irregularly shaped (plus, that early in the age of the Universe there just hadn't been a lot of time to get organized). Most distant galaxies we see are indeed blobby. The fact that this galaxy has a disk that appears to be pretty calm and stable is bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it’s not alone. Earlier in 2020 astronomers announced they found a disk galaxy at about the same distance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-did-this-galaxy-emerge-from-the-chaos-just-15-billion-years-after-the-big-bang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called the Wolfe Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. Like this one, it’s not understood how it can exist. Clearly, the theoretical models are wrong, or at least (and more likely) incomplete. Obviously, there’s more to learn about galaxies that exist at the edge of the observable Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, observing galaxies like this so far away is nearly impossible without gravitational lensing, which is random and sparsely spaced across the sky. That means it’s hard to look this far away and see what’s going on, so we have to rely on our theory. But then we build ever better telescopes like ALMA, and find out that things are different than we expected. That happens pretty often. So finding a weirdly normal galaxy in a normally weird place is, oddly, weirdly normal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job now is to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

The objective was to create a public market designed for trading the stocks of companies organized to sustain long-term thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the few things that pretty much everyone agreed on is that the focus on the short term undermines the building of sustainable businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

Trillions of dollars would have been redirected toward training employees, breakthrough research, strengthening corporate balance sheets and making needed investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research, time and resources are precious. Automating common tasks, such as data collection, can make a project efficient and repeatable, leading in turn to increased productivity and output. You will end up with a shareble and reproducible method for data collection that can be verified, used and expanded on by others — in other words, a computationally reproducible data-collection workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a current project, we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;analysing coroners’ reports&lt;/a&gt; to help to prevent future deaths. It has required downloading more than 3,000 PDFs to search for opioid-related deaths, a huge data-collection task. In discussion with the larger team, we decided that this task was a good candidate for automation. With a few days of work, we were able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/georgiarichards/opioiddeaths&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/georgiarichards/opioiddeaths&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;write a computer program&lt;/a&gt; that could quickly, efficiently and reproducibly collect all the PDFs and create a spreadsheet that documented each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a tool is called a ‘web scraper’, and our group employs them regularly. We use them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/registry_scrapers_parsers&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/registry_scrapers_parsers&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;collect information from clinical-trial registries&lt;/a&gt;, and to enrich our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing/blob/master/openprescribing/pipeline/management/commands/fetch_and_import_ncso_concessions.py&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing/blob/master/openprescribing/pipeline/management/commands/fetch_and_import_ncso_concessions.py&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;OpenPrescribing.net data set&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprescribing.net/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://openprescribing.net/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;primary-care prescribing in England&lt;/a&gt; — tasks that would range from annoying to impossible without the help of some relatively simple code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of our coroner-reports project, we could manually screen and save about 25 case reports every hour. Now, our program can save more than 1,000 cases per hour while we work on other things, a 40-fold time saving. It also opens opportunities for collaboration, because we can share the resulting database. And we can keep that database up to date by re-running our program as new PDFs are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we offer some basics about web scraping and how you can start using it in your research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does scraping work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web scrapers are computer programs that extract information from — that is, ‘scrape’ — web sites. The structure and content of a web page are encoded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which you can see using your browser’s ‘view source’ or ‘inspect element’ function. A scraper understands HTML, and is able to parse and extract information from it. For example, you can program your scraper to extract specific fields of information from an online table or download documents linked on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/collections/bjacdafieh/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02558-0/d41586-020-02558-0_17223042.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common scraping task involves iterating over every possible URL from www.example.com/data/1 to www.example.com/data/100 (sometimes called ‘crawling’) and storing what you need from each page without the risk of human error during extraction. Once your program is written, you can recapture these data whenever you need to, assuming the structure of the website stays mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all scraping tasks require programming. When you visit a web page in your browser, off-the-shelf browser extensions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprescribing.net/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://openprescribing.net/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;webscraper.io&lt;/a&gt; let you click on the elements of the page that contain the data that you’re interested in. They can then automatically parse the relevant parts of the HTML and export the data as a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to build your own scraper — a more difficult process, but one that offers greater control. We use Python, but any modern programming language should work. (For specific packages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; work well together in Python; for R, try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;rvest&lt;/a&gt;.) It’s worth checking whether anyone else has already written a scraper for your data source. If not, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;no shortage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; and free tutorials to help you to get started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-web-scraping-rvest&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-web-scraping-rvest&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;no matter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-scraping-with-node-js-daa2027dcd3/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-scraping-with-node-js-daa2027dcd3/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;your preferred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://estadistika.github.io//web/scraping/philippines/julia/programming/packages/2018/10/30/Introduction-to-Web-Scraping-Julia.html&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://estadistika.github.io//web/scraping/philippines/julia/programming/packages/2018/10/30/Introduction-to-Web-Scraping-Julia.html&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most programming projects, there will be some trial and error, and different websites might use different data structures or variations in how their HTML is implemented that will require tweaks to your approach. Yet this problem-solving aspect of development can be quite rewarding. As you get more comfortable with the process, overcoming these barriers will start to seem like second nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/collections/fxvqrpnlcq&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-020-02558-0/d41586-020-02558-0_16573690.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be advised: depending on the number of pages, your Internet connection and the website’s server, a scraping job could still take days. If you have access and know-how, running your code on a private server can help. On a personal computer, make sure to prevent your computer from sleeping, which will disrupt the Internet connection. Also, think carefully about how your scraper can fail. Ideally, you should have a way to log failures so that you know what worked, what didn’t and where to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things to consider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you get the data an easier way?&lt;/strong&gt; Scraping all 300,000+ records off of ClinicalTrials.gov every day would be a massive job for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;FDAAA TrialsTracker&lt;/a&gt; project. Luckily, ClinicalTrials.gov makes their full dataset &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;; our software simply grabs that file once per day. We weren’t so lucky with the data for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://eu.trialstracker.net/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://eu.trialstracker.net/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;EU TrialsTracker&lt;/a&gt;, so we scrape the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/euctr-tracker-code&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/ebmdatalab/euctr-tracker-code&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;EU registry monthly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no bulk download available, check to see whether the website has an application programming interface (API). An API lets software interact with a website’s data directly, rather than requesting the HTML. This can be much less burdensome than scraping individual web pages, but there might be a fee associated with API access (see, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Google’s Map API&lt;/a&gt;). In our work, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;PubMed API&lt;/a&gt; is often useful. Alternatively, check whether the website operators can provide the data to you directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can this website be scraped?&lt;/strong&gt; Some websites don’t make their data available directly in the HTML and might require some more advanced techniques (check resources such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; for help with specific questions). Other websites include protections like captchas and anti-denial-of-service (DoS) measures that can make scraping difficult. A few websites simply don’t want to be scraped and are built to discourage it. It’s also common to allow scraping but only if you follow certain rules, usually codified in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;robots.txt file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you being a courteous scraper?&lt;/strong&gt; Every time your program requests data from a website, the underlying information needs to be ‘served’ to you. You can only move so quickly in a browser, but a scraper could potentially send hundreds to thousands of requests per minute. Hammering a web server like that can slow, or entirely bring down, the website (essentially performing an unintentional DoS attack). This could get you temporarily, or even permanently, blocked from the website — and you should take care to minimize the chances of harm. For instance, you can pause your program for a few seconds between each request. (Check the site’s robots.txt file to see whether it specifies a desired pause length.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the data restricted?&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to check for licensing or copyright restrictions on the extracted data. You might be able to use what you scrape, but it’s worth checking that you can also legally share it. Ideally, the website content licence will be readily available. Whether or not you can share the data, you should share your code using services such as GitHub — this is good open-science practice and ensures that others can discover, repeat and build on what you’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly feel that more researchers should be developing code to help conduct their research, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l6365&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l6365&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;then sharing it&lt;/a&gt; with the community. If manual data collection has been an issue for your project, a web scraper could be the perfect solution and a great beginner coding project. Scrapers are complex enough to teach important lessons about software development, but common and well-documented enough that beginners can feel confident experimenting. Writing some relatively simple code on your computer and having it interact with the outside world can feel like a research superpower. What are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vue.js Creator Evan You Interview</title>
<link>https://evrone.com/evan-you-interview</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://evrone.com/evan-you-interview</guid>
<description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Evan You is an independent software developer and the creator of the open source JavaScript framework Vue.js. We had a chance to speak to Evan about the release of Vue 3, his opinion on no-backend &amp;amp; fullstack approaches, Vue.js use cases and the work-life balance of the creator of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;The Interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone:  &lt;/strong&gt;Hey Evan, it’s great having you here today! Let's start our interview with such a question: your Patreon-funded full-time job position is quite unique. How do you organize your work-life balance and avoid burnouts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan:&lt;/strong&gt; I try to follow a fixed schedule every day even though I’m self-employed and working from home. Having kids actually helps a lot in this regard because I get to (and have to) spend time with family whenever I’m not working. Another important thing is that I take long breaks (several weeks) whenever I feel I need to — which is probably harder to do if I’m a full time employee at a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone:&lt;/strong&gt; Great!&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vue 3 release is around the corner. Will you take a break after it or do you already have plans for the next version of the new Vite build system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;I always have a long backlog. For Vite, the current goal is actually just making it more stable — it’s a new system and people are trying to use it in scenarios that I didn’t initially design for, so we will give it some time to see where it should evolve next. There are also already ideas lined up for Vue 3.1. But I will definitely take a break, it’s important to recharge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt;You joined Google Creative Lab as a creative technologist with an Art History major. Did you experience any lack of math, algorithms and data structures education while working on the Vue? Do we need to study computer science theory to become programmers, or do we need to learn how to be &quot;software writers&quot; and prefer code that is boring but easy to understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;Honestly not much — personally I think that Vue, or front-end frameworks in general, isn’t a particularly math/algorithm intensive field (compared to databases, for example). I also still don’t consider myself very strong in algorithm or data structures. It definitely helps to be good in those, but building a popular framework has a lot more to do with understanding your users, designing sensible APIs, building communities, and long term maintenance commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I don’t think being a “software writer” is mutually exclusive with writing “boring but easy to understand code”. It actually takes quite some experience to write boring but easy to understand code (provided that it’s not terribly inefficient)! I don’t think you should feel unqualified to write software just because you didn’t go through rigorous CS training, but I also don’t think you should ignore them. I personally took a pragmatic approach where I did a lot of things the dumb way first, which helps to reveal what I needed to learn to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone:&lt;/strong&gt; Awesome. With lots of technologies like Nuxt.js and JAMstack, it's tempting for developers to focus entirely on the frontend part of their applications and use minimal/JS/BaaS backend. What do you think about these &quot;no-backend&quot; or &quot;fullstack&quot; approaches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;I think it’s more like the product being built driving the technology being used. Developers move toward such stacks because it fits the type of products they are building: relatively simple backend logic with more focus on frontend interaction. It’s obviously not a silver bullet but it fits a certain category of apps very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt;Vue was rewritten a number of times. If you could travel back in time and give only one piece of technical advice to the younger self, what advice would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;How to better separate and decouple internal modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt; For the last few years, we have observed parallel JavaScript and TypeScript evolution. What is your bet on the near future: will we eventually have types added to the core JavaScript, or TypeScript will replace JavaScript, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;I think having types added to JS itself is a long, long shot — I personally don’t think it’s going to happen, because designing a type system by committee (and judging from the way TC39 operates) is… quite impractical. TypeScript won’t replace JS because it’s designed to be a superset of JS. Personally, I think having JS and TS (superset with types) evolve in parallel is the most practical way forward and it’s going to be that way for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt; Vue’s user base is already over a million developers. What do you think is the best way to measure technology adoption? Stack Overflow questions, GitHub stars and other public access metrics are great, but there are lots of corporate users working on isolated networks who do not ask questions a lot and &quot;just use the technology&quot;. How can we count them toward technology popularity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;This is an intrinsically difficult problem for open-source software, because users have no obligation to report usage and as authors we don’t really have reliable ways to track it, especially if the apps are not public facing. This is why I consider the devtools extension user count to be the most reliable metric since it takes all users into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt; There is lots of tree-shaking work in the upcoming Vue.js 3. Why do you think tree-shaking took so long to land into modern frameworks? Are there any major difficulties with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;The way tree shaking works relies on the source code being structured in a specific way — which means it works best when the code is written (and APIs designed) with tree-shaking in mind from day 1. It is very difficult to make an existing, non-trivial codebase tree-shaking friendly because it either requires breaking changes in the API or major refactoring (which comes with major risks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt;The &quot;Function-based Component API&quot; proposal for Vue 3 received a massive pushback from community members. Do you have any afterthoughts about it worth sharing with other developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;The pushback mainly came from the fear that we will be deprecating Vue’s current (2.x) API, and it was a mistake for us to consider it. As authors and maintainers, we typically interact with the most enthusiastic early adopters in our daily work, who are naturally more excited about new ideas than average users, which led us to misjudge the importance of backwards compatibility. Users don’t like things being taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;The takeaway is you need to understand what your users want — it’s not that easy and sometimes you will get that information the hard way, but you need to be willing to listen regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;18&quot; readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evrone: &lt;/strong&gt;Vue use cases range from small businesses to mid-sized agencies and multi-billion dollar public companies. Louis Vuitton and NASA are using Vue. Are there any Vue use cases that you would recommend to check out as an example of the complex, real-world frontend authored with Vue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evan: &lt;/strong&gt;The problem is that most “complex, real-world frontend” projects are not open-source. I’d recommend checking out Vue Devtools and the Vue CLI UI — both are non-trivial interfaces written in Vue, although they are not typical consumer facing web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;The conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We had a great time speaking with Evan and learning more about his approach to life &amp;amp; writing code. At Evrone, we frequently use Vue.js to create custom solutions that meet our clients’ unique needs. We love it when we get an opportunity to learn from a technology’s creator because it strengthens our expertise and gives us more tools that we can use to develop innovative new products. If you have an idea for a project that would benefit from Vue.js, just reach out to us, and we would love to help.&lt;/p&gt;
