&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; A &quot;hero&quot; project is one where 80% or more of the contributions are made by the 20% of the developers. In the literature, such projects are deprecated since they might cause bottlenecks in development and communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this matter. Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are very prevalent. Accordingly, this paper explores the effect of having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective. We identify the heroes developer communities in 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, we find that (a) hero projects are majorly all projects; and (b) the commits from &quot;hero developers&quot; (who contribute most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers. That is, contrary to the literature, heroes are standard and very useful part of modern open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The gig economy is quietly undermining a century of worker protections</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;No kid ever dreamed of growing up and driving for Uber or styling for Stitch Fix. In part, that’s because none of those companies existed when most of today’s adults were young. It’s also because, besides its much-touted “flexibility,” the gig economy isn’t much of a place to build a career. Instead, over the course of less than a decade, the self-described “tech companies” that connect people to gig work have managed to erode hard-fought labor protections in place for a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520300569/hustle-and-gig&quot;&gt;Hustle and Gig&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; to be published in March by University of California Press, sociologist Alexandrea Ravenelle interviews 80 gig workers who are struggling, striving, and succeeding. She analyzes their stories in the context of US employment history and concludes that “for all its app-enabled modernity, the gig economy resembles the early industrial age…the sharing economy is truly a movement forward to the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Although gig work was initially seen as a way to maximize worker freedom and create opportunities, it has, in its short history, proven corrosive. Ravenelle notes that a small percentage of people are making lots of money via side hustles, but they tend to be those who need it least. For example, she speaks to independent hoteliers in New York renting out rooms and apartments via AirBnB, including a corporate lawyer and a man with a chain of laundromats. Because they already had capital, have steady sources of income apart from their side gigs, and are willing to skirt rental laws, these two individuals are able to invest heavily in their “gigs” and create lucrative businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Sadly, those who most need to work can find themselves trapped in a cycle of struggle. Ravenelle interviewed men and women signed up to do tasks on Task Rabbit—prior to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/9/28/16377528/ikea-acquisition-taskrabbit-shopping-home-contract-labor&quot;&gt;acquisition by IKEA&lt;/a&gt;—and who drove for Uber, for example. They were not employees and so had no health insurance, workers’ compensation protections, employer contributions to Social Security and payroll taxes, paid time off, family leave protections, discrimination protections, or unemployment insurance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Sometimes, this gig work also requires an initial outlay of capital. (My own neighbor just traded in her old vehicle for a new car, taking on thousands of dollars in debt so that she can make extra money driving for Lyft.) At the very least, a potential worker needs a smartphone and wi-fi service. Ravanelle’s book boasts an image inside of a young man in a park panhandling for $30 to activate his phone service so that he can start picking up work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Workers take gigs as they come and can’t afford to be too picky, despite the supposed liberty of being your own boss in the sharing economy. Platform algorithms are designed to downgrade those who aren’t always available, making it ever-harder to pick up gigs. All this ends up putting workers in dangerous situations, working for strangers without any protections from their employers. Uber, for example, offers email communications to drivers, a service that is not nearly as responsive as the taxi cab dispatcher, say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;The workers Ravenelle spoke to were hit on at work while in a stranger’s house; injured after taking strenuous moving jobs; found themselves delivering questionable packages containing illegal substances; and drove passengers involved in shady activities, fearing that a protest or refusal would end in violence. In all of these awkward situations, these “independent contractors” were forced to choose between a slew of bad options. They could turn down work when they needed the money and risk finding themselves scrambling more. They could take questionable tasks and hope that it all worked out, which it sometimes did. But that meant exposing themselves to the risk that they would end up hurt and financially responsible for their on-the-job injuries, which would also mean needing unpaid time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;The availability of cheap labor also hasn’t escaped the notice of companies in need of a quick fix. Ravenelle spoke to workers who were doing manual labor, like filling coffee bags for a high-end roaster, that they picked up on an app. In other words,  businesses are also advertising tasks through the supposed peer-to-peer platforms, getting their temps through the new, cheaper system, rather than hiring workers directly. When Ikea acquired TaskRabbit in 2017, it was only making official a relationship that had been developing for years, as furniture buyers hired individuals to put together their Ikea designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7 quartz&quot;&gt;The costs of worker misclassification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Companies can make more money and incur a lot less liability classifying workers as independent contractors, so they do. Technically, by issuing a 1099 to a gig worker instead of a W2 to an employee, the business is financially and socially distanced from the worker. It’s cheaper and easier than employing everyone who works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But in the long run, Ravenelle argues, we will all lose as a result of this new structure. She notes that the government, and society as a whole, lose billions of dollars annually to worker misclassification, and writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_9f6a5 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel irony, workers in the sharing economy—hailed as the height of the modern workplace—find themselves without any of the worker protections enjoyed by their great-grandparents. Although workplace protections still exist for full-time and part-time employees, gig workers as independent contractors, are outside the social safety net of basic workplace protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;From California to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/lyft-drivers-sue-argue-that-theyre-employees-rather-than-contractors/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts,&lt;/a&gt; Uber and Lyft drivers, among others, have sued to be classified as employees. A California case was stymied in September when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Lyft drivers had agreed by contract to settle disputes through arbitration, meaning the court didn’t even need to reach the classification question. Worker status was outside the court’s purview, it found, because Uber created a contract that made it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But some drivers have opted out of the arbitration clause, and their cases may proceed. If they succeed in convincing the court they are employees and not contractors, this may signal the beginning of a much-needed reckoning with tech companies that have used the dated letter of the law to generate great profits at a cost to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7 quartz&quot;&gt;How the gig economy creates economic insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;There’s a hidden tax that corporations using contractors are paying for their cheap labor, so some companies see the upside of providing benefits. Ravenelle also speaks to founders who either switched from hiring contractors to employing workers, like the New York cleaning service MyClean, or decided doing so was the right thing to begin with, like the Hello Alfred errand-running service in Manhattan, which attempts to anticipate customer needs and therefore relies on a relationship between workers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;These companies argue that taking care of workers is good for business, although it does mean more administration and initial outlay. Loyal employees are happier, healthier, and do better work. They please customers and don’t need to be replaced or trained as often, which means business improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But these are rare examples, and their success is threatened by the existence of the many companies who abuse the system. Venture capitalists are more likely to pour money into businesses that can avoid employee liability, which makes it more difficult for responsible employers to compete. As Ravenelle notes, the “gig economy” is profoundly disrupting the deal between workers and businesses in the US, increasing economic insecurity and worker vulnerability and incentivizing investors and businesses to be bad social actors. She calls this “poor quality progress” that hides its regressive tendencies in friendly, unimpeachable language, terms like the “sharing economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;It’s an empty promise, the sociologist argues: “The disruption offered by the sharing economy is simply a hustle.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Machine Learning Books That Helped Me Level Up</title>
<link>http://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a Japanese word, &lt;em&gt;tsundoku&lt;/em&gt; (積ん読), which means buying and keeping a growing collection of books, even though you don’t really read them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we Developers and Data Scientists are particularly prone to falling into this trap. Personally, I even hoard bookmarks: my phone’s Chrome browser has so many open tabs, the counter was replaced with a “:D” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-249&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that zeal for &lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; most of us experience, we usually end up &lt;strong&gt;lost&lt;/strong&gt;, not sure of &lt;strong&gt;which book to pick up next&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s why today I’ll give you a very &lt;strong&gt;short list&lt;/strong&gt;: just 3 Machine Learning books, so that you won’t just bookmark it and forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these books has &lt;strong&gt;helped me immensely&lt;/strong&gt; in different stages of my &lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt; as a Data Scientist, particularly in my role as a Machine Learning Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;O’Reilly: Data Science from Scratch with Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=26ZMGLLYO1JYJ&amp;amp;keywords=data+science+from+scratch&amp;amp;qid=1556431957&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=data+science+from+,aps,284&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;linkId=607e7dd70b561ca2e59c8cc3c7d9c05c&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=149190142X&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=149190142X&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll review &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GQ4O7O&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; first, since it’s the most &lt;strong&gt;introductory&lt;/strong&gt; or broad one in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a very personal attachment to this book, since it’s the one that &lt;strong&gt;got me my job&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s right! I knew next to nothing about Data Science, even what Data Science was, before picking up this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have a pretty strong Probability and Statistics background, and knew enough Python to defend myself. However, I was missing the &lt;strong&gt;practical side&lt;/strong&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book did many things for me. It:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showed me how to &lt;strong&gt;process data in Python&lt;/strong&gt; efficiently and elegantly (following Python’s &lt;strong&gt;good practices&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught me how to &lt;strong&gt;implement&lt;/strong&gt; most simple &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showed me what the &lt;strong&gt;day-to-day job&lt;/strong&gt; of a Data Scientist may look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught me how to &lt;strong&gt;communicate my results&lt;/strong&gt; to others clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend it if you’re &lt;strong&gt;new to the Data Science community&lt;/strong&gt;. It will give you a clear overview of most topics you’ll need in order to start being a productive Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also showcase Python’s most commonly used libraries and expose you to a lot of &lt;strong&gt;idiomatic code&lt;/strong&gt;, which is always a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a link to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DDhIUH&quot;&gt;Data Science from Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1461471370&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZP93YS&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; is the most comprehensive &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning book&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve found so far. I learned a lot from it, from &lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; algorithms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/k-means-clustering-unsupervised-learning-for-recommender-systems/&quot;&gt;K-Means Clustering&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;strong&gt;Supervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; ones like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/xgboost-predicting-life-expectancy-with-supervised-learning/&quot;&gt;Boosted Trees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapters may feel a bit too introductory if you’re already working in this field (at least that was my experience). However, they also sum up many things you may not have learned in such an organized way before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later chapters are, however, where I think this book really shines. Its explanation of random forests, boosted trees and support vector machines are spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the topics you can learn from &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Statistical Learning&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt; Algorithms: from &lt;strong&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt;s to &lt;strong&gt;tree-based&lt;/strong&gt; methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; techniques: especially Clustering, including the K-Means algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sampling methods, and other general Machine Learning &lt;strong&gt;core concepts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meaning, advantages and disadvantages of &lt;strong&gt;metrics&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;accuracy, recall, precision&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this book has been my best read so far this year, and it’s made me into a more round up Data Scientist. I recommend it if you have a bit more experience, but want to &lt;strong&gt;polish your edges.&lt;/strong&gt; It is also a very good &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; book to keep on your shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows everything’s implementation in R, which I didn’t find particularly useful, but it didn’t hurt. You’ll probably import most of this code from SciKit learn anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, here’s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZP93YS&quot;&gt;Springer’s Introduction to Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio et al.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=3QTU6Y3VBDH1J&amp;amp;keywords=deep+learning&amp;amp;qid=1556432235&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=Deep+Learning,aps,288&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;linkId=3f50a1ee99315e32cc0afcf67d658d91&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0262035618&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0262035618&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2J0WjZe&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; blows my mind every time I open it. I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t really read it from start to finish. Yet.&lt;br/&gt;The only reason it’s the last one in the list is because of its very &lt;strong&gt;specific scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Artificial &lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However its first chapters, with an overview of Deep Learning’s &lt;strong&gt;precursors&lt;/strong&gt; and what makes it different, and then the explanation of &lt;strong&gt;how Deep Learning works&lt;/strong&gt;, are marvelous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even starts off by explaining everything you need to know &lt;strong&gt;before studying deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;, with whole chapters dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;linear algebra&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;probability&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;information theory&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;numerical computation&lt;/strong&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapters, which I’ve only partially read, serve as an awesome &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you need to dive deeper into a particular Neural Network &lt;strong&gt;architecture&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include in-depth explanations of &lt;strong&gt;Convolutional&lt;/strong&gt; Neural Networks and &lt;strong&gt;Recurrent&lt;/strong&gt; Neural Networks, along with many &lt;strong&gt;regularization&lt;/strong&gt; or optimization methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last section, which revolves around &lt;strong&gt;cutting-edge technology&lt;/strong&gt;, explains &lt;strong&gt;Generative models&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/autoencoder-deep-learning-tensorflow-eager-api-keras/&quot;&gt;Autoencoders&lt;/a&gt; and many other interesting algorithms. Adding them to your own toolkit will probably give you a great boost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this book are the &lt;strong&gt;rock stars&lt;/strong&gt; of Machine Learning right now. One of them even &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/27/geoffrey-hinton-yann-lecun-and-yoshua-bengio-honored-with-the-turing-award/&quot;&gt;won a Turing award&lt;/a&gt; recently, so I can’t think of better people to teach this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2J0WjZe&quot;&gt;Amazon link&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in the &lt;em&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/em&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from a broad, introductory book to an advanced, specific one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these Machine Learning books has had a profound impact in my career and, to some degree, the way I see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope at least some of them will have the same positive impact on your life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’ve already read, or are reading, any of them, tell me what you think of them in the comments! I’d love to discuss any of them further, especially the Deep Learning book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also discuss them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/strikingloo&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/@strikingloo&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.to/strikingloo&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested.&lt;br/&gt;I want to hear your opinions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(small disclaimer: all of these links are Amazon affiliate links, which means I get a small commission if you buy the books. However, I’ll only review books I’ve actually read, and have genuinely recommended to people in real life)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why isn&amp;#039;t 1 a prime number?</title>
<link>https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/why-isnt-1-a-prime-number/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/why-isnt-1-a-prime-number/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer friend of mine recently surprised me by saying he wasn’t sure whether the number 1 was prime or not. I was surprised because among mathematicians, 1 is universally regarded as non-prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion begins with this definition a person might give of “prime”: &lt;em&gt;a prime number is a positive whole number that is only divisible by 1 and itself&lt;/em&gt;. The number 1 is divisible by 1, and it’s divisible by itself. But &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; are not two distinct factors. Is 1 prime or not? When I write the definition of prime in an article, I try to remove that ambiguity by saying a prime number has exactly two distinct factors, 1 and itself, or that a prime is a whole number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. But why go to those lengths to exclude 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mathematical training taught me that the good reason for 1 not being considered prime is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every number can be written as a product of primes in exactly one way. If 1 were prime, we would lose that uniqueness. We could write 2 as 1×2, or 1×1×2, or 1&lt;sup&gt;594827&lt;/sup&gt;×2. Excluding 1 from the primes smooths that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan of how this article would go was that I would explain the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and be done with it. But it’s really not so hard to modify the statement of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to address the 1 problem, and after all, my friend’s question piqued my curiosity: how did mathematicians coalesce on this definition of prime? A cursory glance around some Wikipedia pages related to number theory turns up the assertion that 1 used to be considered prime but isn’t anymore. But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell1/cald5.pdf&quot;&gt;paper by Chris Caldwell and Yeng Xiong&lt;/a&gt; shows the history of the concept is a bit more complicated. I appreciated this sentiment from the beginning of their article: “First, whether or not a number (especially unity) is a prime is a matter of definition, so a matter of choice, context and tradition, not a matter of proof. Yet definitions are not made at random; these choices are bound by our usage of mathematics and, especially in this case, by our notation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caldwell and Xiong start with classical Greek mathematicians. They did not consider 1 to be a number in the same way that 2, 3, 4, and so on are numbers. 1 was considered a unit, and a number was composed of multiple units. For that reason, 1 couldn’t have been prime — it wasn’t even a number. Ninth-century Arab mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi&quot;&gt;al-Kindī&lt;/a&gt; wrote that it was not a number and therefore not even or odd. The view that 1 was the building block for all numbers but not a number itself lasted for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1585, Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin pointed out that when doing arithmetic in base 10, there is no difference between the digit 1 and any other digits. For all intents and purposes, 1 behaves the way any other magnitude does. Though it was not immediate, this observation eventually led mathematicians to treat 1 as a number, just like any other number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the end of the 19th century, some impressive mathematicians considered 1 prime, and some did not. As far as I can tell, it was not a matter that caused strife; for the most popular mathematical questions, the distinction was not terribly important. Caldwell and Xiong cite G. H. Hardy as the last major mathematician to consider 1 to be prime. (He explicitly included it as a prime in the first six editions of &lt;em&gt;A Course in Pure Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, which were published between 1908 and 1933. He updated the definition in 1938 to make 2 the smallest prime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article mentions but does not delve into some of the changes in mathematics that helped solidify the definition of prime and excluding 1. Specifically, one important change was the development of sets of numbers beyond the integers that behave somewhat like integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very most basic example, we can ask whether the number -2 is prime. The question may seem nonsensical, but it can motivate us to put into words the unique role of 1 in the whole numbers. The most unusual aspect of 1 in the whole numbers is that it has a multiplicative inverse that is also an integer. (A multiplicative inverse of the number &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is a number that when multiplied by &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; gives 1. The number 2 has a multiplicative inverse in the set of the rational or real numbers, 1/2: 1/2×2=1, but 1/2 is not an integer.) The number 1 happens to be its own multiplicative inverse. No other positive integer has a multiplicative inverse within the set of integers.* The property of having a multiplicative inverse is called being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(ring_theory)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number -1 is also a unit within the set of integers: again, it is its own multiplicative inverse. We don’t consider units to be either prime or composite because you can multiply them by certain other units without changing much. We can then think of the number -2 as not so different from 2; from the point of view of multiplication, -2 is just 2 times a unit. If 2 is prime, -2 should be as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assiduously avoided defining &lt;em&gt;prime&lt;/em&gt; in the previous paragraph because of an unfortunate fact about the definition of prime when it comes to these larger sets of numbers: it is wrong! Well, it’s not &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but it is a bit counterintuitive, and if I were the queen of number theory, I would not have chosen for the term to have the definition it does. In the positive whole numbers, each prime number &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; has two properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; cannot be written as the product of two whole numbers, neither of which is a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a product &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;×&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is divisible by &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; must be divisible by &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. (To check out what this property means on an example, imagine that &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;=10, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=6, and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these properties is what we might think of as a way to characterize prime numbers, but unfortunately the term for that property is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_element&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The second property is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_element&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;prime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of positive integers, of course, the same numbers satisfy both properties. But that isn’t true for every interesting set of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, let’s look at the set of numbers of the form &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;√-5, or &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;+i&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;√5, where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; are both integers and &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; is the square root of -1. If you multiply the numbers 1+√-5 and 1-√-5, you get 6. Of course, you also get 6 if you multiply 2 and 3, which are in this set of numbers as well, with b=0. Each of the numbers 2, 3, 1+√-5, and 1-√-5 cannot be broken down further and written as the product of numbers that are not units. (If you don’t take my word for it, it’s not too difficult to convince yourself.) But the product (1+√-5)(1-√-5) is divisible by 2, and 2 does not divide either 1+√-5 or 1-√-5. (Once again, you can prove it to yourself if you don’t believe me.) So 2 is irreducible, but it is not prime. In this set of numbers, 6 can be factored into irreducible numbers in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number set above, which mathematicians might call Z[√-5] (pronounced &quot;zee adjoin the square root of negative five&quot; or &quot;zed adjoin the square root of negative five, pip pip, cheerio&quot; depending on what you like to call the last letter of the alphabet), has two units, 1 and -1. But there are similar number sets that have an infinite number of units. As sets like this became objects of study, it makes sense that the definitions of unit, irreducible, and prime would need to be carefully delineated. In particular, if there are number sets with an infinite number of units, it gets more difficult to figure out what we mean by unique factorization of numbers unless we clarify that units cannot be prime. While I am not a math historian or a number theorist and would love to read more about exactly how this process took place before speculating further, I think this is one development Caldwell and Xiong allude to that motivated the exclusion of 1 from the primes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As happens so often, my initial neat and tidy answer for why things are the way they are ended up being only part of the story. Thanks to my friend for asking the question and helping me learn more about the messy history of primality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This sentence was edited after publication to clarify that no other positive integer has a multiplicative inverse that is also an integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that can be very hard indeed, especially when you have been doing something for so long that it has become routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us it might be societal addictions such as smoking, drinking, drugs, gambling – things that have now become normal in your life but aren’t doing you any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For others it might be work habits or just ‘things you do’ that, over time, have become routine and are now hard to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, it can be a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently learnt of a flying accident that so appalled my colleagues and I that it generated a discussion about if sometimes, what is described as an ‘accident’, should actually be defined as something that was more intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Accident (noun) – An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury.’ – Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;33.502328675981&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘accident’ involved a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfstream_IV&quot;&gt;Gulfstream IV&lt;/a&gt; business jet that crashed in Bedford, Massachusetts in 2014 after the experienced crew attempted to takeoff with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code7700.com/g450_gust_lock.html&quot;&gt;gust-lock&lt;/a&gt; engaged. The gust-lock is a device that locks the controls to prevent damage from the wind whilst the aircraft is parked. The take-off was rejected at a very late stage which meant that the aircraft departed the end of the runway and broke apart with the ensuing fire killing all onboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report’s Executive Summary concluded that the probable cause was the crew’s failure to perform a check of the flying control surfaces before take-off, their attempt to take-off with the gust-lock applied and their delayed actioning of the rejected take-off when they realised the controls were locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing factors included the flight crews habitual non-compliance with checklists. In fact five checklists had not been completed and it had become standard practice within the organisation to not do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the checklists had been done the gust-lock would have been removed prior to engine start and a full and free check of the controls would also have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To people who fly professionally, however, it is obvious that the report implies that the accident was caused by a theory called the ‘Normalisation of Deviance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term was first used by sociologist Diane Vaughan in her book on the Challenger Shuttle disaster ‘The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Social normalization of deviance means that people within the organization become so much accustomed to a deviant behaviour that they don’t consider it as deviant, despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for the elementary safety.’ – Diane Vaughan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer it goes on within an organisation, the more people become accustomed to it. People on the outside see it as abnormal but within the organisation it becomes accepted as everyday practise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the large size of some organisations it can be insidious and can also end up becoming more entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Diane Vaughan was invited to join the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and was duly able to demonstrate that NASA had not learnt from the earlier Challenger accident and had replicated its risk acceptance and slid towards normalisation of hazardous operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But after getting deeper into the data, it turned out the managers had not violated rules at all, but had actually conformed to all NASA requirements.  After analysis I realised that people conformed to ‘other rules’ than the regular procedures. They were conforming to the agency’s need to meet schedules, engineering rules about how to make decisions about risk.’ – Diane Vaughan on internal failings at NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;galleryImageBorder wsite-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/box2013.temp.domains/~fastjetp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8941852.jpg?w=1100&quot; alt=&quot;Picture&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsite-caption&quot;&gt;Jonathon Lowrie @jonathonlowrie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;102&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​NASA had formed and complied with its own expectations that were being slowly eroded as the need to get the shuttle flying again became more urgent – we can all see how this can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the Gulfstream accident report, the normalisation of deviance often results in an erosion of competency in which a culture of safety is slowly and gradually worn away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was something that I was acutely aware of when I was a Senior Supervisor on the largest fast-jet squadron in the RAF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a lot of my senior instructors were leaving the Squadron at the end of their tours, the temptation was to qualify less experienced instructors to teach the more complex phases, but much earlier than we had historically been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this caused us a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we didn’t qualify the junior instructors it would put excessive workload onto the experienced guys and increase the risk of an accident through fatigue. But if we did rush to qualify the junior instructors then the risk of an accident would be because of these newly qualified instructors’ inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t exactly a ‘win – win’ scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we had external agencies that we could turn to for guidance such as the RAF’s Central Flying School (CFS) and psychologists at the RAF Centre for Aviation Medicine (RAFCAM) and in the end, a compromise was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it’s too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 two of my friends were killed in flying incidents whilst serving with the Red Arrows Display Team. At the time, due to my background as an experienced Hawk T1 pilot (the same aircraft as the team flew), I was ordered to be on the Service Inquiry Panel and to be a Subject Matter Expert (SME) assisting in writing the final report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident I investigated was that of a friend of mine who had been killed whilst he was attempting to land after a display in Bournemouth. Although we found that the reason he crashed was predominantly medical, our report highlighted many areas where the Squadron was suffering from the ‘normalisation of deviance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the ‘normalisation of deviance’ is not only found within large organisations but also in tightly knit, small, unique units such as display teams and Special Forces units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because it is difficult for someone outside of these small units to have gained the experience and knowledge from within and so incredibly hard to understand if what the unit is doing is, indeed, ‘normal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once spoke to a member of a unit tasked with assessing flying standards across all RAF squadrons and he told me that, when assessing a Red Arrows pilot, he found himself upside down at 100 ft over RAF Scampton’s runway in formation with two other jets only a couple of feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How on earth was he supposed to know if this was normal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He couldn’t and he would have to use his own experience coupled with the advice of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once knew a Flight Commander on another squadron who felt that his men were ‘above’ external assessment and he alone should regulate and evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that sometimes assessment has to come partly from within the units themselves but external regulation and oversight should never be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the global financial crisis of 2008 when the economy collapsed because the banks hadn’t been properly regulated because they convinced the authorities that they could do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at it as someone you know telling you that you are developing a bad habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d all welcome the advice even if we didn’t actually &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the ‘normalisation of deviance’ can also be found with the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take alcohol and drug addiction. Once you start, it quickly becomes normal and often, in extremis, there is no &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; normality that can be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, though, it just leads down a path that ends up with someone doing something that is just plain stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was me when I almost crashed a Tornado GR4 in Belgium in the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/box2013.temp.domains/~fastjetp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8720726_orig.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;galleryImageBorder wsite-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/box2013.temp.domains/~fastjetp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8720726_orig.jpg?w=1100&quot; alt=&quot;Picture&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsite-caption&quot;&gt;Scott Hasti @Scotty2681&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;88&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a confident young front-line pilot and had been sent to undertake a multi-national flying exercise in northern Europe. We had two jets and the agreement between crews was that you keep the jet you were given, meaning no stealing jets – if yours breaks then you stay on the ground until it’s fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right up until mine broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been doing really well on the exercise. As a pair of bombers we had hit all of our targets and hadn’t been shot down by the ‘red air’ aircraft who were playing the enemy. So much so that, at the start of the second week, we were being purposely targeted so that the ‘enemy’ could claim that they’d shot down all of the nationalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the second week only one Tornado got airborne and it wasn’t mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our jet had a problem with the undercarriage or landing gear – it wouldn’t lock up under normal flight conditions; the wheels couldn’t be stowed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers had found significant and unfixable wear to the mechanical uplock. It would only lock up under 0g and this would mean that I would have to bunt the aircraft, nose down, towards the ground whilst selecting the gear ‘up’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to my Weapons System Officer (WSO) and we agreed to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got changed into our flight gear and, whilst the main exercise traffic were playing war over Northern Germany, we got airborne to try our engineer’s theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed the jet to 5,000 ft, pulled the nose up to 40 degrees, pushed to 0 g and selected the gear up. It takes about 10 seconds for the gear to travel and it has a normal limiting speed of 235 kts which we soon realised was not enough as we ended up 30 degrees nose down and very close to over-speeding the gear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at the Flight Reference Cards again; we would have to use the Never Exceed speed of 250 kt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally using the Never Exceed speed requires special approval but this was urgent so we felt that we could justify approving it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to get a few figures and parameters together and felt quite happy that, if we were careful, we could probably continue with the exercise the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked through our plan with the engineers and our buddies in the other Tornado and it all seemed quite reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud base was now only 4,000 ft and filled in up to 20,000 ft – we only had a limited space to perform the manoeuvre. If we managed it then we could carry on with the sortie, if not we’d have to burn 5 tonnes of fuel before we could land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got airborne, staying low with full reheat selected, then at 200 kts I pulled up to 40 degrees nose high, selected the flaps up and just below the cloud base, I pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the gear handle and moved it to ‘up’ – ‘Come on, Come on!’ I thought as the nose of the 25 tonne jet in full power slowly fell through the horizon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought the throttles back to idle. At slow speed the big jet didn’t manoeuvre very well and if the nose dropped too far it would not recover before we hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Clunk, Clunk*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gear was up and locked and as I brought the engines back up to full power I raised the nose to a climbing attitude. We had loads of time, we hadn’t even gone below 2,000 ft!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had worked. ​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;galleryImageBorder wsite-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/box2013.temp.domains/~fastjetp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3533023.jpg?w=1100&quot; alt=&quot;Picture&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wsite-caption&quot;&gt;Simon Strasdin @Simonstrasdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;164&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​Over the next few sorties we carried out the same procedure. We even managed to convince the Air Traffic Control tower that what we were doing was normal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they knew it wasn’t and people were starting to ask questions including an American F-16 pilot who was also on the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hey, what d’ya crazy guys doing with that ‘roller-coaster’ manoeuvre on take-off?’ he asked over some evening beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The gear won’t lock-up unless I unload the ‘g’.’ I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh, right – just looks really unusual in such a big jet especially with all that fuel onboard!’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just smiled, embarrassingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next couple of trips were also uneventful and our ‘roller-coaster manoeuvre’ became our normal way of departing the airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been asked to go and see the Programme Director and, as I was certain that it must be about our ‘roller-coaster’ departures, I was doing everything I could to avoid him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the exercise the weather was worse than any we had experienced in the previous two weeks but it was critical that we got home else we’d be stuck in Belgium for another weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the morning briefing we found that we had a cloud base of just 1,000 ft – the lowest yet and we would have to be very careful about getting the gear up today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got us airborne and, again, we stayed low. At 200 kts I pulled the nose up as hard as I could but I only really managed to get about 30 degrees before we entered cloud – this was new!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the bunt, leaving the engines in reheat to help hold the 0 g I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Come on gear!’ I heard my WSO call, followed quickly by ‘That’s 1,200 ft Tim.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were 20 degrees nose down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘COME ON!’ I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was looking tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘RECOVER!’, came the call from the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jet was now 40 degrees nose down and as we broke the cloud I could see that we were in a very bad place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were low on energy and the nose was rising too slowly to recover the aircraft before we would hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground Proximity Warning System sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘WOOP, WOOP – PULL UP, PULL UP!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘7, 6, 5 – that’s 400 ft Tim!’, called my WSO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jet was shuddering against my demands, it just didn’t have the performance to pull out of the dive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cockpit was silent. To make things worse, due to our high rate of descent, we were well outside of any ejection option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly selected full flap and slats to increase the lift over the wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden increase in lift meant that the nose started to pitch faster towards the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bad picture was starting to look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I levelled the jet at around 2-300 ft above the ground and gradually I climbed us back up into cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gear had never locked up. It was going be a long, and a very quiet, journey home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an experienced pilot but in the bracket where my over-confidence could well have been my downfall. The longer we’d continued performing the manoeuvre the more confident we’d become at doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had convinced ourselves that the rule breaking was for the benefit of the exercise and that what we were doing was essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’d almost destroyed a £50 million aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My actions in performing a zero ‘g’ bunt after take-off, in order to secure the gear, as outside of the rules as it was, had become the normal way to get airborne – I thought that what I was doing was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky that day but, just as my own personal deviance from normality had early warning signs, they are also there in all of the examples I’ve talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Red Arrows there had been accidents before in 2008 and 2010 with the loss of two aircraft. The squadron had a very unique way of operating and performed at a level that was exceptionally hard to assess to those outside of its culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASA had lost the shuttle Challenger, in 1986, through engineering complacency and had carried its flawed risk culture through to the Columbia missions and the loss of the shuttle on its return to earth in 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is well known that jet pilots start with a bag of luck and start to fill a bag of experience – most accidents happen around the 700 flying hours mark. When I almost flew into the Belgium landscape 10 years ago, I had 650.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you try and change the world just have a look at the foundation from which you are starting it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you significantly deviated from your own normality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say yours because everyone is different. We all have our own standards but, in all honesty, we often fall below them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the playing field level before you mark out the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe just concentrate on quitting the cigarettes before you decide to buy the £50 per month gym membership. Or stop the crisps and chocolates before you commit to the full Slim Fast plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know why the they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping others when flying out on holiday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you don’t take care of yourself first, you’re no help to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time for yourself, it’s not easy but you need to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I line my jet up on the runway I will always check that I have full and free controls, that there are no other aircraft on the final approach that might land on top of me and that the runway ahead is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also check that I have the correct flap selected and that my ejection seat is ‘live’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make sure that I have the fundamentals of flight secured before I go and attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if I take a bird into the engine and throw a compressor blade on take-off, well, at least I have given myself the best chance of dealing with that eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself, ‘What am I doing that is stopping me from being who I want to be?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can just concentrate on getting back to the fundamentals of ‘You’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Study finds Reddit’s ban of its most toxic subreddits worked (2017)</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/study-finds-reddits-controversial-ban-of-its-most-toxic-subreddits-actually-worked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/study-finds-reddits-controversial-ban-of-its-most-toxic-subreddits-actually-worked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;It seems like just the other day that Reddit finally &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/reddit-finally-bans-rcoontown-and-other-hateful-subreddits-updates-user-policies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;banned a handful of its most hateful and deplorable subreddits&lt;/a&gt;, including r/coontown and r/fatpeoplehate. The move was, at the time, derided by some as pointless, akin to shooing criminals away from one neighborhood only to trouble another. But a new study shows that, for Reddit at least, it has had lasting positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policing of hate speech online has become a flash point for many a flame war, these past few months especially, as white nationalists, neo-nazis and others with abhorrent but strictly speaking quite legal viewpoints struggle with being banned repeatedly from the internet’s biggest platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice has led sites like StormFront to seek shelter at dismal ports like off-brand hosts and small social networks pitching their tolerance of certain types of free speech being “censored” by others. It’s an example of one of the objections made to the idea of banning troublesome users or communities: they’ll just go elsewhere, so why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology took this question seriously, as until someone actually investigates whether such bans are helpful, harmful or some mix thereof, it’s all speculation. So they took a major corpus of Reddit data (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://pushshift.io/using-bigquery-with-reddit-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;compiled by PushShift.io&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;examined exactly what happened to the hate speech and purveyors thereof&lt;/a&gt;, with the two aforementioned subreddits as case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially they looked at the thousands of users that made up CT and FPH (as they call them) and quantified their hate speech usage. They then compared this pre-ban data to the same users post-ban: how much hate speech they produced, where they “migrated” to (i.e. duplicate subreddits, related ones, etc.) and whether “invaded” subreddits experienced spikes in hate speech as a result. Control groups were created by observing the activity of similar subreddits that weren’t banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1446876&quot; src=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;661&quot; height=&quot;412&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/altright_reddit.png?resize=50,31 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What they found was encouraging for this strategy of reducing unwanted activity on a site like Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post-ban, hate speech by the same users was reduced by as much as 80-90 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Members of banned communities left Reddit at significantly higher rates than control groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration was common, both to similar subreddits (i.e. overtly racist ones) and tangentially related ones (r/The_Donald).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, within those communities, hate speech did not reliably increase, although there were slight bumps as the invaders encountered and tested new rules and moderators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, the researchers conclude, the ban was quite effective at what it set out to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the definition of “work” framed by our research questions, the ban worked for Reddit. It succeeded at both a user level and a community level. Through the banning of subreddits which engaged in racism and fat-shaming, Reddit was able to reduce the prevalence of such behavior on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not so simple as all that. Naturally, many of the users who previously spewed racial slurs at CT just moved over to Gab or Voat, where their behavior is proudly fostered. But the point of the bans at Reddit wasn’t to eliminate racism; it was to discourage it on the platform. To that end, it accomplished its goal (I’ve asked Reddit what it thinks of the study and its conclusions). And similar strategies may work for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of how to to combat racism and hatred at large is one that is really too much for a major platform like Reddit &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/30/manufacturing-civility/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;or even Google or Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The best they can hope to do is strike at it when and where it appears. But as ineffective as that might seem, it worked for Reddit and it may work elsewhere: bigotry is easy and those who cherish it are lazy. Make it difficult and many people may find it more trouble than it’s worth to harass, shame, and otherwise abuse online those different from themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>It seems like just the other day that Reddit finally banned a handful of its most hateful and deplorable subreddits, including r/coontown and r/fatpeoplehate. The move was, at the time, derided by some as pointless, akin to shooing criminals away from one neighborhood only to trouble another. But a…</og:description>

<title>The inception bar: a new phishing method</title>
<link>https://jameshfisher.com/2019/04/27/the-inception-bar-a-new-phishing-method/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jameshfisher.com/2019/04/27/the-inception-bar-a-new-phishing-method/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to HSBC, the world’s seventh-largest bank! Of course, the page you’re reading isn’t actually hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hsbc.com&lt;/code&gt;; it’s hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jameshfisher.com&lt;/code&gt;. But when you visit this page on Chrome for mobile and scroll a little way, the page is able to display itself as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hsbc.com&lt;/code&gt; - and worse, the page is able to jail you in this fake browser! In this post I show how the attack works, then suggest some ways Chrome can fix this vulnerability, then finally show you how to get out if you’re still stuck here. But first, the proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6ada7ab7247e7927279c44f76470423f5ec2c97d/322b8/assets/2019-04-27/proof.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chrome for mobile, when the user scrolls down, the browser hides the URL bar, and hands the URL bar’s screen space to the web page. Because the user associates this screen space with “trustworthy browser UI”, a phishing site can then use it to pose as a different site, by displaying its own fake URL bar - the inception bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is bad, but it gets worse. Normally, when the user scrolls up, Chrome will re-display the true URL bar. But we can trick Chrome so that it never re-displays the true URL bar! Once Chrome hides the URL bar, we move the entire page content into a “scroll jail” - that is, a new element with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;overflow:scroll&lt;/code&gt;. Then the user &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; they’re scrolling up in the page, but in fact they’re only scrolling up in the scroll jail! Like a dream in &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, the user believes they’re in their own browser, but they’re actually in a browser within their browser. Here’s a video of the hack in use:&lt;/p&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;p&gt;But it gets even worse! Even with the above “scroll jail”, the user should be able to scroll to the top of the jail, at which point Chrome will re-display the URL bar. But we can disable this behavior, too! We insert a very tall padding element at the top of the scroll jail. Then, if the user tries to scroll into the padding, we scroll them back down to the start of the content! It looks like a page refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my proof-of-concept, I’ve just screenshotted Chrome’s URL bar on the HSBC website, then inserted that into this webpage. With a little more effort, the page could detect which browser it’s in, and forge an inception bar for that browser. With yet more effort, the inception bar could be made interactive. Even if the user isn’t fooled by the current page, you can get another try after the user enters “gmail.com” in the inception bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a serious security flaw? Well, even I, as the creator of the inception bar, found myself accidentally using it! So I can imagine this technique fooling users who are less aware of it, and who are less technically literate. The only time the user has the opportunity to verify the true URL is on page load, before scrolling the page. After that, there’s not much escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you guard yourself against this attack? I don’t really know. I see it as a security flaw in Chrome. But what’s the fix? There’s a trade-off, between maximizing screen space on one hand, and retaining trusted screen space on the other. One compromise would be for Chrome to retain a small amount of screen space above &lt;a href=&quot;https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/&quot;&gt;the “line of death”&lt;/a&gt; instead of giving up literally &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; screen space to the web page. Chrome could use this spage to signal that “the URL bar is currently collapsed”, e.g. by displaying the shadow of an almost-hidden URL bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to keep you any longer. If you’re still stuck here, one way to get out is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19768072&quot;&gt;go to the Hacker News discussion and upvote this article&lt;/a&gt;. Or, for hacks similar to this one, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://feross.org/html5-fullscreen-api-attack/&quot;&gt;this inception attack based on the fullscreen API&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://jameshfisher.github.io/cursory-hack/&quot;&gt;my “custom cursor” inception attack from 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I draw figures for my mathematical lecture notes using Inkscape</title>
<link>https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/#</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1&quot;&gt;pre­vi­ous blog&lt;/a&gt; post, I ex­plained how I take lec­ture notes using Vim and LaTeX. In this post, I’ll talk about how I draw fig­ures for my notes using Inkscape and about my cus­tom short­cut man­ag­er.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some ex­am­ples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me show you some ex­am­ples of fig­ures I’ve made. They were made for com­plex analy­sis, dif­fer­en­tial geom­e­try, elec­tro­dy­nam­ics and my bach­e­lors’s the­sis on el­lip­tic curves. I drew them dur­ing the lec­ture — ex­cept of course those for my the­sis — using Inkscape, so let’s start with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/d38ee/fig_1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Example 1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/14883/fig_1.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/3f2fd/fig_1.png 170w, /static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/dd39f/fig_1.png 340w, /static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/14883/fig_1.png 680w, /static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/5ce4e/fig_1.png 1020w, /static/df84ee6b3a0f2016b1aa37a79deab7c0/d38ee/fig_1.png 1324w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/ba976/fig_3.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Example 2&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/14883/fig_3.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/3f2fd/fig_3.png 170w, /static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/dd39f/fig_3.png 340w, /static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/14883/fig_3.png 680w, /static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/5ce4e/fig_3.png 1020w, /static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/55fdf/fig_3.png 1360w, /static/3eacd85683a5d2cdd10e7f6b2a281d86/ba976/fig_3.png 1432w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/dd64d/fig_6.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Example 3&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/14883/fig_6.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/3f2fd/fig_6.png 170w, /static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/dd39f/fig_6.png 340w, /static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/14883/fig_6.png 680w, /static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/5ce4e/fig_6.png 1020w, /static/8353ffee383e88481e3533874c18a40e/dd64d/fig_6.png 1251w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/3341a/fig_5.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Example 4&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/14883/fig_5.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/3f2fd/fig_5.png 170w, /static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/dd39f/fig_5.png 340w, /static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/14883/fig_5.png 680w, /static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/5ce4e/fig_5.png 1020w, /static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/55fdf/fig_5.png 1360w, /static/9a7e08c455f98a30e210b3e3a4953fb1/3341a/fig_5.png 1414w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/73f93/fig_2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Example 5&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/14883/fig_2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/3f2fd/fig_2.png 170w, /static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/dd39f/fig_2.png 340w, /static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/14883/fig_2.png 680w, /static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/5ce4e/fig_2.png 1020w, /static/14cd3152abeb915eebabcfa2e3aeac8c/73f93/fig_2.png 1212w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Inkscape?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inkscape.org/&quot;&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt; is an open source vec­tor graph­ics ed­i­tor, avail­able for all major plat­forms. It’s a free — but ar­guably less fea­ture­ful — al­ter­na­tive to Adobe Il­lus­tra­tor. You can use it for de­sign­ing fly­ers and logos like in the pic­ture below, but it’s also a pow­er­ful tool for draw­ing math­e­mat­i­cal fig­ures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/7bf32/inkscape.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Inkscape&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/14883/inkscape.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/3f2fd/inkscape.png 170w, /static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/dd39f/inkscape.png 340w, /static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/14883/inkscape.png 680w, /static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/5ce4e/inkscape.png 1020w, /static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/55fdf/inkscape.png 1360w, /static/0da7559609e3a938b43ee18d7ca7d958/7bf32/inkscape.png 1606w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Inkscape?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most com­mon so­lu­tions for adding fig­ures to LaTeX doc­u­ments are Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z, PSTricks and As­ymp­tote. These op­tions have one thing in com­mon: they are com­mand based, i.e. you just write some code that spec­i­fies how the fig­ure should be drawn. For ex­am­ple, the fol­low­ing Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;latex&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;tikzpicture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\coordinate&lt;/span&gt; (A) at (1, 3);
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;thick, -&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; (0, 0) -- (A);
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;above right&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; at (A) &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token equation string&quot;&gt;$A = (1, 2)$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;tikzpicture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gives this fig­ure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/54cd8/tikzexample4.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;TikZ example&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/14883/tikzexample4.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/3f2fd/tikzexample4.png 170w, /static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/dd39f/tikzexample4.png 340w, /static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/14883/tikzexample4.png 680w, /static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/5ce4e/tikzexample4.png 1020w, /static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/55fdf/tikzexample4.png 1360w, /static/4c2942fceb15c07c3e937135c552e754/54cd8/tikzexample4.png 1437w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ben­e­fit of these pack­ages is that draw­ing a fig­ure is a lot like pro­gram­ming: you can use vari­ables, do cal­cu­la­tions, use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops, etc. Fur­ther­more fig­ures blend in nice­ly in your doc­u­ment be­cause all text is type­set by LaTeX it­self. This means that you can type­set math ef­fort­less­ly, or that if later on, you de­cide to change the font of your doc­u­ment, all the fig­ures will change au­to­mat­i­cal­ly to match the new font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How­ev­er, these as­sets cost you vi­su­al feed­back and speed. Draw­ing com­plex fig­ures is in­her­ent­ly a graph­i­cal task and with­out a graph­i­cal in­ter­face, it can be ex­treme­ly time con­sum­ing. It’s im­pos­si­ble to click and drag an ob­ject to move it, free­hand draw a curve or drag the con­trol points of a Bézier curve. This makes Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z a lot hard­er and slow­er to use than Inkscape. While I use Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z once in a while for com­plex fig­ures, I found that in most cases, the ben­e­fits of Inkscape far out­weigh those of Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z, es­pe­cial­ly if you’re under time pres­sure dur­ing a lec­ture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this out of the way, let’s get start­ed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In­clud­ing Inkscape fig­ures in a LaTeX doc­u­ment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z, Inkscape has the op­tion to ren­der the text of a fig­ure using LaTeX. For this, it ex­ports fig­ures as both a pdf and a LaTeX file. The pdf doc­u­ment con­tains the fig­ure with text stripped, and the LaTeX file con­tains the code need­ed to place the text at the cor­rect po­si­tion. For ex­am­ple, sup­pose you’re work­ing on the fol­low­ing fig­ure in Inkscape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/6b359/riemman-inkscape.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Riemann's theorem&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/14883/riemman-inkscape.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/3f2fd/riemman-inkscape.png 170w, /static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/dd39f/riemman-inkscape.png 340w, /static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/14883/riemman-inkscape.png 680w, /static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/5ce4e/riemman-inkscape.png 1020w, /static/c21062130180ff44b3bca5b48bf35b90/6b359/riemman-inkscape.png 1110w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To in­clude this fig­ure in a LaTeX doc­u­ment, you’d go to File › Save As, se­lect ‘pdf’ as the ex­ten­sion and then press Save which makes the fol­low­ing di­a­log pop up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/1f4576e71da68bcf723d4b75a264dd8b/5c2ce/saveas.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;saveas&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/1f4576e71da68bcf723d4b75a264dd8b/5c2ce/saveas.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/1f4576e71da68bcf723d4b75a264dd8b/b8a85/saveas.png 170w, /static/1f4576e71da68bcf723d4b75a264dd8b/55eea/saveas.png 340w, /static/1f4576e71da68bcf723d4b75a264dd8b/5c2ce/saveas.png 422w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choos­ing ‘Omit text in pdf and cre­ate LaTeX file’, will save the fig­ure as pdf+LaTeX. To in­clude these Inkscape fig­ures in your LaTeX doc­u­ment, you can add the fol­low­ing code to your pre­am­ble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;latex&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;xifthen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;pdfpages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\usepackage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\newcommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\incfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\svgwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\columnwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;./figures/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;#1.pdf_tex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As­sum­ing the fig­ure is lo­cat­ed at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;figures/riemmans-theorem.svg&lt;/code&gt;, it can sim­ply be in­clud­ed with fol­low­ing code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;latex&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-latex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;ht&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\centering&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\incfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;riemmans-theorem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\caption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;Riemmans theorem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fig:riemmans-theorem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function selector&quot;&gt;\end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Com­pil­ing your doc­u­ment, you’d get the fol­low­ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/0e110/latexrendered1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Rendered figure&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/14883/latexrendered1.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/3f2fd/latexrendered1.png 170w, /static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/dd39f/latexrendered1.png 340w, /static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/14883/latexrendered1.png 680w, /static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/5ce4e/latexrendered1.png 1020w, /static/f08abb93e49bbeb6982f0a6ef449790c/0e110/latexrendered1.png 1052w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the text is ren­dered by LaTeX which makes the fig­ure blend in beau­ti­ful­ly. When you later de­cide to change the font, it gets up­dat­ed ac­cord­ing­ly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/7ef41/latexrendered2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Rendered figure with different font&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/14883/latexrendered2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/3f2fd/latexrendered2.png 170w, /static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/dd39f/latexrendered2.png 340w, /static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/14883/latexrendered2.png 680w, /static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/5ce4e/latexrendered2.png 1020w, /static/4032779787b17efc62bfd5446e2f73f7/7ef41/latexrendered2.png 1061w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup al­lows you to draw fig­ures in Inkscape, while still hav­ing the power of LaTeX for type­set­ting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cre­at­ing and in­clud­ing fig­ures quick­ly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m tak­ing notes dur­ing a lec­ture, I need to be able to add a fig­ure with­out dis­rupt­ing my flow, and not spend time open­ing Inkscape, search­ing for the cor­rect di­rec­to­ry, typ­ing the LaTeX code for in­clud­ing the fig­ure man­u­al­ly and so on. To avoid this, I added some short­cuts to Vim for man­ag­ing my fig­ures. For ex­am­ple, when I type the title of the fig­ure I want to cre­ate and press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+F&lt;/kbd&gt;, the fol­low­ing hap­pens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The script finds the fig­ures di­rec­to­ry de­pend­ing on the lo­ca­tion of the LaTeX root file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then it checks if a fig­ure with the same name ex­ists. If so, the script does noth­ing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, my fig­ure tem­plate gets copied to the fig­ures di­rec­to­ry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cur­rent line which con­tains the fig­ure title gets re­placed with the LaTeX code to in­clude the fig­ure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new fig­ure opens in Inkscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A file watch­er is set up such that when­ev­er the fig­ure is saved as an svg file by press­ing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl + S&lt;/kbd&gt;, it also gets saved as pdf+LaTeX. This means that the an­noy­ing pdf save di­a­log we’ve dis­cussed be­fore doesn’t pop up any­more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;See it in ac­tion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/including_figure-a48c6ef9b7407f13e4e0e86b2649333f.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Adding a figure&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want to edit a fig­ure, I can press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+F&lt;/kbd&gt; in nor­mal mode to open a se­lec­tion di­a­log that al­lows me to search for fig­ures in the cur­rent doc­u­ment. Upon se­lect­ing one, it shows me the fig­ure in Inkscape. When I save the fig­ure, the code for in­clud­ing it is copied to the clip­board. This way, I can rein­clude it if I delet­ed the orig­i­nal code to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/editing_figure-6f6ff7a6c0d74474ae9177369c8392a9.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Editing a figure&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These short­cuts make adding and open­ing fig­ures a breeze. I don’t have to re­mem­ber sav­ing fig­ures as pdf+LaTeX, pick the right di­rec­to­ry or write the code need­ed for in­clud­ing the fig­ure. The bar­ri­er to add a new fig­ure is much lower than if I’d have to do those things man­u­al­ly. You can find my script for man­ag­ing fig­ures &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve ex­plained how I man­age my fig­ures, I’d like to talk about ac­tu­al­ly &lt;em&gt;draw­ing&lt;/em&gt; fig­ures in Inkscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Draw­ing fig­ures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While draw­ing fig­ures in Inkscape is quite a bit faster than using Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z in most cases, it is still slow­er than draw­ing them by hand. Using the built-​in short­cuts of Inkscape speeds up the process but it still doesn’t hit the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There­fore, I de­cid­ed to pro­gram a cus­tom short­cut man­ag­er in Python which al­lows me to in­ter­cept all key­board events be­fore they reach Inkscape. This way, I have full con­trol over how every key­stroke gets in­ter­pret­ed, giv­ing me a lot of flex­i­bil­i­ty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Draw­ing shapes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the built in key­board short­cuts of Inkscape. For ex­am­ple, &lt;kbd&gt;r&lt;/kbd&gt; ac­ti­vates the rec­tan­gle draw­ing tool, &lt;kbd&gt;e&lt;/kbd&gt; draws el­lipses, etc. Implementation-​wise, this means that the short­cut man­ag­er will ‘re­play’ these key­board events, i.e. it’ll just pass them through to Inkscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How­ev­er, in­stead of the de­fault short­cuts &lt;kbd&gt;p&lt;/kbd&gt; for pen­cil and &lt;kbd&gt;b&lt;/kbd&gt; for the Bézier tool, I use &lt;kbd&gt;w&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt;, as these are a bit more com­fort­able to reach while using a mouse with my right hand. In the spir­it of mak­ing short­cuts left hand­ed, I also mapped &lt;kbd&gt;z&lt;/kbd&gt; to undo, &lt;kbd&gt;Shift+z&lt;/kbd&gt; to delete, and &lt;kbd&gt;x&lt;/kbd&gt; to tog­gle snap­ping which is nor­mal­ly the hard to reach &lt;kbd&gt;%&lt;/kbd&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key chords to apply com­mon­ly used styles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Styling ob­jects is the sec­ond most com­mon thing I do in Inkscape. The styles I use for draw­ing fig­ures are quite sim­ple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shapes e.g. rec­tan­gles or cir­cles are most­ly black, light gray, white or trans­par­ent and op­tion­al­ly have a stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lines (in­clud­ing strokes) are most­ly solid, dot­ted or dashed. They can be (very) thick or have a nor­mal width and op­tion­al­ly have an arrow on ei­ther side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These op­tions com­bined give the fol­low­ing table of com­mon­ly used styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/ac5b8/default-styles-names2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Table of common styles&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/14883/default-styles-names2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/3f2fd/default-styles-names2.png 170w, /static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/dd39f/default-styles-names2.png 340w, /static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/14883/default-styles-names2.png 680w, /static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/5ce4e/default-styles-names2.png 1020w, /static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/55fdf/default-styles-names2.png 1360w, /static/035512f7f15d2a082fc7508431161472/ac5b8/default-styles-names2.png 2035w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ap­ply­ing these styles is some­thing I do very fre­quent­ly, I want it to be fast, but using the de­fault short­cuts in Inkscape takes too long. For ex­am­ple, sup­pose you’d like to change the style of some ob­jects as fol­lows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/dc1bb/inkscape-before-after.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Changing styles&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/14883/inkscape-before-after.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/3f2fd/inkscape-before-after.png 170w, /static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/dd39f/inkscape-before-after.png 340w, /static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/14883/inkscape-before-after.png 680w, /static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/5ce4e/inkscape-before-after.png 1020w, /static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/55fdf/inkscape-before-after.png 1360w, /static/31aa1c6db3c76cd3e089b65c569bf4d6/dc1bb/inkscape-before-after.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+Shift+F&lt;/kbd&gt; to open the styles panel, and up­date the style of each ob­ject by click­ing be­cause you can’t do this using key­board short­cuts in Inkscape. This is tire­some. Ide­al­ly, it should only take a frac­tion of a sec­ond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/inkscape-editing-863913dd071183ce203e5f34db5641b7.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Using Inkscape's default shortcuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;em&gt;key chords&lt;/em&gt; come into play. A key chord is a key­board short­cut which con­sists of two or more si­mul­ta­ne­ous key­strokes. For ex­am­ple, when I press &lt;kbd&gt;s&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt; si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly, my short­cut man­ag­er will apply a solid stroke and a grey fill to the cur­rent se­lec­tion. When I want the stroke to be thick, I press &lt;kbd&gt;s&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;g&lt;/kbd&gt; to­geth­er, where &lt;kbd&gt;g&lt;/kbd&gt; stands for thick (as the &lt;kbd&gt;t&lt;/kbd&gt; key is hard to reach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, every styling prop­er­ty cor­re­sponds to a key: &lt;kbd&gt;s&lt;/kbd&gt; stands for nor­mal stroke, &lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt; for gray fill, &lt;kbd&gt;g&lt;/kbd&gt; for thick, &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; for arrow, &lt;kbd&gt;d&lt;/kbd&gt; for dot­ted, &lt;kbd&gt;e&lt;/kbd&gt; for dashed, etc. Here’s the full table of pos­si­ble op­tions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/ac5b8/default-styles-keys2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Table of common styles with keyboard shortcuts added&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/14883/default-styles-keys2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/3f2fd/default-styles-keys2.png 170w, /static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/dd39f/default-styles-keys2.png 340w, /static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/14883/default-styles-keys2.png 680w, /static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/5ce4e/default-styles-keys2.png 1020w, /static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/55fdf/default-styles-keys2.png 1360w, /static/d6340105c5f1f48d6bbbe4ca4d1e7e48/ac5b8/default-styles-keys2.png 2035w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some styles in this table core­spond to only one key, e.g. the style in the top left cor­ner: filled in gray with­out a stroke. This could present a prob­lem, as only press­ing &lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt; gets you the Bézier tool. The so­lu­tion is to press &lt;kbd&gt;Space&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt; where &lt;kbd&gt;Space&lt;/kbd&gt; acts like a place­hold­er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these key chords, the pre­vi­ous prob­lem can be solved in a few key­strokes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;s&lt;/kbd&gt; makes the rectangle gray and gives it solid border.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;f&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;e&lt;/kbd&gt; stands for 'filled and very thickly dashed'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;g&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;d&lt;/kbd&gt; adds an arrow and makes the line thickly dotted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/fast-editing-inkscape-ead30330292ec820d614b2ef69a0f907.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Fast styling using custom shortcuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An­oth­er im­por­tant part of mak­ing fig­ures is adding text. As fig­ures often in­clude math­e­mat­i­cal for­mu­las, I want to be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1&quot;&gt;my snip­pets&lt;/a&gt; in Vim. To en­sure this, I can press &lt;kbd&gt;t&lt;/kbd&gt; which opens a small Vim win­dow where I can type LaTeX. When I quit, a text node is in­sert­ed in Inkscape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/latex-as-text-ca4e1ad5e470b77c905ac3c004e2fd77.gif&quot; alt=&quot;LaTeX as text&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I cov­ered be­fore, this text will be ren­dered by LaTeX when I in­sert the fig­ure in a doc­u­ment. How­ev­er, some­times I want to ren­der some LaTeX im­me­di­ate­ly, which I can do with &lt;kbd&gt;Shift+T&lt;/kbd&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/latex-as-svg-51080ce34ccfb23e55eee8b599c116ee.gif&quot; alt=&quot;LaTeX as svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these op­tions have their ad­van­tages and dis­ad­van­tages. I main­ly use the first method be­cause the text is ren­dered by the LaTeX doc­u­ment. This means the font will al­ways match and that you can use macros de­fined in the pre­am­ble of your doc­u­ment. A dis­ad­van­tage how­ev­er is that po­si­tion­ing of text is some­times a bit dif­fi­cult. As you don’t see the final re­sult in Inkscape, it some­times re­quires some hop­ping from Inkscape to my pdf view­er and back to fine-​tune the re­sults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sav­ing and using less com­mon­ly used styles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the key chord styles suf­fice 90% of the time, I some­times want to use a cus­tom style. For ex­am­ple, to draw op­tics di­a­grams it’s use­ful to have a glass and a ray style. To achieve this, I first have to cre­ate the style in Inkscape using the de­fault short­cuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/04fb1/custom-style-1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Creating the style with default shortcuts&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/14883/custom-style-1.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/3f2fd/custom-style-1.png 170w, /static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/dd39f/custom-style-1.png 340w, /static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/14883/custom-style-1.png 680w, /static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/5ce4e/custom-style-1.png 1020w, /static/df9e44dc3e366a78861e78fca711b97d/04fb1/custom-style-1.png 1218w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save these styles, I se­lect one of these ob­jects and press &lt;kbd&gt;Shift + s&lt;/kbd&gt;. Then I type the name of the new style, in this case, ‘glass’ and press enter to con­firm. Now this style is saved and I can use it later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I se­lect an ob­ject, press &lt;kbd&gt;s&lt;/kbd&gt; and type ‘glass’, the cor­re­spond­ing style will be ap­plied to the ob­ject. How­ev­er, it’s not nec­es­sary to type the full name be­cause style gets ap­plied im­me­di­ate­ly when there an unique style match­ing the typed char­ac­ters so far. For ex­am­ple, if I’d have only one style start­ing with ‘g’, typ­ing ‘g’ would be enough to apply the style. If you’d have mul­ti­ple styles, ‘gl’ or maybe even ‘gla’ would be nec­es­sary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The an­noy­ing thing about this is that when­ev­er you type too many char­ac­ters — i.e. sup­pose typ­ing ‘gl’ would apply the style, but you’ve typed ‘gla’ — the re­main­ing keys, in this case &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; would be in­ter­pret­ed as an­oth­er com­mand, which would give un­in­tend­ed re­sults. There­fore, the short­cut man­ag­er waits 500 ms be­fore it goes back to the de­fault mode. This is enough time for a human to see that the style has been ap­plied and to stop typ­ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/custom-style-2-2cee8b968a68a5db3018d72966cad8be.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Applying custom styles&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding and sav­ing ob­jects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final el­e­ment of my setup is adding and sav­ing ob­jects. I can add them with &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; and save them with &lt;kbd&gt;Shift+a&lt;/kbd&gt;. For ex­am­ple, press­ing &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; and typ­ing ‘ec’ adds an el­lip­tic curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/d23df/objects-elliptic.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Elliptic curve&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/14883/objects-elliptic.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/3f2fd/objects-elliptic.png 170w, /static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/dd39f/objects-elliptic.png 340w, /static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/14883/objects-elliptic.png 680w, /static/4c0162d9696c7b3354340dc070fa200c/d23df/objects-elliptic.png 761w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an­oth­er ex­am­ple, press­ing &lt;kbd&gt;a&lt;/kbd&gt; and typ­ing ‘dg’ adds a ‘key­hole’ (‘dg’ is the mir­ror image of ‘kh’ on the key­board). I can use &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+-&lt;/kbd&gt; to sub­tract it from a given shape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://castel.dev/keyhole2-7b677b963dca0e683aa35f892d6b73fa.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Keyhole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other ex­am­ples are blobs and 2D, 3D axis, which I’ve used quite fre­quent­ly in com­plex analy­sis and dif­fer­en­tial geom­e­try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/dacf3/objects-examples2.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-background-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;A blob and 2D, 3D axis&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://castel.dev/static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/14883/objects-examples2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/3f2fd/objects-examples2.png 170w, /static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/dd39f/objects-examples2.png 340w, /static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/14883/objects-examples2.png 680w, /static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/5ce4e/objects-examples2.png 1020w, /static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/55fdf/objects-examples2.png 1360w, /static/cc13b6c4c274ff9f7c42da28ac193461/dacf3/objects-examples2.png 1638w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try this out for your­self, you can find both my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures&quot;&gt;script for man­ag­ing fig­ures in Vim&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-shortcut-manager&quot;&gt;Inkscape short­cut man­ag­er&lt;/a&gt; on Github. Both scripts only work on Linux-​based sys­tems. The first script should work out of the box, the sec­ond one prob­a­bly won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Con­clu­sion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Inkscape, draw­ing fig­ures for ar­ti­cles, books and pre­sen­ta­tions is a breeze. They look pro­fes­sion­al and blend in nice­ly in your doc­u­ment. While it’s slow­er than draw­ing them by hand, it’s faster than Ti&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;Z in most cases. My cus­tom short­cuts and my script for man­ag­ing fig­ures in Vim make it even faster, al­low­ing me to draw fig­ures dur­ing lec­tures.&lt;/p&gt;
