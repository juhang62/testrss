<title>On Internal Engineering Practices at Amazon</title>
<link>https://jatins.gitlab.io/me/amazon-internal-tools/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jatins.gitlab.io/me/amazon-internal-tools/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I should start with a side note about the title of this post. I initially called this &quot;Why do internal tools at Amazon suck?&quot; as that sounded better for eye grab while posting on HN. But then I realized that'd be a bit overly critical and unfair to the teams that work so hard on internal tools. However, This article is a mix about internal tools, engineering practices and culture. So, it touches on more things than the title suggests.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently talking to a college friend. He had called me to wish me on my birthday. He had recently joined Amazon. I asked him about how he was finding Amazon and there were a couple things he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;There internal tooling is sophisticated and great, but people are ruthless here&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about how his first deliverable didn't go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I took 2 hours to code the whole thing, but then the getting it from my machine to actually deploying, and getting it to run on servers took forever.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as someone who worked at Amazon for 2 years right after college, it completely resonated with me. Yes, there is a general lack of empathy in the culture that has been written fairly extensively about, so let's talk about what most people expect to be good inside Amazon - the tech part - their internal tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends who are there, describe the internal tooling as &quot;sophisticated&quot;. I think a part of that comes from Amazon being their first and only job, so they don't have much to compare it with. And since as an Amazon SDE, you are mostly working with internal tools, it can be easy to lose track in the developments of outside tech ecosystem, unless you spend 4 hours a day on Hacker News. (&quot;Kubernetes? What's that? I am sure Apollo is better&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when I hear them call it &quot;sophisticated&quot;, I think somewhere they are saying &quot;It's complicated, so it's gotta be good. I must be dumb to not get it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;exhibit-a-deployments&quot;&gt;Exhibit A: Deployments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their internal deployment tool at Amazon is Apollo, and it doesn't support auto-scaling. So, everytime around &quot;peak&quot;, we had a peak scaling exercise, where you manually provision more hosts (you order them, and then wait for approval, you can't just click a button like you'd in AWS). At the end of it, you get a T-shirt saying &quot;I survived peak&quot;, which should ideally say &quot;I survived shitty engineering practices.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rest of industry was promoting Infrastructure as code, we used to manually recreate environments in 4 different regions, manually copy Apollo configurations. Imagine a shiny eyed CS grad, keeping two tabs open and copy pasting things from one to other. The entire thing was so error prone, but still it was the standard way of doing things. This should be an interview exercise rather that stupid rotate the array questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There used to sprint time allocated to this shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;One time, during the standup, a guy mentioned that he spent around 1 hour on deployment yesterday and his manager asked &quot;Well, what were you doing when the deployment was happening? Looking at it?&quot;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;exhibit-b-logs&quot;&gt;Exhibit B: Logs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any self respecting company running software on distributed machines should have centralized, searchable logs for their services. The memories of ssh-ing into multiple hosts in multiple terminal tabs, then firing a request to see which machine got the request still haunt me. Then to get past this, someone created a wrapper (called &lt;code&gt;remote-command&lt;/code&gt;) which'd run a command on multiple hosts, so you could grep on multiple hosts, but I have to admit that I could never get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company makes CloudWatch. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;exhibit-c-service-discovery&quot;&gt;Exhibit C: Service Discovery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What service discovery? We used to hard wire load balancer host names in config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;One time we had to do JDK8 migration on a service, that just kept bouncing from one team to other. Because the reorgs were the only ways manager could improve the efficiency of teams. Nobody chants &lt;strong&gt;Ownership&lt;/strong&gt; more than Amazon managers. But ownership in Amazon is a one way street, which is you saying &quot;Yes&quot; to whatever you are given. The number of re-orgs and services bouncing from one team to other is the very opposite of Ownership.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Anyway, so we had to migrate this service, and someone asked &quot;Well, who's using it?&quot;. And nobody had answer to that question. This company is doing SOA for last 10 years and nobody knew how to figure out a definitive way to find which service was talking to which. This company had posters of &quot;Ownership&quot;, where nobody in the team owning the service knew who was using it.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;So how did we do it? We just decided to shut down the service and see if anyone complained. No one did, and the service stayed shut.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;exhibit-d-containers&quot;&gt;Exhibit D: Containers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While containers were taking all over the world in last 4 years, they were unheard of inside Amazon. I am sure, in some design meeting, some junior engineer mentioned containers and was shut down because the L7 manager couldn't care less. He had deliverables to take care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of productive man hours lost struggling with Amazon's internal systems used to be insane, yet everybody used to take it as a way of life. The aim is to make the tools easier to use, not to get used to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazon-does-not-experiment&quot;&gt;Amazon does not experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not saying, a company has to jump to shiny new thing, but as a tech leader, you should be experimenting and paving the way forward. And that's a general problem with Amazon. They. Don't. Experiment. (unless it brings them money, in which case, sure Alexa)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many open source tools and libraries have come out of Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook contributed React; Google gave us TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and lot more. Microsoft, which according to Bezos is on it's Day 2 is largest OSS contributor on Github. Twitter, LinkedIn Square, AirBnb - I could go on. But Amazon doesn't give a fuck. Because giving back to community takes time, but nobody inside has time to look beyond next deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon will be the first one to take an open source tool like Presto, and sell it as a hosted service, but they won't come up with Presto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But OSS contributions isn't the only area where Amazon lags behind. Facebook thought PHP wasn't good enough, so they developed Hack. Google is a big Java/C++ shop, but they developed Go to better serve their developers. A small startup like Jetbrains developed Kotlin because they wanted a modern language for JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Amazon, which has thousands of services written in Java never felt the need for a better language? I find it hard to believe do. And I am not talking about inventing a new language, not every company has to do that. The problem is that internally, at Amazon, you can't even use a language other than Java. They have some amount of Rails, and JavaScript has to be there, but if you want to experiment with, say, Go, Kotlin, or anything else, you are going to get nothing but push back. I thought one of the advantages of SOA was that teams could chose their stack, but that's something you don't see at Amazon. (As far as I know, Node.js was used inside in a limited capacity, but they had an alternative for &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; for security reasons, and you had to get an npm package approved to use it internally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Facebook for example, 50 percent of messenger.com code is written in ReasonML, which is definitely not a mainstream language. And that's a product used by a billion users. That requires treading on uncomfortable technical grounds, something an Amazon team will never do. (again, unless the &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt;, unless it's critical to their revenues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a thin line between standardization and discouraging experimentation and Amazon falls way on the wrong side of that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1. During my time there, there was an internal movement called MAWS - Move to AWS - going on, which aimed to migrate all teams to AWS. Not sure if that ever materialized.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FTC Seeks to Examine the Privacy Practices of U.S. Broadband Providers</title>
<link>https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/03/ftc-seeks-examine-privacy-practices-broadband-providers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/03/ftc-seeks-examine-privacy-practices-broadband-providers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-seeks-examine-privacy-practices-broadband-providers/isp_privacy_model_order.pdf&quot;&gt;orders to seven U.S. Internet broadband providers and related entities&lt;/a&gt; seeking information the agency will use to examine how broadband companies collect, retain, use, and disclose information about consumers and their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orders&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;seek information about the companies’ privacy policies, procedures, and practices. The orders were sent to: AT&amp;amp;T Inc., AT&amp;amp;T Mobility LLC, Comcast Cable Communications doing business as Xfinity, Google Fiber Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., and Cellco Partnership doing business as Verizon Wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is initiating this study to better understand Internet service providers’ privacy practices in light of the evolution of telecommunications companies into vertically integrated platforms that also provide advertising-supported content. Under current law, the FTC has the ability to enforce against unfair and deceptive practices involving Internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is seeking information from the seven companies that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The categories of personal information collected about consumers or their devices, including the purpose for which the information is collected or used; the techniques for collecting such information; whether the information collected is shared with third parties; internal policies for access to such data; and how long the information is retained;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the information is aggregated, anonymized or deidentified;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copies of the companies’ notices and disclosures to consumers about their data collection practices;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the companies offer consumers choices about the collection, retention, use and disclosure of personal information, and whether the companies have denied or degraded service to consumers who decline to opt-in to data collection; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedures and processes for allowing consumers to access, correct, or delete their personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission is authorized to issue the Orders to File a Special Report by Section 6(b) of the FTC Act. The Commission vote to issue the orders was 5-0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission works to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-competition&quot;&gt;promote competition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection&quot;&gt;protect and educate consumers&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/&quot;&gt;learn more about consumer topics&lt;/a&gt; and file a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/complaint&quot;&gt;consumer complaint online&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357). Like the FTC on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/federaltradecommission&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FTC&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/stay-connected&quot;&gt;subscribe to press releases&lt;/a&gt; for the latest FTC news and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google launches AMP for email</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/google-makes-emails-more-dynamic-with-amp-for-email/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/google-makes-emails-more-dynamic-with-amp-for-email/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; today officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/amp-for-email-developer-preview&quot;&gt;AMP for Email&lt;/a&gt;, its effort to turn emails from static documents into dynamic, web page-like experiences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.amp.dev/2019/03/26/building-the-future-of-email-with-amp/&quot;&gt;AMP for Email&lt;/a&gt; is coming to Gmail, but other major email providers like Yahoo Mail (which shares its parent company with TechCrunch), Outlook and Mail.ru will also support AMP emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been more than a year since Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/bringing-power-amp-gmail/&quot;&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; this initiative. Even by Google standards, that’s a long incubation phase, though there’s also plenty of back-end work necessary to make this feature work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of AMP for Email is that it’ll turn basic messages into a surface for actually getting things done. “Over the past decade, our web experiences have changed enormously—evolving from static flat content to interactive apps—yet email has largely stayed the same with static messages that eventually go out of date or are merely a springboard to accomplishing a more complex task,” Gmail product manager Aakash Sahney writes. “If you want to take action, you usually have to click on a link, open a new tab, and visit another website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1801999&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dynamic-Mail_Oyo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AMP for Email, those messages become interactive. That means you’ll be able to RSVP to an event right from the message, fill out a questionnaire, browse through a store’s inventory or respond to a comment — all without leaving your web-based email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies that already support this new format are &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/booking-com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;booking-com&quot;&gt;Booking.com,&lt;/a&gt; Despegar, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/doodle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;doodle&quot;&gt;Doodle,&lt;/a&gt; Ecwid, Freshworks, Nexxt, OYO Rooms, Pinterest and redBus. If you regularly get emails from these companies, then chances are you’ll receive an interactive email from them in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers, supporting this format should be fairly easy, especially if they have prior experience with building AMP pages. The format supports many popular AMP markup features, including carousels, forms and lists. It’s also worth noting that these messages &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/docs/interaction_dynamic/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format&quot;&gt;still include standard HTML&lt;/a&gt; markup as a fallback for email clients that support AMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its first announcement, Google has also brought on a number of partners that will support AMP for Email on their platforms. These include email delivery and analytics platform SparkPost, the email design and marketing tool Litmus, Twilio Sendgrid and Amazon’s SES and Pinpoint email and marketing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No everybody is going to like this (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/&quot;&gt;our own Devin Coldewey&lt;/a&gt;). AMP itself, after all, remains somewhat controversial given that it creates a new markup and infrastructure that wouldn’t be necessary if people created faster and simpler web sites to begin with. Bringing it to email, which for all its shortcomings remains one of the few formats that reliably work across all vendors and clients, won’t be everybody’s cup of tea either. Marketers, however, are bound to love it and I doubt most users are going to care about the politics here if it allows them to get their work done faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1801993&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dynamic-Mail_Docs.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Working for a startup makes less sense, unless you are into the mission</title>
<link>https://jatins.gitlab.io/me/why-startup/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jatins.gitlab.io/me/why-startup/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Paul Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started in the industry working at Amazon. But I was always enamored of startups. PG was one true god and working at startups seemed to be the only way to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get Rich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do meaningful work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s all I want from my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I left Amazon when my bullsh't threshold was reached after n’th re-org, worked with a friend on our own project for a while, took it to an alpha/proto stage, tried raising some money to support the development efforts. That hardly ever works out when you are trying to reinvent databases, without someone important vouching for you, or without enough traction. We had none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t done with startups, they still seemed like the holy grail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up joining a cloud security startup. Joined as an early engineer (employee #15, and probably around 10th engineer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s pause here and look at the promises of a startup as an early employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast career growth. It’s a small company, so you can grow easily if you work hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rich quick in case of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More learning. Small company, so you get to work on a variety of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That startup sold for 200 million dollars and, as the 10th engineer, I made ... 15000 dollars from that exit. Let me put that figure in perspective. That is the same amount a recent college grad would make at Facebook in 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get rich quick scenario definitely didn’t turn to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, what about career growth and learning?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, it’s harder to have any visible growth in a startup because well first, what do you grow to? There is no clear hierarchy, no promotion paths. The “no titles” thing is great in theory but unless you have a naturally dominating personality, it likely won't work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;But I am sure, you learned a lot?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned. But was it disproportionate to what I’d have learned in a BigCo. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing startups prioritize is Shipping (probably the only word more abused that &lt;em&gt;ownership&lt;/em&gt; in tech). Which is correct, that is what's keeping them alive. But you can’t have moonshot technical projects when you have only 6 months of money in the bank. Shipping is great, only when it’s not. In my experience, the deadline-driven culture crushes any scope for creativity and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's another major problem: Founder's goals and your goals, as an engineer, will not be aligned most of the times. The founders, in your average startup, are thinking on a time frame of next 2 years &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt;. And a lot of times, they are figuring it out themselves. Which is fair, but where do you think an employee's, &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; career growth will fit into that plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incentives are just not aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual conversations (not verbatim, of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, I think we should experiment with Kotlin. It has lots of traction, Google officially supports it on Android and seems might help us write better code. Here is a PR showing how it’ll fit into our project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Umm, engineers will need to learn a new language. We have other priorities right now. Let’s consider it later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This needs a queue. This is literally is why queues exist”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, we don’t have queues anywhere else. We don’t want to complicate things right now. Can we just use a Postgres table?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;The second one is not necessarily a bad solution, just illustrates the point that in the absence of BigCo scale, you, as an engineer, might not get a chance to architect systems you might get at a bigger company &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;I am still not done with startups, though. I am onto my next one with the hopes of this being the startup dream turned to reality.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;It hasn’t been. Yet.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-that-mean-you-shouldn-t-work-at-startups-&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Does that mean you shouldn’t work at startups?&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;No, but it makes increasingly less sense.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;I’d have loved to be an early or even late engineer at AirBnbs or Stripes of the world. But I think these are a small subset of startups and a lot of things have to align for your startup experience, as an engineer, to be worthwhile:&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Hopefully, it’s a consumer startup because enterprise startups run on sales and not on engineering. Which creates an extremely short term, feature, and deadline driven culture.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;The startup goes big ala Airbnb, or Uber and you hopefully get the work at scale because most application development is commoditized otherwise.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;You actually have enough equity to get worthwhile value out of your work.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Or you just really care about the company mission.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;You should at least have one or two of these things. Enterprise companies, for example, don’t generally see the scale, or engineering challenges of consumer companies, so you better have enough equity for it to be worth for you. (Note that enterprise companies make great business sense if you are a founder. But if you are, say, the 35th engineer at one such company, you might get the worst of many worlds and best of none.)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;And if you don’t have #4, you should at least have #3.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Okay, so most startups are not great. You already knew that because most of them fail and failure isn’t great. However, to me, it’s dubious how many startup successes, especially in India, have been great for, say, 20th to 50th engineer at those companies. Swiggys, Olas and Paytms of the country are infamous for not giving good (or any, these days) equity to engineers.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-big-companies-&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;What About The Big Companies?&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;BigCos have their own issues. Sheer politics will drive a lot of people crazy but there are areas where they do better:&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Better scale and engineering challenges of problems&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;More scope for moonshots, and if you can switch teams you can end up in one of them&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Better comp (and unlike startups, it’s not in a rosy future)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Better Work-Life Balance. I have heard generally good things about the overall culture at Google and Facebook. Everyone I know at Microsoft/LinkedIn works practically 4 days a week. Amazon is a different story, though.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;At the end of the day, what I am getting at is that with BigCos you know what you are getting into but with startups, only the best case scenario seems worth it. And the best case scenario requires literal aligning of stars.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Keep in mind that we aren't even talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/15/clunk/&quot;&gt;worst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2019/1/17/18187148/snap-executive-team-turnover-departures-evan-spiegel-stock&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-scammed-by-a-silicon-valley-startup-574ced8acdff&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; world yet. We are not talking about how a lot of startups are just &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourstory.com/2018/10/chamath-palihapitiya-startups-ponzi-scheme&quot;&gt;Ponzi schemes&lt;/a&gt;, existing to be sold.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;You can literally get screwed in more ways than you can count. I have a friend who worked at a startup whose founders were plain abusive and should be in jail for frauds. I have a friend who worked at a startup whose founders are under investigation for hundreds of millions of crypto fraud. I was personally been shouted upon so badly by a founder at a company I interned at that I could have started crying if the other founder had not helped; to nobody's surprise they didn't pay the promised salaries.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why I think that unless you really care about the mission of a company, working at startups makes increasingly less sense. The odds are just not in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google will open a new office complex and add hundreds of jobs in Taiwan</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/google-will-open-a-new-office-complex-and-add-hundreds-of-jobs-in-taiwan/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced today it will expand its office space in Taiwan with a new complex in Banqiao District, New Taipei City. The space will be in Taipei Far Eastern Telecom Park, about a 20-minute drive away from its offices in Taipei 101. Google currently has 2,000 employees in the country and plans to hire several hundred more, with an emphasis on hiring more women, said Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, during a press conference today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex will also play an important role in Google’s Intelligent Taiwan project, which it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/intelligent-taiwan/&quot;&gt;announced in May 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the project trained about 5,000 students in AI technology and 50,000 digital marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/project-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;Project Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s controversial project to build a censored version of its search engine for China, close attention will be paid to what the company does in Taiwan and its other hubs in Asia. Google reportedly halted Dragonfly last year, before employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/03/04/google-ongoing-project-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;told The Intercept&lt;/a&gt; that they had seen evidence of continued work on the project. A Google spokesperson said there was no link between those issues and the expansion of its Taiwan offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/google-htc/&quot;&gt;completed its $1.1 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of a large part of HTC’s smartphone unit at the beginning of 2018, Taiwan became its biggest Asian engineering hub. Google pulled out of China in 2010, citing censorship issues, and the revelation of Project Dragonfly, an apparent reversal on its earlier stance, was met with controversy internally by Google employees. The company’s potential re-launch in China was also one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/google-ceo-wont-rule-out-relaunching-in-china/&quot;&gt;main topics of questioning&lt;/a&gt; during CEO Sundar Pichai’s House Judiciary committee hearing in December.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Add detailed message to NullPointerException describing what is null</title>
<link>https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8220715</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8220715</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;Summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NullPointerExceptions are freqently encountered developing or maintaining a Java application. NullPointerExceptions often don't contain a message. This complicates finding the cause of the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This JEP proposes to enhance the exception text to tell what was null and which action failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, a common NullPointerException does not contain a helpful message. The following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;a.to_b.to_c = null;
a.to_b.to_c.to_d.num = 99;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will just print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;java.lang.NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not help to find out what was null. Was it &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;code&gt;a.to_b&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;code&gt;a.to_b.to_c&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'a.to_b.to_c' is null. Can not read field 'to_d'.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will immediately tell where the exception was thrown. For more message examples see [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same algorithm can be used to improve other messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;a[i][j][k]; // Index j is out-of-bounds&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;currently prints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 99 out of bounds for length 2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message does not tell which index is out of bounds. This can be improved to print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: a[i][j]: Index j = 99 out of bounds for length 2&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Basic-algorithm-to-compute-the-message&quot;&gt;Basic algorithm to compute the message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java code like &lt;code&gt;a.to_b.to_c&lt;/code&gt; is compiled to several bytecode instructions. When the exception is raised, the original Java code is not available, but the bytecodes. Given the bytecodes of the method in which the exception was raised and the precise bytecode where it happened, information about the exeption context can be derived and printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an exception is raised, the precise position in the bytecode, i.e. the instruction that caused the exception, is known by the virtual machine. This is stored in the 'backtrace' datastructure of a Throwable object which is held in a field private to the jvm implementation. It also contains a reference to the method that was executed [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assemble a string as &lt;code&gt;a.to_b.to_c&lt;/code&gt; the bytecodes must be visited in reverse execution order starting at the bytecode that raised the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a bytecode, one knows which expression stack slots it pops, i.e., it is known which slot contains the null value. If one knows which bytecode pushed the null value, one can print the message. Going several steps backwards allows more comprehensive strings as, e.g., &lt;code&gt;a.to_b.to_c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the bytecode, it is not obvious which previous instruction pushed the null value. To find out about this, a simple data flow analysis is run on the bytecodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data flow analysis walks the bytecodes forward simulating the execution stack. The simulated stack does not contain the values computed by the bytecodes, but information about which bytecode pushed the value to the stack. Therefore this analysis terminates quickly. The analysis runs until the information for the bytecode that raised the exception is available. Thus, it stops before analysing the whole method [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this information, the message can be assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message consists of two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the bytecode that failed to execute the intended action can be described. Knowing the semantics of bytecodes, a message for each can be formulated [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the bytecodes that pushed the null value onto the stack, a message telling which entity is null can be assembled. This is the essential part of the message [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing the second part of these messages can fail due to insufficient information (e.g. for expression (a ? b : c).d it can not be computed where the null reference came from). In this case the message part is omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Different-bytecode-variants-of-a-method&quot;&gt;Different bytecode variants of a method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to redefinition and bytecode modification different variants of the same method can be used by the jvm implementation. The bytecode used can differ from the bytecodes in the original class file that was loaded. The analysis must operate on the very bytecode that has been executed when the exception was raised. The bytecode index stored in the exception must point to the instruction that caused the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the method attached to the backtrace, this is guaranteed by construction. The method representation referenced from the backtrace is always the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Computation-overhead&quot;&gt;Computation overhead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NullPointerExceptions are thrown frequently. Each time a NullPointerException object is created. Usually, exception messages are computed at Object creation time and stored in the private field 'detailMessage' of Throwable. As computing the NullPointerException message proposed here is a considerable overhead, this would slow down throwing NullPointerExceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most Exceptions are discarded without looking at the message. I.e, if we delay computing the message until it is actually accessed, we omit the effort for all the exceptions that are discarded without printing the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Throwable gives access to the stackTrace, a representation of the stack trace when the exception was thrown. This consists of a lot of Java Objects. Here too, it would be costly to build this information at object construction time. Therefore the information is stored in an intermediate format in the internal 'backtrace' field. Only if the stackTrace is accessed from Java, the actual Java objects are created. This is the same approach as this JEP proposes for the NullPointerException message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the message is printed based on the backtrace, it must be omitted if the top frame was dropped from the backtrace. This happens for generated methods that are marked as hidden. This fact must be preserved until the message is printed.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Message-persistance&quot;&gt;Message persistance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, an exception message is passed to the constructor of Throwable that writes it to its private field 'detailMessage'. If we compute the message only on access, we can no more pass it to the Throwable constuctor. As the field is private, there is no natural way to store the message in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several possibilities to overcome this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;make detailMessage package-private.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use a shared secret to write it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write to the detailMessage field via JNI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to recomputed the message each time it is accessed. Presumably, the common use case is to get it once to write it to some output, so the additional overhead of recomputing the message should be encountered rarely. Following this approach, &lt;code&gt;npe.getMessage() == npe.getMessage()&lt;/code&gt; will not hold, as it is the case for other exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'backtrace' field can be cleared after the stackTrace has been computed. E.g., if a Throwable is serialized, the backtrace is gone. If the backtrace is lost, the message can no more be computed. It must either be computed and stored to some field, or the bytecode index and method must be preserved. If this is not done, &lt;code&gt;npe.getMessage()&lt;/code&gt; will first deliver a useful message, and on later calls it will return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; for the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For serialization, this can be solved implementing writeReplace().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Message-content&quot;&gt;Message content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed generated message should only be printed if the NullPointerException is raised by the runtime. If the exception is explicitly constructed, it makes no sense to add the message. It will be misleading, as no real NullPointerException was encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message can not regain the original code 1:1. The message should try though to give as much resemblance to code as possible. This makes it easy to understand and compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message will mention information from the code like class names, method names, field names and variable names. It must be decided whether these need to be quoted or not. Other exception messages, as IllegalAccessError, don't quote class names etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method signatures should be printed in Java syntax. Currently, they are printed in the compressed format. I propose to change this in a follow up, as many other exceptions use the compressed format in their messages. Again, see IllegalAccessError.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local variable names are retrieved from the debug information. If a class file does not contain this information, a replacement must be found. A first proposal is to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;local1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;local2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;parameter1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Alternatives&quot;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current proposal is to implement this in the Java runtime in C++ accessing directly the available datastructures in the metaspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, this can be implemented in Java. Basic functionality is available in the class library, e.g. StackWalker to retrieve the bytecode index and ASM to analyze bytecodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds further overhead though, as datastructures must be replicated in Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, ASM and StackWalker do not support the full functionality needed. StackWalker must be called in the NullPointerException constructor. For performance reasons, this is not desirable, see above. StackWalker could be changed to operate on the backtrace information captured in the Throwable, all needed information should be available. This requires changes to StackWalker, Throwable and implementation of C++ code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASM does not have a notion of bytecode indexes. I.e., given a bytecode index, you can not access the corresponding bytecode. It is straight forward to extend ASM to compute this information when parsing the bytecodes. Complex bytecodes as tableswitch must be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASM should operate on the actual bytecode used. A file&lt;br /&gt;containing the class might not be available or hard to locate. The bytecode run by the virtual machine may be modified in many ways. It might be possible to use the information returned by JvmtiClassFileReconstitutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test checking for regressions of the messages will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic implementation is in use in SAP's internal Java virtual machine since 2006. We run all jtreg tests, many jck tests and various other tests on the current implementation. No issues were encountered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Risks-and-Assumptions&quot;&gt;Risks and Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imposes overhead on retrieving the message of a NullPointerMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of breaking something in the virtual machine is low. The feature can be implemented completely on top of existing data structures without changeing them. Only writing the 'detailMessage' field of Throwable late is a considerable change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation needs to be extended if new bytecodes are added to the Bytecode specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was raised that printing field names or local names might impose a security problem. If so, this should be addressed more globaly. Other exceptions already print field information (IllegalAccessError). Class and method names are contained in the stack trace. Printing field names in NullPointerExceptions should not impose any new security problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Dependencies&quot;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None. A stable and tested prototype exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;References&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prototype has been proposed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8218628&quot;&gt;8218628: Add detailed message to NullPointerException describing what is null.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~goetz/wr19/8218628-exMsg-NPE/&quot;&gt;webrev&lt;/a&gt; of the prototype is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~goetz/wr19/8218628-exMsg-NPE/05-otherMessages/output_with_debug_info.txt&quot;&gt;Messages if classfiles contain debug info.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~goetz/wr19/8218628-exMsg-NPE/05-otherMessages/output_no_debug_info.txt&quot;&gt;Messages if classfiles contain no debug info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;code&gt;java_lang_Throwable::get_method_and_bci(...)&lt;/code&gt; retrieves the needed information of the top frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the following references see prims.cpp: JVM_GetExtendedNPEMessage(...) in the webrev:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] The data flow analysis of the bytecodes is implemented in the &lt;code&gt;TrackingStackCreator&lt;/code&gt; constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] The message part for the failed action is computed by &lt;code&gt;TrackingStackCreator.get_null_pointer_slot(...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] The message part describing the null entity is computed by &lt;code&gt;TrackingStackCreator.get_source(...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] A solution is proposed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8221077&quot;&gt;8221077&lt;/a&gt;: No NullPointerException message if top frame is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I Learned in My First Year Year as a Solo Founder</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tik.dev/lessons-learned</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://tik.dev/static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/7273b/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Jad Limcaco on Unsplash&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://tik.dev/static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/d564d/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/865fd/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 240w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/d40a0/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 480w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/d564d/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 960w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/c67c1/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 1440w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/667be/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 1920w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/85f07/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 2880w, /static/d9c4589d8c3c60bdccdaef4abfe6237f/7273b/jad-limcaco-272413-unsplash.jpg 4896w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I decided to start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;side-project&lt;/a&gt; so I could have a second source of income. I thought that building a side-business would help me gain skills that I’d not otherwise acquire in my current job. It would be a year full of joy and disappointment, but little did I know that it would also turn out to be the best year for my personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into writing, found my true professional passion, generated around $4000 net revenue, and met great people who inspired and helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/index/&quot;&gt;a couple of articles about my side-business&lt;/a&gt; in the past, I decided to switch the focus of this story and talk about the biggest lessons I’ve learned while building Cronhub. These lessons helped me to develop valuable mental models that I still use to make better decisions for my product. I think some of these lessons might be confronting for you, so please take these with a grain of salt as they’re based solely on my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why to have a side-project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a full-time job, the chances are low that the work you do daily is portable. Having a side-project is a great opportunity for you to expose yourself to and build an audience. One reason some people prefer to work on Open Source Software (OSS) is because it’s a transferable asset—when you change jobs, you don’t lose what you have produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a side-project is a great way to learn new skills, and to showcase and sell your skills to future clients and employers. If you can code, then building a side-project is a great way to make something from scratch and get experience with technical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why to have a side-business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re based in America (or even somewhere else), you probably already know that most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. I’m not judging anyone who chooses to live this lifestyle. However, I want assets that earn money while I sleep and not rent my time my whole life. If you’re like me, you value financial and personal freedom and seek ways to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen a path that is less risky. I started a business on the side without quitting my full-time job. It’s possible that when my own business provides enough income, I will work on it full-time. Also, building something valuable that other people are willing to pay is a great feeling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be your own user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you lack ideas, solving your own problem can be a good way to build something other people want. If you have the X problem, it’s very likely other people have the same problem. When you’re your own user, you have a huge advantage: many things suddenly become much easier, such as what to build next or how to understand your product market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launching your business is just one milestone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many times I’ve seen people start something but never finish it. That’s why I praise people who actually launch something. When you start a project, you always think that finishing and launching your project is the hardest part. However, after the launch you realize that the most difficult part is just ahead. It’s where the actual work comes in. “If you build it, they will come” is a myth. You have to acquire your users, however you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not having a co-founder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a solo founder is hard, but it has a silver lining. The communication cost of making decisions and shipping something is extremely low. Do not let people tell you that you need a co-founder to build a successful business. I have many examples of solo founders building million-dollar companies. Of course, having a co-worker might make things much easier, but finding someone who is natural fit as your business partner is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raising money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand people who start a business to become their own boss but end up raising a ton of money from investors. You report to investors and they impact your decisions and, consequently, the direction of the company. It’s not a binary choice, and you can still build a successful business without raising a penny. Whether you need to raise money depends on your ultimate goal. If you want to build a hyper-growth company with hundreds of millions of revenue, then raising money might be a better choice. However, if you prefer to have a small team with full autonomy, then focus on making your business profitable and not on raising money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a sustainable distribution channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a solo founder, I strongly suggest you invest heavily in building a sustainable distribution channel for your product. It could be optimizing for SEO or launching your product apps in different marketplaces. In the long run, building constant exposure for your product will help you to focus more on building and less on marketing it. This is important especially for single founders for whom finding enough time is always the biggest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treat pricing as any other feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not invest too much time early on designing the perfect pricing model for your product. As with any feature on your product, it’s okay to iterate on your pricing table and change it over time. Support yearly plans because you will be surprised how many customers prefer the yearly plan if it includes a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about your business and sharing your learnings with your audience is worth your time. Writing helps you to promote your work and expand your network. Regardless of whether your business succeeds or fails, you won’t lose your audience and it’s a great foundation for your next thing. Writing is also a great exercise for self-discovery. When you write, you become more self-aware and start to better understand your strengths and weaknesses. When you’re more self-aware, you become better at delegating your tasks and it helps your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sell your story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often I see people using X products because of their stories. Some of my customers are my loyal readers who want to support me and my project. In fact, writing this article is one way of selling my story. Being good at sales is invaluable. Many developers are intimidated by sales, especially introverts. However, if you read To Sell is Human, you learn that you don’t have to be an extrovert to be good at sales. There are many ways to get into sales, and it doesn’t have to be cold calling or emailing. Writing, storytelling, or speaking at conferences are great ways to sell your personal brand and your products. Maybe start from there to build leverage and become better at sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s okay to feel down sometimes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be days, even weeks, when you’re unproductive and don’t make any progress. It’s always been a riddle for me, and I don’t think there is a magic formula for getting out of it. Sadly, the only solution I’ve found so far is to wait for the fog to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally ask yourself whether you’re working on the most important task. Often we deviate from the right path and asking this question helps you to remedy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define and measure your product metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s vital, especially early on, to define the success metrics for your business. When you define and measure them, you can easily track your progress and build trust on your decisions. If your goal is to increase the conversion rate, then build tunnels and see which one sticks more. Running experiments early on should be part of any business. There is always uncertainty, and coming up with solutions is what makes the challenge of building your business so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t reprioritize your tasks too often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I have made this mistake many times, but I have learned my lesson. Don’t change your product roadmap based on a single user feedback. Try to notice patterns. Only when you’re sure that it’s the right thing to work on, start building. It’s important to find the balance between the features you think you should be working on and what your users think you should be working on. Over time, most founders develop improved intuition and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask for what you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of asking for what you want. Seek help, and don’t be shy. If you need advice, ask. Most people are generous and love helping others. I use email and Twitter to connect with people I admire and follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading and watching stories of other makers is only for inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading stories like this one or stories about other makers building profitable products will inspire you. You’re the one who should make the steps. Believe in yourself, but, most importantly, believe in your work. Self-belief is the key to success in anything you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

                    Studies suggest that biorhythms are disrupted by changing the clocks
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The European Parliament has backed a proposal to stop the obligatory one-hour clock change which extends daylight hours in summer EU-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/630308/EPRS_BRI(2018)630308_EN.pdf&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;The proposal requires states to stop the twice-yearly clock change&lt;/a&gt; from 2021, and choose either permanent summer time or winter time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers will also have a say on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under an EU directive, all 28 states currently switch to summer time on the last Sunday of March and back to winter time on the last Sunday of October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission - in charge of drafting EU legislation - made the proposal last year, after a public consultation which showed 84% of respondents wanting to scrap the biannual clock changes. There were 4.6 million replies in that consultation, 70% of which were from Germans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MEPs and the Commission stress that states must co-ordinate their choices, to minimise the risk of economic disruption from a patchwork of different time systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What are the pros and cons of summer time?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daylight saving time (DST) - so-called summer time - has been compulsory in the EU since 2001, aimed at making the EU internal market work more smoothly and reducing energy costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer time differences, it was argued, would facilitate cross-border trade and travel in the EU. The extra daylight hours in summer could reduce spending on artificial lighting and help outdoor leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the energy savings from DST have proven to be quite marginal. And some of the EU's major trading partners - among them China, Russia and Turkey - do not operate under DST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation and scientific studies suggested that the clock changes were having negative effects on people's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Commission says studies suggest &quot;the effect on the human biorhythm may be more severe than previously thought&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said &quot;there is no applause when EU law dictates that Europeans have to change the clocks twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Clock-changing must stop. Member states should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or winter time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new legislation, governments opting to make summer time permanent would adjust their clocks for the last time on the last Sunday in March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those choosing permanent standard time - also called winter time - the final clock change would be on the last Sunday of October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Read more on the world's time controversies:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland called for daylight saving to be abolished EU-wide, after a petition gathered more than 70,000 signatures from citizens calling for such a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition to the clock changes tends to be greater in northern countries, where seasonal differences in daylight hours are greater than in the south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Finland has 18.5 hours of daylight, but in December only 5.5 hours. The corresponding figures for Greece are 14.5 hours and 9.3 hours. Yet both countries are in the same standard time zone - Eastern European Time (GMT+2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What are the EU's time zones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the winter, spring and autumn, when DST is not applied, there are three standard time zones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Three states apply GMT (the UK, Ireland and Portugal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;17 have Central European Time, which is GMT+1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Eight have Eastern European Time, which is GMT+2.&lt;/li&gt;
