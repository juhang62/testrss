<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/david-mayman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;david-mayman&quot;&gt;David Mayman&lt;/a&gt; has a vision for personal aviation that he’s spent the past dozen years and millions of his personal fortune chasing. He hasn’t accepted the convention that jetpacks were just a misguided fantasy for the future; his company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetpackaviation.com/&quot;&gt;Jetpack Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, has been building them and he’s been zooming around in publicity-grabbing stunts in a plea to the public that there’s room to dream when it comes to human flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while an eight-person startup aiming to build out a fleet of $380,000 “flying motorcycles” might seem like a tall order, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;y-combinator&quot;&gt;Y Combinator,&lt;/a&gt; a top accelerator known for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/nectome/&quot;&gt;occasionally bizarre bets&lt;/a&gt;, is gambling on the company and its jet engine-obsessed CEO in one of its latest investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FneaFcVZyos?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/jetpack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;jetpack&quot;&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; Aviation is about to become a very different company. The startup has launched pre-orders this week for the moonshot of moonshots, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jetpackaviation.com/recreational-speeder/&quot;&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt;, a personal vertical take-off and landing vehicle with a svelte concept design that looks straight out of Star Wars or Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-pocketed, sci-fi-minded buyers are going to have to fork over $10,000 just to get a spot in the pre-order line for the first vehicles to ship, but the startup’s founder seems to see the campaign as less about the money than it is about the confirmation that there are people interested in planting a stake in his wild company’s future success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a validation statement for all of us,” Mayman tells TechCrunch. “If you look at how long Tesla took to deliver the Model 3 to customers, I think people understand that this is not something that’s a Kickstarted pre-delivery campaign where at the tail-end of it we’re immediately going to be delivering product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are gambles and then there are flying motorcycles. This is frankly an atypical startup for YC to fund, but it is also an unconventional business path for Mayman, who has largely been self-financing his jetpack-building obsession for the past 12 years. &lt;span&gt;For the Australian CEO, the YC investment is mainly about gaining access to Silicon Valley’s network of VCs, though he also acknowledges it’s a fair assumption that SF breeds the type of executive that might be interested in pre-ordering something so seemingly outlandish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t imagine someone not being excited about a flying motorcycle,” YC partner Jared Friedman told TechCrunch in an email. “Jetpack Aviation created the future with Speeder, and I look forward to seeing how this technology transforms the dreaded commute, vacation travel, and everyday errands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the excitement Mayman has raised for his company’s jetpacks has relied on the spectacle of prototype demos in front of throngs of news networks (Jetpack Aviation has unsurprisingly partnered with Red Bull), the company has yet to build a full-scale prototype of the Speeder, though he says their new round of funding should get them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1793808&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1793808&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-1793808&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?w=627&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;526&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?resize=138,150 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?resize=277,300 277w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?resize=768,833 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?resize=627,680 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-06-at-6.16.08-PM.png?resize=46,50 46w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1793808&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Mayman flying a jetpack around the Statue of Liberty in 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they actually build this? That’s seems to be a pretty valid question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, Mayman acknowledges upfront that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Speeder is “at least” two years of development time away from ending up in customer hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company will have to raise “tens of millions” of dollars to ship this design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are still plenty of unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jetpack Aviation’s current design is more ambitious than most helicopter-shaped concept VTOL vehicles being pursued by companies like Uber, namely due to its relatively sleek design where the human rider is directly above a set of several gimbal-mounted jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company claims finished designs will move faster than 150 mph at altitudes up to 15,000 feet. The flight time is still a limiting factor; max flight times for the models are estimated to be around 30 minutes. The company is planning a number of versions, including an ultralight model that complies with some federal regulations and won’t require a pilot’s license, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup’s most pertinent problem is creating the autonomous stabilization technologies that will make flying the Speeder effortless and safe. Mayman notes that most VTOL designs look like quadcopters simply because the physics of putting weight directly on top of the thrust system is so challenging. “It’s like trying to balance a pencil on your finger,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His team has been training people to use their jetpacks — now in their 11th design iteration — and say it takes about a week to get potential flyers up-and-running with the particulars of the system. But Mayman says he wants this to be a device that just works, a design concept that made a lot of sense when Steve Jobs was using it to refer to the simplicity of the iPad, but feels a tad more aggressive when presented with the rendered images of someone flying this thing over city centers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/URgznwTph6M?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the industry’s existing work around autonomous flight and stabilization for drone aircraft really doesn’t account for Jetpack Aviation’s design, though Mayman says they’ve already made some significant progress with their 1:3 scale prototype. He also notes that the company does have a “less elegant-looking” plan-B design if they determine the centrally clustered jet engines are too much of a stabilization liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the key for getting a concept like this off the ground and ensuring the company doesn’t miserably fail is being flexible about how this vision matures, Mayman says, noting that they’re approaching the vehicle with multiple designs and multiple considerations for how the regulatory environment for certification shapes up, including work on a separate military version and consideration for designs more focused on emergency response like rapid medical evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether pre-orderers plunking down $10K might be disappointed by a different-looking product, the founder said that they’ve done enough modeling to know that what they build will fall into a roughly similar design. “It may not look exactly like what we’ve rendered, but I’m confident that it’s still going to be the same sort of concept, a motorcycle or jet-ski size and shape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly a unique choice for the company to launch its pre-orders already with so much in the air, but it’s fairly apparent that they are looking to emulate Tesla here, and if people with nearly $400K to throw around want to buy a jet-engine jet-ski, then by all means, let the free market do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator’s $150,000 investment is an early step for the moonshot effort and a vote of confidence that places them on others’ radar. Mayman, for his part, does seem genuinely thrilled about expanding the ambitions of his passion project, even if the road ahead is crowded with obstacles for realizing the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t start it, you’re never going to get there,” Mayman says. “If our guys weren’t able to wake up every morning saying, ‘Holy shit, this would be freaking amazing if we can build this,’ then it’s sort of not worth doing. We might as well go do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot; data-initials=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On February 25th, 2019, I discovered a non-password protected 150GB-sized MongoDB instance. This is perhaps the biggest and most comprehensive email database I have ever reported. Upon verification I was shocked at the massive number of emails that were publicly accessible for anyone with an internet connection. Some of data was much more detailed than just the email address and included personally identifiable information (PII).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This database contained four separate collections of data and combined was an astounding 808,539,939 records. The largest part of it was named ‘mailEmailDatabase’ – and inside it contained three folders:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emailrecords (count: 798,171,891 records)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;emailWithPhone (count: 4,150,600 records)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;businessLeads (count: 6,217,358 records)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-350&quot; src=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;511&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; srcset=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic3.jpg 692w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic3-300x241.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Emailrecords’ was structured  to include zip / phone / address / gender / email / user IP / DOB:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-348&quot; src=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic1.jpg 825w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic1-300x119.jpg 300w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic1-768x305.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of the verification process I  cross-checked a random selection of records with Troy Hunt’s HaveIBeenPwned database. Based on the results, I came to conclusion that this is not just another ‘Collection’ of previously leaked sources but a completely unique set of data. Although, not all records contained the detailed profile information about the email owner, a large amount of records were very detailed. We are still talking about millions of records.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started to analyze the content in an attempt to identify the owner and responsibly disclose it – even despite the fact that this started to look very much like a spam organization dataset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the email databases this unprotected Mongo instance it also uncovered details on the possible owner of the database – a company named ‘Verifications.io’ – which offered the services of ‘Enterprise Email Validation’. Unfortunately, it appears that once emails were uploaded for verification they were also stored in plain text. Once I reported my discovery to Verifications.io the site was taken offline and is currently down at the time of this publication. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190227230352/https://verifications.io/&quot;&gt;Here is the archived version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-349&quot; src=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1898&quot; height=&quot;845&quot; srcset=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2.jpg 1898w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2-300x134.jpg 300w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2-768x342.jpg 768w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic2-1024x456.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1898px) 100vw, 1898px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point I teamed up with Vinny Troya, owner of NightLion Security with whom I worked on other projects previously and who had a similar experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/&quot;&gt;finding the Exactis database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; . I also sent a data breach notification email to the company’s support (yes, I decided it is a right thing to do).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-352&quot; src=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; srcset=&quot;https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic4.jpg 718w, https://securitydiscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pic4-300x236.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After researching more about Verifications.io online and comparing the information that was publicly available in the database we have come to the following conclusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How this all works&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Someone uploads a list of email addresses that they want to validate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Verifications.io has a list of mail servers and internal email accounts that they use to “validate” an email address.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;They do this by literally sending the people an email. If it does not bounce, the email is validated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it bounces, they put it in a bounce list so they can easily validate later on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the scenario:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mr. Threat Actor” has a list of 1000 companies that he wants to hack into. He has a bunch of potential users and passwords, but has no idea which ones are real. He could try to log in to a service or system using ALL of those accounts, but that type of brute force attack is very noisy and would likely be identified. Instead, he uploads all of his potential email addresses to a service like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;verifications.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The email verification service then sends tens of thousands of emails to validate these users (some real, some not). Each one of the users on the list gets their own spam message saying “hi”. Then the threat actor gets a cleaned, verified, and valid list of users at these companies. Now he knows who works there and who does not, and he can start a more focused phishing or brute forcing campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The database(s) included email accounts they use for sending mail as well as hundreds of SMTP servers, email, spam traps, keywords to avoid, IP addresses to blacklist, and more. This is why I initially thought they were potentially engaged in spam related activities. It turns out that technically they actually are sending unwanted and unsolicited emails. This is the worst kind of spam because they send millions of completely worthless “hello” emails that no one can understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I mentioned they did act fast and the database was taken down the same day I sent notification email to the company’s support. Ironically, they did reply to my notification. In the response they identified that what I had discovered was public data and not client data, so why close the database and take the site offline if it indeed was “public”? In addition to the email profiles this database also had access details and a user list of (130 records), with names and credentials to access FTP server to upload / download email lists (hosted on the same IP with MongoDB). We can only speculate that this was not meant to be public data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can read more details about this discovery that was featured in: Wired – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/email-marketing-company-809-million-records-exposed-online/&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;12ff&quot; id=&quot;12ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I was always interested in economics. However until a few years ago I never really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money. However, I highly recommend that you invest some time to understand the basic foundations of how the economy works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ead3&quot; id=&quot;ead3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Andrew Lo, an MIT economist, said that while physics has three laws that explain 99% of the phenomena, finance has 99 laws that explain only 3%. Not only do we not fully understand how the economy works but also there is an endless debate on how it should function. Everyone has values and an ideology even if they don’t tell you. You should keep that in mind while studying economics. In this roadmap I try to recommend the tools easily available and that are a part of the current economic thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8019&quot; id=&quot;8019&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you have any comment, question or critique you can find me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/unbalancedparen&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/unbalancedparen&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/unbalancedparen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4b79&quot; id=&quot;4b79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;How the economic machine works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ray Dalio, founder of the biggest hedge fund in the world, created this 30 minute video called &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How the Economic machine works&lt;/a&gt;. In this video he shares his template to understand how the the economy works. What is taught in this video is simple but really important. Don’t just watch it, study it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;cd6f&quot; id=&quot;cd6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;Investopedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fc29&quot; id=&quot;fc29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Dalio’s video connects many concepts like transactions, market, central bank, monetary policy, fiscal policy, debt, collateral, credit, interest rate, inflation, deflation, productivity, economic cycles, deleveraging, recession and depression. If you don’t know what any of these words means or if you have doubts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/search&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/search&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; them. In most cases Investopedia will have simple and more begginner friendly definitions than Wikipedia. Also in general at the end of each article you can view useful examples and related concepts that it are useful to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a79b&quot; id=&quot;a79b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1027&quot; id=&quot;1027&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Some time ago I saw an interview with an old priest that has dedicated his life to keeping the Latin language alive. The interviewer asked him: “Why are you so good at Latin?”. The priest answered: “Do you see where I am sitting on? My butt. You sit on your butt and study Latin as long as I have. You’ll be a master too”. So the general idea is that it takes time master something, but anybody can do it. My biggest recommendation to learn more about economics and finance is to get a subscription for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;. Read the Financial Times every day, specially the Markets and Opinions sections. Read the weekly Economist magazine, especially the Finance and Economics section. It’s like working out, after some time you will see big changes but you won’t be able to see them by doing short-term comparisons. Learning and reading about the financial and economic situation of different countries of the world can be overwhelming at the beginning. Geopolitics is closely related to economics. These three Youtube channels are great for making sense of what you read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwnKziETDbHJtx78nIkfYug&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwnKziETDbHJtx78nIkfYug&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caspian Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT3v6vL2H5HK4loLMc8pmCw&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT3v6vL2H5HK4loLMc8pmCw&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VisualPolitik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmmPgObSUPw1HL2lq6H4ffA&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmmPgObSUPw1HL2lq6H4ffA&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geography Now&lt;/a&gt;. Geography Now is almost exclusively about geography but it is great to watch when you are reading news about a part of the world you don’t know much about. Caspian Report is the most profound of the three and tries to explain the deep structural reasons for what happens in the world. VisualPolitik doesn’t go as deep in the analysis as Caspian Report and has a noticeable political agenda but it is useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1022&quot; id=&quot;1022&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My recommendation is that you avoid at all costs watching TV channels like CNBC or any newspaper that focus only on daily news. We live in a world without flavor, dominated by clickbait news and post-truth politics. Deep, slow to digest, opinionated analyses are hard to come by. I prefer to read anything that makes me think even if it is written by somebody that thinks or has opposite values to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8204&quot; id=&quot;8204&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;Macroeconomic courses and books (optional)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb45&quot; id=&quot;eb45&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;To better learn the concepts that where mentioned by Ray Dalio’s video you should follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khan’s Academy Macroeconomics course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;60f1&quot; id=&quot;60f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I am not a big fan of textbooks since I find them way too schematic, but if you want to advance in the subject you will need to read one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1753460.Principles_of_Economics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1753460.Principles_of_Economics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mankiw’s Principles of Economics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367710.Macroeconomics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367710.Macroeconomics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Krugman’s Macroeconomy&lt;/a&gt; are the most basic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1308531.Macroeconomics&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1308531.Macroeconomics&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blanchard’s Macroeconomics&lt;/a&gt; is a little bit more advanced. I am giving many options since you will probably find one of the three books at your library. Keep in mind that studying one of this textbooks is not needed to advance in studying finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ff95&quot; id=&quot;ff95&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Finance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;866b&quot; id=&quot;866b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;Learn basic finance to invest your own money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5420&quot; id=&quot;5420&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The first thing I recommend that you do is to follow Nobel prize Robert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shiller’s Financial Markets course&lt;/a&gt;. The course covers stocks, bonds, dividends, markets, brokers, exchanges, bubbles and basic financial market history. He explains things in a simple and concise way. With this course you will get a basic understanding of what finance is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69bc&quot; id=&quot;69bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The next step on your journey should be to get some practical experience. The best way to do this is to open a brokerage account to invest some of your own money. Fees and safety should be the main considerations when choosing which broker to use. Also your nationality and where you live are big factors when choosing a broker. I had good experiences with Interactive Brokers, Saxo Bank and DEGIRO. Robinhood is a new player that you should check out too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5903&quot; id=&quot;5903&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After opening your brokerage account you should decide what you want to invest in. The first book I recommend reading is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119024927/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1119024927&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aweaofcomsen-20&amp;amp;linkId=33NCCDPJIVOFUTL5&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119024927/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1119024927&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aweaofcomsen-20&amp;amp;linkId=33NCCDPJIVOFUTL5&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Wealth of Common Sense&lt;/a&gt;. It is a very good book that explains how to create a simple framework to decide how to invest for the long term. A more dry and profound book to read that is pretty similar to the previous one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324002182&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/1324002182&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;. It is an excellent critique to the so-called technical analysis and it sums up the different investigations that have shown that humans are not rational investors. It is a good book that demonstrates that for the retail investors the best thing to do is to put their money in passive, low-fee investment vehicles instead of paying a money manager that charges a lot and doesn’t even deliver market returns. My biggest issue with the book it is that it adheres way too strongly to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Eugene Fama, another Nobel prize and one of the most important EMH adherents, said that &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“In an efficient market, at any point in time, the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value”&lt;/em&gt;. That means that in general there is no free money laying around or that getting above-average returns is really difficult. That is correct especially for the retail and individual investor. However as you will see in the advanced part of this roadmap I recommend books that are critical of this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a52&quot; id=&quot;5a52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Two great books that explain more complex investment strategies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25029029&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25029029&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Asset Allocation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21518331-global-value&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21518331-global-value&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Value&lt;/a&gt;. The Global Asset Allocation shows how diversifying your portfolio outside bonds and stocks can be useful. Global Value Allocation shows how investing in countries that are cheap, measured by fundamentals like the Price/Earnings ratio, gets your great returns in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1ff&quot; id=&quot;f1ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With Shiller’s course and these four books plus your broker account you should be perfectly able to invest your money in an intelligent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1ee5&quot; id=&quot;1ee5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Financial theory and derivatives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16c7&quot; id=&quot;16c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;At the beginning, learning about futures, swaps, options or derivatives can be overwhelming. Before stepping into more technical grounds I recommend that you read about the history of hedge funds with their successes and failures to understand what they did and how. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/more-money-than-god-sebastian-mallaby/1100257890&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/more-money-than-god-sebastian-mallaby/1100257890&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of A New Elite&lt;/a&gt; by Mallaby does just that. A quote from the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;6f58&quot; id=&quot;6f58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Weymar looked to his teachers for help in refining his mathematical and computing skills, he was unimpressed by their efficient-market theories. “I thought random walk was bullshit,” he said later. “The whole idea that an individual can’t make serious money with a competitive edge over the rest of the market is wacko.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22ea&quot; id=&quot;22ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;As you can see, this book goes in the opposite direction than A Random Walk Down Wall Street. The success of the main protagonists depends on finding market inefficiencies, they are not believers in efficient market hypothesis. Thanks to a hedge fund called Quantopian that provides data, a development platform and education, you can write your own investment algorithms and backtest them to find this type of small market inefficiencies. Their free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantopian.com/lectures&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.quantopian.com/lectures&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lectures&lt;/a&gt; are a great resource that you should follow if you know how to code in Python and if you have some knowledge in probability and statistics. They will introduce you to futures, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, alpha and beta, factors, means reversion, pairs trading and long-short strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f6ab&quot; id=&quot;f6ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After following these lectures it is time to move on into learning about options. Options are difficult because you are leveraged, they react non-linearly to volatility changes, time plays a huge factor in their pricing and their payoff function can be convex or concave (if you don’t understand what these words mean don’t worry). You can be right about your bet but still lose money and the other way around. They are a counter-intuitive beast. You can create a strategy with options that looses money 99% of the time and still make enough money on the 1% case to recover everything that was lost and more. There are two books I have used to understand options. The first book I have read is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100827.Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivatives&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100827.Options_Futures_and_Other_Derivatives&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Options, Futures and Other Derivatives by John Hul&lt;/a&gt;. It is a textbook that explains all the moving parts of a trade that involves derivatives. A good thing about the book is that is has quite a few exercises after each chapter so that you can double-check you really understood what you have read. Since it was difficult for me to grasp everything I have read from Hul’s book, I decided to read a second book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119373.Option_Volatility_Pricing&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119373.Option_Volatility_Pricing&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Option Volatility &amp;amp; Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques&lt;/a&gt; that was written by Natenberg. The tone of the book felt like it was written by a practitioner. It was easier to digest. Hul’s book seemed a little bit more advance and I think it is better to read Natenberg book first and Hul’s book afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68da&quot; id=&quot;68da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After learning the theory you should do some paper trading and real trading with options and futures before moving on. Now it is time to switch from the technical side of things to learning more about the history of financial theory and its critics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665134.The_Mis_Behavior_of_Markets&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665134.The_Mis_Behavior_of_Markets&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence by Mandelbrot&lt;/a&gt; is a book that summarizes the history of modern financial theory. After that, it shows that modern financial theory doesn’t take into account big market moves that happen more frequently that what the theory predicts. At the end of the book Mandelbrot proposes other ways of modelling financial markets. I found the critique more interesting than the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bdcc&quot; id=&quot;bdcc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antifragile by Taleb&lt;/a&gt; is a book that summarizes many ideas that Taleb wrote in Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan. Similar to what Mandelbrot wrote, Taleb proposes that unpredictable events are far more frequent and influential than most models take into account. Therefore, we should build anything, including our financial strategies, in a manner that benefits from chaos rather than try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e71d&quot; id=&quot;e71d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After learning about the tools at your disposal and the dangers involved in trading with options it is time to learn how to really trade volatility. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945749-trading-volatility&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945749-trading-volatility&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trading Volatility by Bennett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5404804-volatility-trading&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5404804-volatility-trading&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Volatility Trading by Euan Sinclair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31867439-the-volatility-smile&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31867439-the-volatility-smile&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Volatility Smile by Emanuel Derman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204689.Dynamic_Hedging&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204689.Dynamic_Hedging&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dynamic Hedging by Nassim Taleb&lt;/a&gt; are the best books in the area.

&lt;h4 name=&quot;c0dd&quot; id=&quot;c0dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Other skills&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;58de&quot; id=&quot;58de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;At some point you need to learn more about financial accounting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqnKWu0g5ZUps_CbQ-JGtbI9&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqnKWu0g5ZUps_CbQ-JGtbI9&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aswath Damodaran has a great course&lt;/a&gt; about companies valuation that I recommend that you follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;db69&quot; id=&quot;db69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The modern monetary system can not be separated from the financial markets. This was deeply visible in the last financial crisis. It is important to understand how the banking and monetary system works from a practical point of view. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mehrling’s course&lt;/a&gt; is a great introduction to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;259e&quot; id=&quot;259e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;At last, probability and statistics are the best tools we have to assess an work with risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12042357-think-stats&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12042357-think-stats&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thinks Stats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/#contents&quot; data-href=&quot;http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/#contents&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Probabilistic Programming &amp;amp; Bayesian Methods for Hackers&lt;/a&gt; are the best practical books I can recommend to quickly learn probability and statistics.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 3:15 p.m. ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Arizona prosecutor has determined that Uber is not criminally liable in the death of a Tempe woman who was struck by a self-driving test car last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;After a very thorough review of all the evidence presented, this Office has determined that there is no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter,&quot; the Yavapai County Attorney's Office wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5759641/UberCrashYavapaiRuling03052019.pdf&quot;&gt;in a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office. Tempe is in Maricopa County, but Yavapai County took the case due to a potential conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking a bicycle across the road at night when she was fatally struck by a Volvo SUV outfitted with an Uber self-driving system in March 2018. The car had a human operator behind the wheel but was in computer control mode at the time of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six seconds before impact, the self-driving system classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY18MH010-prelim.pdf&quot;&gt;a preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; from the National Transportation Safety Board explained. While the system identified that an emergency braking maneuver was needed to mitigate a collision, the system was set up to not activate emergency braking when under computer control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the car's system relied on the human operator to intervene as needed. &quot;The system is not designed to alert the operator,&quot; the report notes. The driver swerved less than a second before the crash and did not brake until after impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arizona Republic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe-breaking/2018/06/21/uber-self-driving-car-crash-tempe-police-elaine-herzberg/724344002/&quot;&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; that the driver, 44-year-old Rafaela Vasquez, was streaming the television show &lt;em&gt;The Voice&lt;/em&gt; in the vehicle in the minutes before the crash. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/21/595941015/police-in-arizona-release-dashcam-video-of-fatal-crash-involving-self-driving-ca&quot;&gt;Video from a camera inside the car&lt;/a&gt; shows Vasquez looking down immediately before the crash, glancing up at the road from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasquez could face charges of manslaughter. The prosecutor's letter recommends expert analysis of the collision video that would show what the driver &quot;would or should have seen that night given the vehicle's speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber, which declined to comment for this story, could still be sued in civil court and be forced to pay damages. The government could also potentially pursue criminal charges against managers or employees of Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herzberg's family &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597850303/uber-reaches-settlement-with-family-of-arizona-woman-killed-by-driverless-car&quot;&gt;reached a settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the company shortly after the crash. Her husband and daughter have also sued the city of Tempe, alleging that a brick pathway that crosses the landscaping was designed for people to cross at the accident site, the &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2019/03/05/no-criminal-charges-uber-fatal-tempe-crash-tempe-police-further-investigate-driver/3071369002/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The city has since torn out the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor whose research focuses on automated driving systems, suggests not reading too much into the prosecutor's letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not necessarily exculpatory — it doesn't exonerate Uber or put the company's conduct then or now beyond criticism,&quot; he writes in an email to NPR. &quot;And I'm not sure it tells us much about the criminal, much less civil, liability of automated driving developers in future incidents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith says he hopes the NTSB's final report on the crash will illuminate more about the crash. &quot;And I would still like to see Uber publicly apologize and explain what specifically went wrong,&quot; he says. &quot;Companies should earn our trust in part by being candid about their failures as well as their successes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;I realize that this question most likely doesn't have a specific answer, but it's an interesting thought experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;How many words are needed to form a basis that can be used to define all other words? Once a word that's not in the original basis has been defined, it can be used to define other words.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continues to Build End-to-End Travel Platform&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delivering on Commitment to Bring Magical Travel to Everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Airbnb’s mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. To advance our mission, we are reimagining travel by building an end-to-end travel platform that combines where you stay, what you do, and how you get there, all in one place. Today, we are building on this work by signing an agreement to acquire HotelTonight. HotelTonight is a hotel-booking service focused on making last-minute trips easy and fun, offering guests seamless, on-demand booking for boutique and independent hotels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big part of building an end-to-end travel platform is serving every guest, whether they plan their trip a year or a day in advance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working with the incredible team at HotelTonight, we will offer guests an unparalleled last-minute travel experience that provides unique, memorable hospitality on every trip, on any schedule, at any time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Chesky, Airbnb Co-Founder, CEO and Head of Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Airbnb has built an unrivaled global community of hosts and guests—we can connect travelers to more than 6 million places to stay and tens of thousands of incredible experiences around the world. Airbnb “is now the most searched-for accommodations brand” according to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/291386/Glamping-as-an-asset-class-Google-misspelling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;one Google executive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and guests are using Airbnb for every kind of trip, including business and last-minute travel. Today, more than 400,000 companies are using Airbnb to help manage their travel, and same-day bookings are now growing 2x year over year. Welcoming more boutique hotels to our platform will help us deliver on our commitment to make Airbnb for everyone, providing guests the authentic, local experience they have come to expect on every trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started HotelTonight because we knew people wanted a better way to book an amazing hotel room on-demand, and we are excited to join forces with Airbnb to bring this service to guests around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together, HotelTonight and Airbnb can give guests more choices and the world’s best boutique and independent hotels a genuine partner to connect them with those guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Shank, Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO of HotelTonight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The acquisition of HotelTonight:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Accelerates our work to build an end-to-end travel platform that serves everyone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are making it easier for people who use Airbnb to find last-minute places to stay when Home hosts are often already booked. The availability of boutique hotels—in addition to private rooms and entire homes that are instantly bookable—helps ensure authentic, high-quality stays are available on-demand, especially at the last minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;HotelTonight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;team has developed deep relationships with boutique hotels and expertise in seamless, last-minute booking.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;HotelTonight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is rooted in the same kinds of hospitality properties we have welcomed to the Airbnb community, and these boutique and independent hotels contribute the majority of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;HotelTonight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Meets enormous demand from—and for—boutique hotels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing number of hoteliers take inspiration from our Home hosts, making their boutique hotels more unique with custom touches. Last year,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.airbnb.com/airbnb-unveils-roadmap-to-bring-magical-travel-to-everyone/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;we announced our intent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/b/hotels&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;make it easier for these boutique hotels to list on our platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’ve had an overwhelming response from hoteliers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;with strong ties to their local communities who want to offer truly personal hospitality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: in 2018, we more than doubled the number of rooms available on Airbnb in properties that hosts categorized as boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, and other hospitality venues like hostels and resorts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve also seen Airbnb guests respond enthusiastically to this increased supply, booking three times as many nights with boutique hotels in 2018 compared with 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together with HotelTonight, we can offer places to stay for every type of traveler on all kinds of trips and make it easier for small businesses and hoteliers who take pride in providing authentic, unique experiences to tap into Airbnb’s truly global network of hosts and guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Supports Home hosts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we have welcomed boutique hotels to Airbnb, we’ve been delighted to see the positive impact for our Home hosts. The acquisition of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;HotelTonight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;will accelerate that positive benefit. Boutique hotels are helping to bring new guests to Airbnb and making our community larger and stronger. Once these new guests come to Airbnb, they’re returning to book with our Home hosts: in fact, nearly 90 percent of guests who first used Airbnb to book a hotel room and returned to our platform for a second trip then booked a home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to continue our work to grow our community and make Airbnb for everyone. The HotelTonight app and website will continue to operate as they do today. Once the acquisition is complete, Sam Shank will report to Greg Greeley, Airbnb’s President of Homes, and lead our boutique hotel category.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scheduling in React</title>
<link>https://philippspiess.com/scheduling-in-react/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://philippspiess.com/scheduling-in-react/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In modern applications, user interfaces often have to juggle multiple tasks at the same time. For example, a search component might need to respond to user input while providing auto completion results, and an interactive dashboard might need to update charts while loading data from the server and sending analytics data to a backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these parallel steps can lead to slow and unresponsive interfaces and unhappy users, so let’s learn how we can fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduling in User Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our users expect immediate feedback. Whether they are clicking on a button to open a modal or adding text to an input field, they don’t want to wait before seeing some kind of confirmation. For example, the button could show a modal and the input field could display the key that was typed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize what happens when this is not the case, let’s take a look at the demo application that Dan Abramov presented at his talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html&quot;&gt;Beyond React 16&lt;/a&gt;, at JSConf Iceland 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application works like this: The more you type into the input below, the more detailed the charts below will get. Since both of the updates (the input element and the chart) run at the same time, the browser has to do so much computation that it will drop some frames. This leads to noticeable delays and a bad user experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a version that prioritizes updating the input with new keystrokes will appear to the end user as though it’s running a lot faster. This is because users receive immediate feedback even though the same computation time is required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, current user interface architectures make it non-trivial to implement prioritization. One way to work around this problem is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function&quot;&gt;debouncing&lt;/a&gt; the chart update. The problem with this approach is that the charts still render synchronously when the debounced callback fires, which will again cause the user interface to be unresponsive for some time. We can do better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Browser Event Loop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we learn more about how proper prioritizing of updates can be achieved, let’s dig deeper and understand why the browser has issues with these kind of user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript code is executed in one thread, meaning that only one line of JavaScript can be run at any given time. The same thread is also responsible for other document lifecycles, like layout and paint.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;/&gt; This means that whenever JavaScript code runs, the browser is blocked from doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the user interface responsive, we only have a very short timeframe before we need to be able to receive the next input events. At the Chrome Dev Summit 2018, Shubhie Panicker and Jason Miller gave a talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/schedule/scheduling-on-off-main-thread&quot;&gt;A Quest to Guarantee Responsiveness&lt;/a&gt;. During the talk, they showed the following visualization of the browser’s run loop, in which we can see that we only have 16ms (on a typical 60Hz screen) before the next frame is drawn and the next event needs to be processed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/5854f/event-loop-browser.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;The browser event loop starts by running input handlers. Then it runs animation frame callbacks, and it ends with document lifecycles (style, layout, paint). All of this should complete within one frame, which is approximately 16ms on a 60Hz display.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/26338/event-loop-browser.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/fd659/event-loop-browser.png 175w, /static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/bbe02/event-loop-browser.png 350w, /static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/26338/event-loop-browser.png 700w, /static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/efbfc/event-loop-browser.png 1050w, /static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/42736/event-loop-browser.png 1400w, /static/805b72e5fe22f38f3f794de9668a14cc/5854f/event-loop-browser.png 1692w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most JavaScript frameworks (including the current version of React) will run updates synchronously. We can think of this behavior as a function &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; that will only return once the DOM is updated. During this time, the main thread is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems with Current Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the information above, we can formulate two problems that we have to solve in order to get to more responsive user interfaces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-running tasks cause frame drops.&lt;/strong&gt; We need to make sure all of our tasks are small and can be completed within a couple of milliseconds so that we can run them within one frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different tasks have different priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; In the example application above, we saw that prioritizing the user input leads to a better experience overall. To do this, we need a way to define the order and to schedule tasks accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Concurrent React and the Scheduler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;⚠️ Warning: The following APIs are not yet stable and will change. I will do my best to keep this post updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement a properly scheduled user interface with React, we have to look into two upcoming React features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.305555555556&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;8.6966292134831&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrent React (also known as Time Slicing).&lt;/strong&gt; With the help of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCuYPiUIONs&quot;&gt;Fiber architecture&lt;/a&gt; rewrite that was released with React 16, React can now pause during rendering and yield&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;/&gt; to the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hear more about Concurrent React in the future. For now it is important to understand that when this mode is enabled, React will split the synchronous rendering of our React components into pieces that are run over multiple frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;➡️ With this feature, we’re able to split long-running rendering tasks into small chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;21.870359457867&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduler.&lt;/strong&gt; The general purpose cooperative main thread scheduler is developed by the React Core team and makes it possible to register callbacks with different priority levels in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this article, the priority levels are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Immediate&lt;/code&gt; for tasks that need to run synchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;UserBlocking&lt;/code&gt; (250ms timeout) for tasks that should run as the result of a user interaction (e.g. a button click).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; (5s timeout) for updates that don’t have to feel instantaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Low&lt;/code&gt; (10s timeout) for tasks that can be deferred but must still complete eventually (e.g. an analytics notification).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Idle&lt;/code&gt; (no timeout) for tasks that do not have to run at all (e.g. hidden offscreen content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeouts for each priority level are necessary to make sure that lower priority work still runs even if we have so much higher priority work to do that the higher priority work could run continuously. In scheduling algorithms, this problem is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;starvation&lt;/a&gt;. The timeouts give us the guarantee that every scheduled task will eventually run. For example, we won’t miss a single analytics notification, even if we have ongoing animations in our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the Scheduler will store all registered callbacks in a list ordered by the expiration time (which is the time at which the callback was registered plus the timeout of the priority level). Then, the Scheduler will itself register a callback that is run after the next frame is drawn by the browser.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-3&quot;/&gt; Within this callback, the Scheduler will execute as many of the registered callbacks as possible until it’s time to render the next frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;➡️ With this feature, we can schedule tasks with different priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scheduling in Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how we can use these features to make an app feel a lot more responsive. To do this, we’ll take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philipp-spiess/scheduletron3000&quot;&gt;ScheduleTron 3000&lt;/a&gt;, an app I built that allows users to highlight a search term in a list of names. Let’s take a look at the initial implementation first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;searchValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setSearchValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setSearchValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;SearchBox onChange&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;handleChange&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;NameList searchValue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;searchValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;SearchBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;inputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setInputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInputValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendAnalyticsNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input
      type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;inputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      onChange&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;handleChange&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

ReactDOM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;App &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ℹ️ This example uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html&quot;&gt;React Hooks&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not familiar with this new React feature, take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/s/j3zrqpzkr5&quot;&gt;CodeSandbox code&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you might wonder why we use two different state variables for this example. We’ll find out why this is needed in a bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out! Type a name (e.g. “Ada Stewart”) in the search box below and see how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice that the interface is not very responsive. To amplify the issue, I artificially slowed down the rendering time of the names list. And since this list is big, it has a significant impact on the application’s performance. This is not good 😰.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our users expect immediate feedback, but the app is unresponsive for quite some time after a keystroke. To understand what’s going on, let’s take a look at the DevTools’ Performance tab. Here’s a screenshot of a recording I made while I type the name “Ada” into the search box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/3e72c/devtools-sync.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Chrome DevTools that shows that the three keypress events take 733ms to render.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/26338/devtools-sync.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/fd659/devtools-sync.png 175w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/bbe02/devtools-sync.png 350w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/26338/devtools-sync.png 700w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/efbfc/devtools-sync.png 1050w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/42736/devtools-sync.png 1400w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/8b47e/devtools-sync.png 2100w, /static/d8e525b8fc31fdba90634f8577da8301/3e72c/devtools-sync.png 2576w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see there are a lot of red triangles, which is usually not a good sign. For every keystroke, we see a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;keypress&lt;/code&gt; event being fired. All three events run within one frame,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-5&quot;/&gt; which causes the duration of the frame to extend to &lt;strong&gt;733ms&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s way above our average frame budget of 16ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside this &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;keypress&lt;/code&gt; event, our React code will be called, which causes the input value and the search value to update and then send the analytics notification. In turn, the updated state values will cause the app to rerender down to every individual name. That’s quite a lot of work that we have to do, and with a naive approach, it would block the main thread!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step toward improving the status quo is to enable the unstable Concurrent Mode. This can be done by wrapping a part of our React tree with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;React.unstable_ConcurrentMode&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, like this&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-4&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;diff&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-diff&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-diff&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token deleted&quot;&gt;- ReactDOM.render(&amp;lt;App /&amp;gt;, container);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+ ReactDOM.render(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+  &amp;lt;React.unstable_ConcurrentMode&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+    &amp;lt;App /&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+  &amp;lt;/React.unstable_ConcurrentMode&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+  rootElement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token inserted&quot;&gt;+ );&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, enabling Concurrent Mode alone will not change the experience in our case. React will still receive both state updates at the same time, so there’s no way of knowing which is less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We instead want to set the input value first so that we only need to update the search box in the beginning. Updates to the search value and our analytics notification should happen later. To do this, we’re using an API exposed by the Scheduler package (which can be installed with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm i scheduler&lt;/code&gt;) to enqueue a lower priority callback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight has-highlighted-lines&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; unstable_next &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;scheduler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;SearchBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;inputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setInputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; event&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInputValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unstable_next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;      props&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendAnalyticsNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;inputValue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; onChange&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;handleChange&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the API we’re using, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;unstable_next()&lt;/code&gt;, all React updates will be scheduled with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; priority, which is lower then the default priority inside an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with this change, our input box already feels a lot more responsive, and frames no longer get dropped while we’re typing. Let’s take another look at the Performance tab together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/50025/devtools-normal.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Chrome DevTools that shows that React breaks the rendering work down into small chunks. All frames can be drawn very quickly, although the analytics notifications are still sent in the middle of the rendering work.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/26338/devtools-normal.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/fd659/devtools-normal.png 175w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/bbe02/devtools-normal.png 350w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/26338/devtools-normal.png 700w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/efbfc/devtools-normal.png 1050w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/42736/devtools-normal.png 1400w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/8b47e/devtools-normal.png 2100w, /static/a523aeacdf07611d54568ba07f655d9d/50025/devtools-normal.png 2580w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the long-running tasks are now broken down into smaller ones that can be completed within a single frame. The red triangles that indicate frame drops are also gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one thing that is still not ideal is that the analytics notification (highlighted in the above screenshot) is still executed with the rendering work. Since the users of our app do not see this task, we can schedule a callback with an even lower priority for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  unstable_LowPriority&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  unstable_runWithPriority&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  unstable_scheduleCallback
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;scheduler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendDeferredAnalyticsNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unstable_runWithPriority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;unstable_LowPriority&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unstable_scheduleCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sendAnalyticsNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we now use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sendDeferredAnalyticsNotification()&lt;/code&gt; in our search box component and take another look at the Performance tab with this change and scroll toward the end, we’ll see that our analytics are now sent after all rendering work has completed, and so all the tasks in our app are perfectly scheduled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/63a84/devtools-normal-and-low.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Chrome DevTools that show that React breaks the rendering work down into small chunks. Analytics are sent at the end after all rendering work has completed.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://philippspiess.com/static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/26338/devtools-normal-and-low.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/fd659/devtools-normal-and-low.png 175w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/bbe02/devtools-normal-and-low.png 350w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/26338/devtools-normal-and-low.png 700w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/efbfc/devtools-normal-and-low.png 1050w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/42736/devtools-normal-and-low.png 1400w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/8b47e/devtools-normal-and-low.png 2100w, /static/e5ef87ea4a1dc1f0ef5c1a52776ca343/63a84/devtools-normal-and-low.png 2578w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Limitations of the Scheduler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Scheduler, it’s possible to control in what order callbacks are executed. It’s built deep into the latest React implementation and works out of the box with Concurrent mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are two limitations of the Scheduler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Fighting.&lt;/strong&gt; The Scheduler tries to use all of the resources available. This causes issues if multiple instances of a scheduler run on the same thread and compete for resources. We need to ensure that all parts of our application will use the same instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing user-defined tasks with browser work.&lt;/strong&gt; Since the Scheduler runs in the browser, it only has access to the APIs the browser exposes. Document lifecycles like rendering or garbage collection can interfere with the work in an uncontrollable way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remove these limitations, the Google Chrome team is working together with React, Polymer, Ember, Google Maps, and the Web Standards Community to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spanicker/main-thread-scheduling&quot;&gt;Scheduling API in the browser&lt;/a&gt;. What an exciting time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent React and the Scheduler allow us to implement scheduling of tasks in our applications which will allow us to create highly responsive user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official release for these features will likely happen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html#react-16x-q2-2019-the-one-with-concurrent-mode&quot;&gt;Q2 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, you can play around with the unstable APIs, but be aware that they will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be among the first to know when these APIs change or when documentation for the new features is written, subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-react.org&quot;&gt;This Week in React ⚛️&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Notepad++ drops code signing for its releases</title>
<link>https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6.4-released.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.6.4-released.html</guid>
<description>&lt;ol id=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot; title=&quot;Home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;news/&quot; title=&quot;News&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;news/notepad-7.6.4-released.html&quot; title=&quot;Notepad++ 7.6.4 released&quot; class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;Notepad++ 7.6.4 released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;06 Mar 2019 14:33:00&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you install Notepad++ version 7.6.4, You might notice there's no more blue-trusted UAC popup. Here's the explanation for the reason that we remove code signing from Notepad++ :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 years ago DigiCert donated a 3 years code signing certificate to the project, and every good thing has its end, the certificate has been expired since the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to purchase another certificate with reasonable price. However I cannot use &quot;Notepad++&quot; as CN to sign because Notepad++ doesn’t exist as company or organization. I wasted hours and hours for getting one suitable certificate instead of working on essential thing - Notepad++ project. I realize that code signing certificate is just an overpriced masturbating toy for FOSS authors - Notepad++ has done without certificate for more than 10 years, I don’t see why I should add the dependency now (and be an accomplice of this overpricing industry). I decide to do without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean there’s no more security in Notepad++, but it will be less flexible for sure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SHA256 hash of Installer and other packages will be provided for every release as usual. Too bad for ugly yellow-orange UAC popup while installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notepad++ will check the SHA256 of all the components (SciLexer.dll, GUP.exe and nppPluginList.dll) used by the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown is supposed to work in v7.6.3, but the needed file isn't deployed correctly by the installer. The bug is fixed in this version. Additionally Markdown is available in every package from this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Commission's Free and Open Source Software Auditing Bug Bounty program is still in progress, few vulnerable issues and some crash bugs are identified and fixed in this release thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HackerOne&lt;/a&gt; team's help.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Black Hole Propulsion as Technosignature</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;When he was considering white dwarfs and neutron stars in the context of what he called ‘gravitational machines,’ Freeman Dyson became intrigued by the fate of a neutron star binary. He calculated in his paper of the same name (citation below) that gradual loss of energy through gravitational radiation would bring the two neutron stars together, creating a gravitational wave event of the sort that has since been observed. Long before LIGO, Dyson was talking about gravitational wave detection instruments that could track the ‘gravitational flash.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Colliding-Neutron-Stars-Produce-Gold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41867&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Colliding-Neutron-Stars-Produce-Gold.jpg 540w, https://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Colliding-Neutron-Stars-Produce-Gold-300x168.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observables of this kind, if we could figure out how to do it (and we subsequently have) fascinated Dyson, who was in this era (early 1960s) working out his ideas on Dyson spheres and the capabilities of advanced civilizations. As to the problematic merger of neutron stars in a ‘machine,’ he naturally wondered whether astrophysical evidence of manipulations of these would flag the presence of such cultures, noting that “…it would be surprising if a technologically advanced species could not find a way to design a nonradiating gravitational machine, and so to exploit the much higher velocities which neutron stars in principle make possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on in the conclusion to the “Gravitational Engines” paper to say this: “In any search for evidences of technologically advanced societies in the universe, an investigation of anomalously intense sources of gravitational radiation ought to be included.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for unusual astrophysical activity is part of what would emerge as ‘Dysonian SETI,’ or in our current parlance, the search for ‘technosignatures.’ It’s no surprise that since he discusses using binary black holes as the venue for his laser-based gravity assist, David Kipping should also be thinking along these lines. If the number of black holes in the galaxy were large enough to support a network of transportation hubs using binary black holes, what would be the telltale sign of its presence? Or would it be observable in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the methodology: A spacecraft emits a beam of energy at a black hole that is moving towards it, choosing the angles so that the beam returns to the spacecraft (along the so-called ‘boomerang geodesic’). With the beam making the gravitational flyby rather than the spacecraft, the vehicle can nonetheless exploit the kinetic energy of the black hole for acceleration. Huge objects up to planetary size could be accelerated in such a way, assuming their mass is far smaller than the mass of the black hole. No fuel is spent aboard the spacecraft which, using stored energy from the beam, continues to accelerate up to terminal velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipping likes to talk about the process in terms of a mirror. Because light loops around the approaching black hole and returns to the spacecraft, the black hole exhibits mirror-like behavior. Thus on Earth, if we bounce a ping-pong ball off a mirror, the ball returns to us. But if the mirror is moving towards us quickly, the ball returns faster because it has picked up momentum from the mirror. Light acts the same way, but light cannot return faster than the speed of light. Instead, in gaining momentum from the black hole, the light blueshifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exploit the gain in energy, and we can envision a sufficiently advanced civilization doing the same. If it can reach a black hole binary, it has gained an essentially free source of energy for continued operations in moving objects to relativistic speeds. Operations like these at a black hole binary result in certain effects, so there is a whisper of an observable technosignature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed the question with Kipping in a recent email exchange. One problem emerges at the outset, for as he writes: “The halo drive is a very efficient system by design and that’s bad news for technosignatures: there’s zero leakage with an idealized system.” But he goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major effect I considered in the paper is the impact on the black hole binary itself. During departure, one is stealing energy from the black binary, which causes the separation between the two dead stars to shrink slightly via the loss of gravitational potential energy. However, an arriving ship would cancel out this effect by depositing approximately the same energy back into the system during a deceleration maneuver. Despite this averaging effect, there is presumably some time delay between departures and arrivals, and during this interval the black hole binary is forced into a temporarily contracted state. Since the rate of binary merger via gravitational radiation is very sensitive to the binary separation, these short intervals will experience enhanced infall rates. And thus, overall, the binary will merge faster than one should expect naturally. It may be possible to thus search for elevated merger rates than that expected to occur naturally. In addition, if the highway system is not isotropic, certain directions are preferred over others, then the binary will be forced into an eccentric orbit which may also lead to an observational signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricky business, this, for a black hole binary in this formulation can be used not only for acceleration but deceleration. The latter potentially undoes the distortions caused by the former, though Kipping believes elevated merger rates between the binary pair will persist. Our technosignature, then, could be an elevated binary merger rate and excess binary eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also interested in directionality — was the spacecraft limited in where it could go? I learned that the halo drive would be most effective when moving in a direction that lies along the plane of the binary orbit. Traveling out of this plane is possible, though it would involve using onboard propellant to attain the correct trajectory. The potential of reaching the speed of the black hole itself remains, but excess stored energy would then need to be applied to an onboard thruster to make the course adjustment. Kipping says he has not run the numbers on this yet, but from the work so far be believes that a spacecraft could work with angles as high as 20 degrees out of the plane of the binary orbit and still reach an acceleration equal to that of the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on the halo drive, remember that Kipping has made available a video that you can access &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rFqL9CkNxXw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The other citations are Kipping, “The Halo Drive: Fuel-free Relativistic Propulsion of Large Masses via Recycled Boomerang Photons,” accepted at the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://coolworlds.astro.columbia.edu/halodrive_preprint.pdf&quot;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt;); and Dyson, “Gravitational Machines,” in A.G.W.

<title>PureOS is convergent</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Many Devices, One OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two big mobile OS vendors have been dreaming of convergence between laptop OS and mobile OS for a long time; dreaming of being able to make the same application code execute, and operate, both on mobile phones and laptops – adapting the applications to screen size and input devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purism is beating the duopoly to that dream, with PureOS: we are now announcing that Purism’s PureOS is convergent, and has laid the foundation for all future applications to run on both the Librem 5 phone and Librem laptops, from the same PureOS release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-62779&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-on-devices-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;Purism has one convergent operating system, PureOS. Google has two separate ones, ChromeOS and Android; Apple has two separate ones too, macOS and iOS.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-on-devices-1024x576.png 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-on-devices-300x169.png 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-on-devices-768x432.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purism has one convergent operating system, PureOS. Google has two separate ones, ChromeOS and Android; Apple has two separate ones too, macOS and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Convergence?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had an app on your phone that you wanted on your laptop, you’ve wanted convergence. Convergence is a term used to describe the similar functioning of an app across different platforms. Many companies are eager to have their software be convergent, because it brings a consistent look and feel, as well as the exact same functionality for apps that run on your phone and your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergence can be really handy, since it allows you to use the apps you’re already familiar with, as well as the data that you’ve already synced. Convergence also brings plenty of of benefits to developers, such as writing your app once, testing it once and running it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is the ideal dream, why don’t we have convergence already? Why can’t a person run the exact same app on a phone and laptop today? It turns out that this is really hard to do unless you have complete control of software source code and access to hardware itself. Even then, there is a catch; you need to compile software for both the phone’s CPU and the laptop CPU which are usually different architectures. This is a complex process that often reveals assumptions made in software development but it shows that to build a truly convergent device you need to design for convergence from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching convergence is one more checked item on the list that Purism’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/purism-origin-story/&quot;&gt;founder envisioned&lt;/a&gt; when he created the company, specifically to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…manufacture a mobile phone from the schematics on up that would run that same ethical operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How We Got There&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right path to get us here was starting with the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;universal operating system&lt;/a&gt;” as the foundation of PureOS, Purism’s operating system. Running on so many different CPU architectures is a huge benefit, because very often laptops need a power-hungry and fast CPU, while a phone needs a power-aware, battery-saving CPU. These CPUs are, consequently, designed differently for their different uses, and you often have to “port” or cross-compile software for it to work well on both CPUs. By basing PureOS on a solid, foundational operating system – one that has been solving this performance and run-everywhere problem for years – means there is a large set of packaged software that “just works” on many different types of CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above example is already built into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/blob/master/NEWS#L74&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;master branch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GNOME Web&lt;/a&gt; as a class-based modification to the existing code, allowing it to easily adjust and adapt to the screen size and inputs of both mobile and desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adaptive Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple architectures are not enough to reach convergence however – as most people know by now, there are many important parts in getting true convergence. A good example of the problem in website design space: if you’ve ever gone to a website on your phone that had tiny text which scrolled off your phone screen, you know that a regular web page, designed for a desktop computer, isn’t always suitable for your smaller screen phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web designers now have toolboxes to design web pages, which they adjust for mobile or desktop in order to get easier readability and use. A similar, but far more complex practice, is required for software apps and defined by Purism as “adaptive design”. Purism is hard at work on creating adaptive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt; apps – and the community is joining this effort as well – apps that look great, and work great, both on a phone and on a laptop. Combining the work of the free software ecosystem with Purism’s contributions means we can target convergence for all our Librem hardware line: both the 13″ and 15″ laptops and the 5″ phone. This means we can get the most out of the ecosystem for the community: convergent apps will be easier to maintain, and therefore easier to secure. They will also be easier to build, enabling a vibrant community to build cool stuff that is free software and protects your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

As the window resizes, the column width dynamically changes to preserve a legible line width, until the sidebar and message view don’t fit at the same time. At this point the leaflet folds, only the message view is visible, and a back button is added to the header-bar, to allow navigation to the room list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Convergence Features into Existing Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can tap into convergence through the tools we actively use, contribute to, and develop directly in the ecosystem. We’ve created libhandy, a mobile and adaptive presentation library for GTK+ and GNOME, which is under active development. Packaged in PureOS and Debian already, you can also use it in flatpaks, simply by including it in your flatpak maniphest in Builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to provide convergence well before any of the other mobile OS vendors. Let’s see how long it takes for them to catch-up. Thank you for your continued support!&lt;/p&gt;
