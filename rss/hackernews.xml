<title>The State of Apple&amp;#039;s Developer Documentation</title>
<link>https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/05/20/the-state-of-apples-developer-documentation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/05/20/the-state-of-apples-developer-documentation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sanguish/status/1130012546772160512&quot;&gt;Scott Anguish&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://twitter.com/sanguish/status/1130012546772160512&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that most of the old iOS conceptual documents have been moved to the documentation archive and are now unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there really no iOS Text Programming concepts? Or are the indexes just that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is more than a decade of work by dozens, just being abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t even grasp how that’s any solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the case every single iOS developer should be screaming from the rafters. It’s by far the stupidest move I’ve seen in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t write apps without authoritative docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough the reference doc has reached the point it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s surprising how much of the documentation is marked as legacy, archived, not up-to-date, or was never written in the first place. At first I thought this was because of some sort of internal transition, but it’s been going on for years now and does not seem to be getting any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevex/status/1130062117946777607&quot;&gt;Steve Tibbett&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevex/status/1130062117946777607&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, this is the only documentation on IAP receipt validation. This is part of a current system that’s making Apple billions of dollars. There are errors in it, and it’s “no longer being updated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pilky/status/1130057224775249920&quot;&gt;Martin Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://twitter.com/pilky/status/1130057224775249920&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I was looking up docs for Help Books for my Appreciating AppKit post, one of the few Mac features already supported in Marzipan, it took ages to find as they’re only available in the documentation archive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattstevens/status/1015635883951718400&quot;&gt;Matt Stevens&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattstevens/status/1015635883951718400&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to find an Apple developer document you know exists, it’s not just you. http://developer.apple.com’s robots.txt disallows /library/archive/, where all of the old docs now live. Apple’s own “Search Documentation Archive”…doesn’t search the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>DeleteFB: Selenium script to delete all of your Facebook wall posts</title>
<link>https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a simple and reliable way to delete Facebook posts. There are third-party apps that claim to do this, but they all require handing over your credentials, or are unreliable in other ways. Since this uses Selenium, it is more reliable, as it uses your real web browser, and it is less likely Facebook will block or throttle you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why you would want to do this in the first place. That is up to you. Personally I wanted a way to delete most of my content on Facebook without deleting my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; delete posts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make no guarantees that Facebook doesn't store the data somewhere forever in cold storage. However this tool is intended more as a way to clean up your online presence and not have to worry about what you wrote from years ago. Personally, I did this so I would feel less attached to my Facebook profile (and hence feel the need to use it less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and that it is up to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also install the chromedriver for Selenium. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. On Arch Linux you can find this in the &lt;code&gt;chromium&lt;/code&gt; package, and on Ubuntu it is &lt;code&gt;chromium-chromedriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip3 install --user delete-facebook-posts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;deletefb -E &quot;youremail@example.org&quot; -P &quot;yourfacebookpassword&quot; -U &quot;https://www.facebook.com/your.profile.url&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script will log into your Facebook account, go to your profile page, and start deleting posts. If it cannot delete something, then it will &quot;hide&quot; it from your timeline instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient as it will take a very long time, but it will eventually clear everything. You may safely minimize the chrome window without breaking it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2FA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have 2-Factor Auth configured then the script will pause for 20 seconds to allow you to enter your code and log in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Install Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on installing with Brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your native package manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, but I make no guarantees that Selenium will actually work as I have not tested it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it stops working or otherwise crashes, delete the latest post manually and start it again after waiting a minute. I make no guarantees that it will work perfectly for every profile. Please file an issue if you run into any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c-lead-image__attribution&quot; itemprop=&quot;creator&quot;&gt;Madison McVeigh/CityLab&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;l-article__dek o-small-container&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;It’s time to end the tyranny of open-concept interior design.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If someone asked me five years ago whether or not I thought the open floor plan would still be popular, I would have said no. Domestic architecture seemed to be taking a turn toward the rustic. Today, “Farmhouse” and “Craftsman” modern designs, harkening back to the American vernacular tradition (complete with shiplap walls), are a tour-de-force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But I would have been wrong. Although these houses bring all the exterior trappings of beloved vernacular houses of the past, they do not extend that to the interior plans. In fact, the open concepts from the oversized houses of the pre-recession era have only gotten &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Much has been written about the open floor plan: how it came to be, why it is bad (or good), whether it should or shouldn’t be applied to existing housing. The open floor plan as we currently understand it—an entry-kitchen-dining-living combination that avoids any kind of structural separation between uses—is only a few decades old. Prior to the last 25 years, an “open floor plan” meant a living configuration without &lt;em&gt;doors&lt;/em&gt;; now the term has come to mean a living configuration without &lt;em&gt;walls&lt;/em&gt;. I will refer to the latter from now on as an “open concept,” in order to differentiate it from a traditional open floor plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/AP_051007018677/01f7b92fc.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;An open-concept house in Massachusetts in 2005. (Michael Dwyer/AP)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot; readability=&quot;57.951219512195&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interior-wall-free open concept became popular starting in the 1970s, evolving from the cedar contemporary homes known for their tall ceilings and windows, and from &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=fjbaCwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA695&amp;amp;lpg=PA695&amp;amp;dq=%22styled+ranch%22+house&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=cD9mPadV7W&amp;amp;sig=BvSRH7FP6ztIGADg6-lI91CsPfE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI4IWkmNbbAhWMqlMKHWjEDjEQ6AEIZzAM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22styled%20ranch%22%20house&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;styled ranches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; whose steeper rooflines allowed for newly in-vogue cathedral ceilings. Overall, the open concept was a reaction against years of small, low-ceilinged living, which felt restricting and stuffy to a new generation of homebuyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot; readability=&quot;69.560580204778&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/05/the-curse-of-an-open-floor-plan/560561/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Ian Bogost described a new luxury concept called the “mess kitchen”—a second kitchen out of sight from the main kitchen and the rest of the open plan. He cited it to demonstrate why the open floor plan and its rhetoric around “entertaining” have reached new levels of absurdity. However, to me, the mess kitchen offers hope for a transitional period where open spaces may become closed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;That this would start with the kitchen is not surprising. Historically, the kitchen was the last room to be integrated into the open concept. Living and dining rooms began to converge as early as the beginning of the 1900s, when changes in architectural taste and the development of mass-industrialized housing production favored a more compact home design than the rambling, formal “hall-and-parlor” layout of Victorian times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional narrative is that, historically, houses had floor plans that were closed, and then they began opening up. But it is important to understand that this argument centers on the homes of the affluent classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/GettyImages_534248364/db3019d8e.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Meeting of aristocratic families in the living room.

&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wealthy families in the 18th and 19th centuries had homes with several rooms for specific purposes, such as parlors, libraries, drawing rooms, smoking rooms, and servants’ quarters. Then, new building materials and construction technologies led to shifts in architectural taste that favored more continuous interior spaces: First came the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts movement, then Modernism. Social changes that arose with modern industrial capitalism, such as the transition away from live-in servants to commuting wage-workers, also reduced the number of rooms in upper-class houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot; readability=&quot;98.647887323944&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, in the homes of the working and lower-middle classes, these same factors of social change and modernization created an opposite progression. The story of common houses is a story of walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The number of rooms in working-class homes increased with the number of products and amenities that became readily affordable through industrialization, modernization, and mass production. The common house, as well as working-class living environments such as dwelling houses and tenements, only had one to three rooms: a kitchen space and a living and/or sleeping space, which were multipurpose, used for working as well as living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Beginning in the 1860s, work increasingly took place outside of the home, and the application of mass production to housing reduced building costs. During this period, the average number of rooms increased, to three to five: a kitchen, a living room, and one or two bedrooms. Common vernacular examples of this period (1860-1900) include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://moss-design.com/worker-cottage/&quot;&gt;worker’s cottage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_house&quot;&gt;the shotgun house&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upright_and_Wing&quot;&gt;Temple-and-Wing&lt;/a&gt; house, and early examples of the four-box and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antiquehomestyle.com/styles/foursquare.htm&quot;&gt;Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;. In these early industrial-era homes, the threshold between working-class and middle-class was determined by amenities like a dining room or a front porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the 1900s and 1910s, mass single-family housing shipped to the site by rail and truck had come into its own. Now sizes and types of wood, nails, and other construction materials had become widely standardized across the building industry. During the second half of the 19th century, a key development—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldhouseweb.com/how-to-advice/balloon-framing.shtml&quot;&gt;balloon framing&lt;/a&gt;—allowed for more inexpensive construction, since the cheap materials (nails, studs, and 2x4s) were readily available and did not required skilled labor to assemble, unlike timber framing. Long, lightweight studs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finehomebuilding.com/1998/03/01/the-process-of-balloon-framing&quot;&gt;the clever, basket-like technique&lt;/a&gt; of assembly enabled taller and longer homes to be built by as few as two people and with relatively little waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Two of the most common and recognizable types of vernacular American housing—the bungalow and the Foursquare—became massively popular during this time. The average number of rooms per house increased once again. Working-class homes now had three to five rooms; middle-class homes, six to eight. Whether or not a home was determined to be working- or middle-class depended on whether it had indoor plumbing (bathrooms!) or electricity, both of which had become increasingly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/377720pu/a0dc9e675.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Duplex bungalow built c. 1905 for cigar-factory workers in Tampa’s Ybor City. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-6&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Architectural historians place a great deal of emphasis on the bungalow, often citing it as the beginning of the “open” floor plan, since many bungalows omitted the closed wall between the living and dining areas. However, these historians focus on high-style Arts &amp;amp; Crafts bungalows, which featured more inventive architecture, and ignore the fact that in working-and-middle class bungalows, the average number of individual (closed) rooms increased as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Only in more elaborate middle-class bungalows is the wall between the living and dining room separated by a partial wall or colonnade. This feature was more expensive to construct, because it required structural loads to be redistributed to other walls or fixtures. Structural reasons in general were why, in common houses, open spaces would not become more widespread until changes in construction made them more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-7&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even as plans in elite houses continued to open up throughout the 1920s, the common house retained its interior walls. Why? In many respects, closed rooms existed to maintain a semblance of privacy. Homes were smaller, but families were bigger than they are now: The average number of people in an American household was five in 1880 and 4.3 in 1920; today, it’s 2.5. The reason why the first door to be omitted was frequently that between the living and dining rooms was because those rooms were considered “public” spaces, a holdover from the hall-and-parlor Victorian times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/3c29768u/874b12096.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Homes in Greenbelt, Maryland—a town built by the federal government for lower-income families in the 1930s—had separate kitchens, dining rooms, and living rooms, and many had three bedrooms, a luxury at the time. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-8&quot; readability=&quot;80.003745318352&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Work areas, such as the kitchen, and private spaces, like bedrooms and bathrooms, were always closed off to avoid guests seeing the mess of meal-making or, heaven forbid, the “unmentionable room” (the bathroom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the end of the 1920s, the large, old-growth trees that produced the long studs central to the technique of balloon framing became scarce, leading to new techniques that could be completed with smaller spans of wood. Today’s style of framing, platform framing,  enabled more flexible room shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The small &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcmansionhell.com/post/162212185966/looking-around-the-curious-case-of-minimal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal traditional houses&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s through early ‘50s employed this new framing technique on a mass, federally-subsidized scale. These small homes relied on interior walls to ensure spatial privacy (not to mention aural, olfactory, and visual privacy) in cramped situations. The closed floor plan also represented security, isolation, and control, concepts that were important in a moment that emerged from the Depression and then World War II, and deepened through a period of intense racial tension and Cold War paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-9&quot; readability=&quot;62&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The ranch and the split-level, both of which originated in the mid-1940s, drastically changed patterns of dwelling in the American home. This is often cited as the spark that lit the fire of the open concept. The reorientation of the ideal American home, from vertical, two-story Cape Cod to horizontal, one-story ranch, certainly did open up floor plans. By this point, a continuous living and dining space was commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/32700u/c260f118c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;The innovative 1948 Revere Quality House in Sarasota, Florida, designed by Ralph Twitchell and Paul Rudolph, had an L-shaped combination living/dining space; the kitchen was separated from the dining area by a partition. (Library of Congress)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-10&quot; readability=&quot;86&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, one room remained stubbornly closed for at least another decade: the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kitchens have been closed for most of the history of common housing. In elite houses, kitchens were places of work, where servants were kept out of sight of residents and guests, often relegated to the cellar or guesthouse. This functional separation was continued in middle-class houses, even as live-in servants became a feature of the past. Most kitchens are placed in the rear of the house. Access to a rear kitchen door allowed for faster disposal of waste and easy ventilation; also, deliveries could be made directly to the kitchen to save labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kitchens began to open up and become public spaces in the home because of cultural shifts regarding consumption. Domestic theorist Christine Frederick’s term “creative waste” sums up this new mentality: It was the moral obligation of the 1920s housewife to buy and discard products, one that elevated the concept of waste as being positive, indulgent, and stimulating to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This attitude merged with new technological advances. When inventions such as central air conditioning and improved fire suppression became commonplace, the kitchen, no longer a place of shame and no longer reliant upon the ventilation provided by the kitchen door, began to shift to different parts of the home. The attached garage often replaced the backyard as the common point of entry into the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Room layout, which more often than not had its roots in social and practical constraints, became liberated due to these new cultures of consumption and technologies of comfort. Without these developments, the open concept would have never been possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-11&quot; readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If closed floor plans are considered such a nuisance these days, why did they prevail for almost 100 years in single-family working- and middle-class suburban housing? The answer: closed floor plans make a lot of sense, from both an environmental and a living perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2018/08/GettyImages_517423330/e8bc51601.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;A 1950s model kitchen, with sink and stove a few steps apart. (Bettmann/Getty Images)
&lt;section class=&quot;s-article__section o-small-container&quot; id=&quot;article-section-12&quot; readability=&quot;97&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are going to need to consume a lot less energy if we want to stem the tide of global climate change. The good news is, humans survived for thousands of years without air conditioning and cars, and thus can learn some lessons from the past. The closed floor plan, especially the closed kitchen, can help save energy by the simple principle of not heating and cooling rooms that are not currently in use, as well as by isolating rooms we want to keep warm or cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As cultures of consumption change and people become more environmentally conscious, homes must change to reflect this. Designing homes around “entertaining” that happens only a handful of times a year is a wasteful, yet still mindbogglingly popular practice. When people come to visit, they are there to see you, not your open concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It may not be as glamorous, but the closed kitchen is actually more efficient for cooking than the sprawling, open “chef’s kitchens” that are so popular. It enables whoever does the cooking to take fewer steps to perform tasks. The chef’s kitchen follows the wasteful logic of the 1920s: Instead of moving the sink closer to the stove, builders install a pot filler or a second sink in a center island. Instead of closing in the main kitchen to isolate the disorder of food preparation, developers are building “mess kitchens” for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The “labor-saving” elements of open floor plans are in some ways labor-creating. A large, single, continuous space is harder to get and keep clean. Messes and smells are no longer isolated, but can be easily tracked throughout the entire first floor of a large home. Less house in general means less house to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Not separating cooking, living, and dining is also an acoustical nightmare, especially in today’s style of interior design, which avoids carpet, curtains, and other soft goods that absorb sound. This is especially true of homes that do not have separate formal living and dining spaces but one single continuous space. Nothing is more maddening than trying to read or watch television in the tall-ceilinged living room with someone banging pots and pans or using the food processor 10 feet away in the open kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

It offers what it has always offered: aural, olfactory, and spatial privacy. Humans have always needed the sense of comfort and refuge that defined rooms provide. That may explain the rise of “man caves” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwell.com/article/she-sheds-design-a4fa8409&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;she sheds&lt;/a&gt;”—closed spaces that rebel against the open concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Instead of these—space-wasting, specialized rooms that are used relatively sparingly—why not just build common rooms with walls and doors? If you want to escape something unpleasant, you can do so without feeling banished or isolating yourself from everyone else. Sometimes, true freedom means putting up a few barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Millions of Instagram influencers had their contact data scraped and exposed</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/instagram-influencer-celebrity-accounts-scraped/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/instagram-influencer-celebrity-accounts-scraped/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;A massive database containing contact information of millions of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; influencers, celebrities and brand accounts has been found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database, hosted by Amazon Web Services, was left exposed and without a password allowing anyone to look inside. At the time of writing, the database had over 49 million records — but was growing by the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a brief review of the data, each record contained public data scraped from influencer Instagram accounts, including their bio, profile picture, the number of followers they have, if they’re verified and their location by city and country, but also contained their private contact information, such as the Instagram account owner’s email address and phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hak1mlukha&quot;&gt;Anurag Sen&lt;/a&gt; discovered the database and alerted TechCrunch in an effort to find the owner and get the database secured. We traced the database back to Mumbai-based social media marketing firm Chtrbox, which pays influencers to post sponsored content on their accounts. Each record in the database contained a record that calculated the worth of each account, based off the number of followers, engagement, reach, likes and shares they had. This was used as a metric to determine how much the company could pay an Instagram celebrity or influencer to post an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch found several high-profile influencers in the exposed database, including prominent food bloggers, celebrities and other social media influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted several people at random whose information was found in the database and provided them their phone numbers. Two of the people responded and confirmed their email address and phone number found in the database was used to set up their Instagram accounts. Neither had any involvement with Chtrbox, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we reached out, Chtrbox pulled the database offline. Pranay Swarup, the company’s founder and chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment and several questions, including how the company obtained private Instagram account email addresses and phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scraping effort comes two years after Instagram admitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/hackers-are-selling-millions-of-instagram-celeb-accounts-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;a security bug in its developer API&lt;/a&gt; allowed hackers to obtain the email addresses and phone numbers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/hackers-make-searchable-database-to-dox-instagram-celebs&quot;&gt;six million Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt;. The hackers later sold the data for bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months later, Instagram — now with more than a billion users — &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/&quot;&gt;choked its API&lt;/a&gt; to limit the number of requests apps and developers can make on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it was looking into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re looking into the issue to understand if the data described – including email and phone numbers – was from Instagram or from other sources,” said an updated statement. “We’re also inquiring with Chtrbox to understand where this data came from and how it became publicly available,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional comments from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Employing QUIC Protocol to Optimize Uber’s App Performance</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uber operates on a global scale across more than 600 cities, with our apps relying entirely on wireless connectivity from over 4,500 mobile carriers. To deliver the real-time performance expected from Uber’s users, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication. Unfortunately, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;stack fares poorly in dynamic, lossy wireless networks, and we learned that poor performance can often be traced directly to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implementations buried in OS kernels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To address these pain points, we adopted the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a stream-multiplexed modern transport protocol implemented over UDP, which enables us to better control the transport protocol performance. QUIC is currently being standardized by the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(IETF) as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quicwg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After thorough testing of QUIC, we concluded that integrating QUIC in our apps would reduce the tail-end latencies compared to TCP. We witnessed a reduction of 10-30 percent in tail-end latencies for HTTPS traffic at scale in our rider and driver apps. In addition to improving the performance of our apps in low connectivity networks, QUIC gives us end-to-end control over the flow of packets in the user space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this article, we share our experiences optimizing TCP performance for Uber’s apps by moving to a network stack that supports the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State of the Art: TCP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On today’s Internet,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is the most widely adopted transport protocol for carrying HTTPS traffic. TCP provides a reliable byte stream, dealing with the complexities of network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;congestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and link layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The widespread use of TCP for HTTPS traffic is mainly attributed to ubiquity (almost every OS includes TCP), availability on a wide range of infrastructure, such as load balancers, HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;proxies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/content-distribution-network.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDNs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and it’s out-of-the-box functionality for most platforms and networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most users access Uber’s services on the move, and the tail-end latencies of our applications running on TCP were far from meeting the requirements of the real-time nature of our HTTPS traffic. Specifically, users perceived high tail-end latencies across the world. In Figure 1, below, we plot the tail-end latencies of our HTTPS network calls across major cities:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Tail-end latencies vary across the major cities where Uber operates.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the latencies in India and Brazil’s networks were worse than those in the US and UK, the tail-end latencies are significantly higher than the average latencies, even in the case of the US and UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TCP Performance over wireless&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TCP was originally designed for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;wired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;networks, which have largely predictable links. However,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;wireless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;networks have unique characteristics and challenges. Firstly, wireless networks are susceptible to losses from interference and signal attenuation. For instance, WiFi networks are susceptible to interference from microwaves, bluetooth, and other types of radio waves. Cellular networks are affected by signal loss (or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_loss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;path loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) due to reflection/absorption by things in the environment, such as buildings, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-channel_interference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;interference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;from neighboring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artizanetworks.com/resources/tutorials/what_lteenb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;base stations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These result in much higher (e.g: 4-10x) and variable Round-trip times (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RTTs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and packet loss than wired counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To overcome intermittent fluctuations in bandwidth and loss, cellular networks typically employ large buffers to absorb traffic bursts. Large buffers can cause excessive queueing, causing longer delays. TCP often interprets such queuing as loss due to time out durations, so it tends to retransmit and further fill up the buffer. This problem, known as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2071893&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bufferbloat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is a major&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/paper/cellnet/p1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in today’s Internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, cellular network performance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;varies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;significantly across carriers, regions, and time. In Figure 2, below, we plot the median latencies of HTTPS traffic in Uber’s rider app across hexagons of 2 kilometers for two major mobile carriers in Delhi, India. As can be seen in the figure, the network performance varies significantly across the hexagons in the same city. Also, the performance is significantly different for two of the top carriers. Factors such as user access patterns based on location and time, user mobility, and the network deployment of the carrier based on the density of the towers and the proportion of the types of networks (LTE, 3G, etc.) cause network load variations across location and carriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to varying across locations, the cellular network performance varies over time. As shown in Figure 3, below, the median latency across two kilometer hexagons for the same region within Delhi and the same carrier fluctuates across the days of the week. We also saw variations within finer time scales, such as within a day and an hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6102&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;145&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1.png 1822w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-300x73.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-768x186.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-1024x248.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-696x168.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-1068x259.png 1068w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 3: Tail-end latencies can vary considerably from day to day, on the same carrier.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above characteristics translate into inefficiencies in TCP’s performance on wireless networks. However, before looking into alternatives to TCP,  we wanted to develop a key understanding of the problem space by assessing the following considerations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is TCP the main contributor to the high tail-end latencies on our mobile applications?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do current networks have significantly high RTT variance and losses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the impact of the high RTTs and losses on the performance of TCP?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;TCP performance analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To better understand how we analyze TCP performance, let’s first briefly explain how TCP transfers data from a sender to a receiver. Initially, the sender sets up a TCP connection by performing a three-way&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;handshake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: the sender transmits a SYN packet, waits for a SYN-ACK packet from the receiver, then sends an ACK packet. An additional two to three round trips are spent on setting up a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;connection. Each data packet is ACKed by the receiver to ensure reliable delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case that a packet or ACK is lost, the sender retransmits the packet after the expiration of a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6298&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;retransmission timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(RTO). The RTO is dynamically computed based on various factors, such as the estimate of the RTT between the sender and the receiver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6111&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10.png 1419w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-300x162.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-768x416.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-1024x554.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-696x377.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-1068x578.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image10-776x420.png 776w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 4: TCP/TLS packet exchanges include a mechanism to retransmit lost packets.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine how the TCP flow was performing in our apps, we collected TCP packet traces using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcpdump.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for a week of production traffic from Uber’s edge servers for connections originating from India. We then analyzed the TCP connections using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcptrace.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcptrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In addition, we also built an Android application that sends emulated traffic to a test server closely mimicking real traffic. The application collects TCP traces in the background, and uploads the logs to a back-end server. Android phones running this application were handed out to a few employees in India, who collected logs for a period of a few days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results were consistent from both experiments. We witnessed high RTT values, and tail-end values being almost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;six times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;the median value, with an average variance of more than one second. Additionally, most connections were lossy, causing TCP to retransmit 3.5 percent of total packets. In congested locations, such as railway stations and airports, we witnessed as high as 7 percent of packets being dropped by the network. These results challenge a common notion that cellular networks’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharetechnote.com/html/BasicProcedure_LTE_HARQ.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;advanced retransmission schemes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;significantly reduce losses at the transport layer. Below, we outline our results running tests on our mock application:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTT in msecs [50%,75%, 95%,99%]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;[350, 425, 725, 2300]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTT variance in secs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average ~ 1.2 seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet Loss Rate in lossy connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;Average ~3.5% (7% in congestion areas)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost half of these connections saw at least one packet loss, with a significant number of connections suffering losses of SYN and SYN-ACK packets. Since TCP uses highly conservative RTO values for retransmitting SYN and SYN-ACK packets compared to data packets, most TCP implementations use an initial RTO of one second for SYN packets, with the RTO exponentially increased for subsequent losses. The initial load time of the application can suffer as TCP takes more time to setup the connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of data packets, high RTOs effectively reduce network utilization in the presence of transient losses in the wireless networks. We found that the average time to retransmit is around&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with tail-end times being almost 30 seconds. These high delays in the TCP layer were causing the HTTPS transfer to timeout and retry the request, leading to further latency and network inefficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the 75th percentile of the measured RTTs on our networks was around 425 milliseconds, the 75th percentile of TCP back-off was almost three seconds. This result implies that losses cause TCP to take 7 times-10 times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;round-trips to actually transmit the data successfully. This can be attributed to the inefficient computation of RTOs, TCP’s inability to react quickly to loss of last few packets in a window (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41217.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tail loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), and inefficiencies in the congestion control algorithm, which does not differentiate between wireless losses and losses due to network congestion. Below, we outline the results of our TCP packet loss tests:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adopting QUIC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Originally designed by Google,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is a stream-multiplexed modern transport protocol implemented over UDP.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, QUIC is being standardized as a part of an ongoing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.github.io/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-transport.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;IETF effort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As depicted in Figure 5, below, QUIC transparently sits under HTTP/3 (HTTP/2 over QUIC is being standardized as HTTP/3). It replaces portions of HTTPS and TCP layers on the stack, using UDP for packet framing. QUIC only supports secure data transmission, hence the TLS layer is completely embedded within QUIC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below, we outline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that made it compelling for us to adopt QUIC in addition to TCP for this edge communication:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0-RTT connection establishment:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC allows reuse of the security credential established in previous connections, reducing the overhead of secure connection handshakes by way of sending data in the first round trip. In the future,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/blog/tls13/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLS1.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;will support 0-RTT, but the TCP three-way handshake will still be required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming HoL blocking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;HTTP/2 uses a single TCP connection to each origin to improve performance, but this can lead to head-of-line (HoL) blocking. For instance, an object B (e.g, trip request) may get blocked behind another object A (e.g, logging request) which experiences loss. In this case, delivery of B is delayed until A can recover from the loss. However, QUIC facilitates multiplexing and delivers a request to the application independent of other requests that are being exchanged.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congestion control:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC sits in the application layer, making it easier to update the core algorithm of the transport protocol that controls the sending rate based on network conditions, such as packet loss and RTT. Most TCP deployments use the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos561/papers/Cubic08.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CUBIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;algorithm, which is not optimal for delay-sensitive traffic. Recently developed algorithms, such as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, model the network more accurately and optimize for latency. QUIC lets us enable BBR and update the algorithm as it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-iccrg-an-update-on-bbr-work-at-google-00&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evolves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC invokes two tail loss probes (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-01&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TLP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) before RTO is triggered even when a loss is outstanding, which is different from some TCP implementations. TLP essentially retransmits the last packet (or a new packet, if available) to trigger fast recovery. Tail loss handling is particularly useful for Uber’s network traffic patterns, which are composed of short, sporadic latency-sensitive transfers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized ACKing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt; Since each packet carries a unique sequence number, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2016/karns-algorithm/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of distinguishing retransmission from delayed packets is eliminated. The ACK packets also contain the time to process the packet and generate the ACK at the client level. These features ensure that QUIC more accurately estimates the RTT. QUIC’s ACKs support up to 256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/nack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NACK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;ranges, helping the sender to be more resilient to packet reordering and ensuring fewer bytes on the wire. Selective ACK (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SACK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) in TCP does not resolve this problem in all cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Migration:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;QUIC connections are identified by a 64 bit connection ID, so that if a client changes IP addresses, it can continue to use the old connection ID from the new IP address without interrupting any in-flight requests. This is a common occurrence in mobile applications when a user switches between WiFi and cellular connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Alternatives to QUIC considered&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before settling on QUIC, we looked into alternative approaches to improving TCP performance across our apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first tried deploying TCP Points of Presence (PoPs) to terminate the TCP connections closer to users. Essentially, PoPs terminates the TCP connection to the mobile device closer to the cellular network and reverse proxies the traffic to the original infrastructure. By terminating the TCP closer, we can potentially reduce the RTT, and ensure that TCP is more reactive to the dynamic wireless environment. However, our experiments proved that the bulk of the RTT and loss is coming from cellular networks and use of PoPs did not provide a significant performance improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also looked into tuning the parameters of TCP to improve app performance. Tuning TCP stacks across our heterogeneous edge servers was challenging, since TCP has disparate implementations across different versions of the OS. It was difficult to apply and verify the different configuration changes across the network. Tuning the TCP configurations on the mobile devices themselves was impossible due to a lack of privileges. More fundamentally, features like 0-RTT connections and better RTT estimation are central to protocol design and it is not possible to reap such benefits by simply tuning TCP alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, we assessed a few&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Media_Flow_Protocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;UDP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;-based protocols that have addressed shortcomings for video streaming to see if they might be leveraged for our use case.  However, they lack industry grade security features and typically assume a complementary TCP connection for metadata and control information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the best of our knowledge and based on our research, QUIC was one of very few protocols that addressed the general problem for Internet traffic, taking into account both security and performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC integration on the Uber platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To successfully integrate QUIC and improve app performance in low connectivity networks, we replaced Uber’s legacy networking stack (HTTP/2 over TLS/TCP) with the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;We leveraged the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cronet¹&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;networking library from the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chromium Projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;which implement a version of the QUIC protocol (gQUIC) that was originally designed by Google. The implementation is continuously&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;evolving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to follow the latest IETF specification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We first integrated Cronet into our Android applications to enable QUIC support. The integration was done in a way to ensure zero migration cost for our mobile engineers. Instead of completely replacing our legacy network stack that used the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://square.github.io/okhttp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;OkHttp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;library, we integrated the Cronet library under the OkHttp API framework. By performing the integration in this way, we avoided changes to the API layer of our network calls, which rely on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://square.github.io/retrofit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Retrofit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, we also avoided changing core networking functions that perform such tasks as failover, redirects, and compression. We leveraged the interceptor mechanism of OkHttp to implement middleware to seamlessly intercept HTTP traffic from the application and send the traffic to the Cronet library using Java&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/cronet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We still use the OkHttp library in cases where the Cronet library fails to load for certain Android devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to our Android approach, we integrated Cronet into Uber’s iOS applications by intercepting HTTP traffic from the iOS networking&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlprotocol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NSURLProtocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This abstraction, provided by the iOS Foundation, handles loading protocol-specific URL data and ensures that we can integrate Cronet into our iOS applications without significant migration costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC termination on Google Cloud Load Balancers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the backend, the QUIC termination is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;provided&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;by a Google Cloud Load balancing infrastructure that supports QUIC using the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;alt-svc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;header on responses. Essentially, on every HTTP response, the load balancer adds an alt-svc header that validates QUIC support for that domain. When the Cronet client receives an HTTP response with an alt-svc header, it uses QUIC for the following HTTP requests sent to that domain. Once the load balancer terminates QUIC, our infrastructure transparently forwards it over HTTP2/TCP to our back-end data centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given performance is the primary reason for our exploration of a better transport protocol, we first set up a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/production-engineering/augmented-traffic-control-a-tool-to-simulate-network-conditions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;network emulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;testbed to study how QUIC performs under different network profiles in the lab. To verify QUIC’s performance gains in real networks, we then conducted on-road experiments in New Delhi using emulated traffic that closely replays the highly frequent HTTPS network calls in our rider application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experiment one&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experiment setup, outlined below, consists of the following components:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Android test devices with the OkHttp and Cronet network stack to ensure we can run HTTPS traffic over both TCP and QUIC, respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Java-based emulation server that sends stubbed HTTPS response headers and payloads to the client devices upon receiving HTTPS requests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proxies placed in a cloud region close to India to terminate the TCP and QUIC connections. While we used the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;NGINX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;reverse proxy to terminate TCP, it was challenging to find an openly available reverse proxy for QUIC. We built a QUIC reverse proxy in-house using the core QUIC stack from Chromium and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/4380217c0aa51adff8f624ba412e415e6493413a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;contributed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the proxy back to Chromium as open source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6110&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;153&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9.png 1380w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-300x115.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-768x294.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1024x392.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-696x266.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1068x409.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image9-1098x420.png 1098w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 6 : Our on-road experimental setup to test QUIC versus TCP performance consisted of Android devices running the OkHttp and Cronet stacks, cloud-based proxies to terminate the connections, and an emulation server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results from this experiment showed that QUIC consistently and very significantly outperformed TCP in terms of latency when downloading the HTTPS responses on the devices. Specifically, we witnessed a 50 percent reduction in latencies across the board, from the 50th percentile to 99th percentile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Experiment two&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once Google made QUIC available within&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-quic-support-https-load-balancing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Cloud Load Balancing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we repeated the same experiment setup with one modification: instead of using NGINX, we used the Google Cloud load balancers to terminate the TCP and QUIC connections from the devices and forward the HTTPS traffic to an emulated server. These load balancers are spread across the globe, with the closest PoP server selected based on the geolocation of the device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6106&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5.png 1800w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-300x128.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-768x327.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-1024x436.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-696x297.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-1068x455.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-986x420.png 986w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Figure 8: In our second experimental setup, we wanted to compare the latency of TCP and QUIC terminating at the Google Cloud versus using our own cloud-based proxy.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We encountered a few interesting insights from this second experiment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoP termination improved TCP performance:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Since the Google Cloud load balancers terminate the TCP connection closer to users and are well-tuned for performance, the resulting lower RTTs significantly improved the TCP performance. Although QUIC’s gains were lower, it still out-performed TCP by about a 10-30 percent reduction in tail-end latency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long tail impacted by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cellular/wireless hops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Even though our in-house QUIC proxy  was farther away from the device (approximately 50 milliseconds higher latency) than the Google Cloud load balancers, it offered similar performance gains (a 15 percent reduction as opposed to a 20 percent reduction in the 99th percentile against TCP). These results suggests that the last-mile cellular hop is the main bottleneck in the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6113&quot; src=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;185&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12.png 633w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12-300x185.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image12-356x220.png 356w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Production traffic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Encouraged by previous tests, we proceeded by adding QUIC support into our Android and iOS applications. We performed an A/B test between QUIC and TCP to quantify the impact of QUIC across all cities in which Uber operates. Overall, we saw significant reductions in the tail-end latencies across various dimensions, such as region, carrier, and network type.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 9, below, depicts the percentage improvements in the tail-end latencies (95th and 99th percentile) across different mega-regions and network types (including LTE, 3G, and 2G.):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figure 8. In our production tests, QUIC consistently outperformed TCP in terms of latency over regions and network types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are just getting started: deploying QUIC for mobile applications at our scale has paved the way for several exciting avenues to improve application performance across both high and low connectivity networks, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Increase QUIC coverage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the analysis of the protocol’s actual performance on real traffic, we observed that around 80 percent of sessions successfully used QUIC for all requests, while about 15 percent of them used a mix of TCP and QUIC. Our current hypothesis about this mix is that the Cronet code library switches back to TCP upon timeouts since it cannot distinguish UDP failures and actual poor network conditions. We are currently working to solve this problem as we move forward with leveraging the QUIC protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;QUIC optimization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The traffic from Uber’s mobile applications are typically latency-sensitive as opposed to bandwidth-intensive. Also, our applications are primarily accessed using cellular networks. Based on our experiments, the tail-end latencies are still higher despite using proxies that terminate TCP and QUIC close to the user. Our team is actively working on investigating further improvements to control congestion and improve loss recovery algorithms for QUIC to optimize for latency based on our traffic and user access patterns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With these improvements and others, we plan to  further enhance the user experience on our platform regardless of network or region, making convenient and seamless transportation more accessible across our global markets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<link>https://www.blog.google/products/hardware/glass-enterprise-edition-2/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/products/hardware/glass-enterprise-edition-2/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is built on the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 platform, which features a significantly more powerful multicore CPU (central processing unit) and a new artificial intelligence engine. This enables significant power savings, enhanced performance and support for computer vision and advanced machine learning capabilities. We’ve also partnered with Smith Optics to make Glass-compatible safety frames for different types of demanding work environments, like manufacturing floors and maintenance facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Glass Enterprise Edition 2 features improved camera performance and quality, which builds on Glass’s existing first person video streaming and collaboration features. We’ve also added USB-C port that supports faster charging, and increased overall battery life to enable customers to use Glass longer between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is easier to develop for and deploy. It’s built on Android, making it easier for customers to integrate the services and APIs (application programming interfaces) they already use. And in order to support scaled deployments, Glass Enterprise Edition 2 now supports Android Enterprise Mobile Device Management.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>3D interfaces are usually worse than 2D interfaces</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This was an internal post I made in 2017, and my position has only strengthened in the following years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D interfaces are usually worse than 2D interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I argued that cylindrical panels were surprisingly effective, and we should embrace them for VR Shell UI. There was a lot of push back about giving up the flexibility of putting UI wherever you want in 3D, and curtailing the imagined future world of even more 3D interfaces, but the argument for objectively higher quality with the native TimeWarp layer projection kept it from being a completely abstract design question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing a position description before an interview last week, I saw that one of the responsibilities for the open Product Management Leader position was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Create a new interaction paradigm that is 3D instead of 2D based”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to make the abstract argument against 3D interaction paradigms more strongly now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously when you are dealing with a 3D object, as with Medium, Quill, or a 3D data visualization, then you have a 3D interface, but I contend that the majority of browsing, configuring, and selecting interactions benefit from designing in 2D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting information across multiple depths is harmful, because your eyes need to re-verge (and, we wish, re-focus). This is easy to demonstrate if you have a convenient poster across the room in your visual field above your monitor – switch back and forth between reading your monitor and the poster, then contrast with just switching back and forth with the icon bar at the bottom of your monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be worse in VR, because you have to fight the lack of actual focus change. With varifocal we would be back to just the badness of the real world, but no better. This is fundamental to the way humans work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a related notion that varifocal is a hardware feature necessary for good text readability. This is wrong – it is only important for making text at widely separated distances, like a piece of paper six inches away from your eyes and a billboard, comfortable. Static HMD optics can have their focus point put wherever we want, and we should put it at the UI distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the freedom to place interfaces wherever you want, as we do in VR, you would not place the interfaces at common reading / monitor distances. “Reading glasses” are usually necessary specifically because older people can’t force their eyes to focus so close anymore. The exact relaxed eye distance will vary from person to person, but it is going to be several meters out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an advantage of VR! Focusing on close monitors all day long is a stress on your eyes that can be removed.&lt;br/&gt;If you want to be able to scan information as quickly and comfortably as possible, it should all be the same distance from the viewer and it should not be too close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depth cues give important information when you are making sense of an environment and moving relative to elements of it. If you want to hit something with a spear or time a dodge, it is valuable information. The actions you are doing in a UI almost never benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your view of a 3D environment is a pair of 2D projections. Unless you move significantly relative to the environment, they stay essentially the same 2D projections. Even if you designed a truly 3D UI, you would have to consider this to keep the 3D elements from overlapping each other when projected onto the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think 3D may have a small place in efficient UI design as a “treatment” for UI elements, using slightly protruding 3D buttons sticking out of the UI surface in places where you would otherwise use color changes or faux-3D effects like bevels or drop shadows. Possibly 3D modeled “icons” on the UI layer, but basically staying within a few inches of the UI surface. The visual scanning and interaction is still fundamentally 2D, but it is another channel of information that your eye will naturally pick up on. This isn’t convenient to implement in a VrShell style environment, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that VR interfaces should just be “floating screens” – I really disliked how our first Home design was basically a console UI design floating in the middle of the screen, complete with TV “safe zones” around the entire thing.&lt;br/&gt;The core advantage of VR from a UI standpoint is the ability to use the entire field of view, and allow it to be extended by “glancing” to the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always urge content selection to go off the sides of the screens, and have a size/count that leaves half of a tile visible at each edge when looking straight ahead. If the half-tile is at all interesting, it will draw a glance to bring the rest of it in. Actually interacting with UI elements at the angles well away from the center is not good for the user, because if they haven’t rotated their entire body, it is a stress on their neck to focus there long, so the idea is to glance, then scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other key element that we could take more advantage of is putting less frequently used UI elements off to the sides or back. The void theater button in Netflix or the old “skip new user intro” button that was in Home are good examples of this, and things like options menus could easily be pushed off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to slightly “untrain” users for this, though. Today’s computer UI’s hide options in ways that definitely aren’t intuitive – how was I supposed to know that clicking that obscure icon was going to reveal a whole window of other choices? However, this trains people to look for hidden meanings in UI elements, rather than actually looking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;loop-post-meta loop-post-meta-single&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-share-buttons&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;May 20, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;73&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to announce that Geoff Ralston is taking over for me as President of YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve known Geoff for almost ten years, he’s been a YC partner for eight, and I think he’s one of the most thoughtful, helpful, and kind investors in Silicon Valley. One of my earliest memories of Geoff is him laying on the floor of the first Stripe office helping the founders redline a contract for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoff manages to combine a broad background of knowledge, expansive thinking about the future, and being a coworker that everyone likes in a way that is very rare (usually people have at most two out of the three).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cares a lot about YC and understands what makes it work. I feel a deeply shared vision with him for what YC should be. In my conversations with Geoff about whether or not we should fund a particular company (we often did interviews together), I can’t remember a single major disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took over from PG, one of the things we talked most about was how to make YC last for a very long time. I’ve worked hard to build the organization in that direction, and I feel confident that Geoff is the best choice to really cement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a true pleasure to work with the entire YC partnership–in different ways, every YC partner is immensely talented, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They collectively operate at a scale and level that I don’t think the industry has seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on OpenAI has been more exciting (and more complex) than I ever imagined, and I’m excited to be able to focus on it more fully. And I’m very thankful that YC will be in such good hands with Geoff–I care about YC more than I thought I’d care about any organization. I will, of course, remain an advisor to YC, and will be around to help Geoff as he takes on his new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
