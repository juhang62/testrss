<title>Police fine pedestrian for disorderly behaviour after he tried to cover his face</title>
<link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7036141/Police-fine-pedestrian-90-facial-recognition-camera-row.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7036141/Police-fine-pedestrian-90-facial-recognition-camera-row.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Police fined a pedestrian £90 for disorderly behaviour after he tried to cover his face when he saw a controversial facial recognition camera on a street in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/london/index.html&quot; id=&quot;mol-6c1c2fc0-77c5-11e9-81d3-d7d98b5046db&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Officers set up the camera on a van in Romford, East London, which then cross-checked photos of faces of passers-by against a database of wanted criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But one man was unimpressed about being filmed and covered his face with his hat and jacket, before being stopped by officers who took his picture anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being pulled aside, the man told police: 'If I want to cover me face, I'll cover me face. Don't push me over when I'm walking down the street.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;It comes just weeks after it was claimed the new technology incorrectly identified members of the public in 96 per cent of matches made between 2016 and 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The cameras have been rolled out in a trial in parts of Britain, with the Met making its first arrest last December when shoppers in London's West End were scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But their use has sparked a privacy debate, with civil liberties group Big Brother Watch branding the move a 'breach of fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of assembly'. Police argue they are&lt;span&gt; necessary to crack down on spiralling crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officers previously insisted people could decline to be scanned, before later clarifying that anyone trying to avoid scanners may be stopped and searched.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;It was first deployed by South Wales Police ahead of the Champions League final in Cardiff in 2007, but wrongly matched more than 2,000 people to possible criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Police and security services worldwide are keen to use facial recognition technology to bolster their efforts to fight crime and identify suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But they have been hampered by the unreliability of the software, with some trials failing to correctly identify a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The technology made incorrect matches in every case during two deployments at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford last year, according to Big Brother Watch. It was also reportedly 96 per cent accurate in eight uses by the Met from 2016 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;mol-factbox-title&quot;&gt;Six steps behind facial recognition technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ins cleared mol-factbox-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police uses facial recognition technology called NeoFace, developed by Japanese IT firm NEC, which matches faces up to a so-called watch list of offenders wanted by the police and courts for existing offences. Cameras scan faces in its view measuring the structure of each face, creating a digital version that is searched up against the watch list. If a match is detected, an officer on the scene is alerted, who will be able to see the camera image and the watch list image, before deciding whether to stop the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;In Romford, the man was fined £90 at the scene by officers, who also arrested three other people during the day thanks to the technology, according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;class&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0795c8w&quot;&gt;BBC Click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being stopped he asked an officer: 'How would you like it if you walked down the street and someone grabbed your shoulder? You wouldn't like it, would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The officer told him: 'Calm yourself down or you're going in handcuffs. It's up to you. Wind your neck in.' But the man replied: 'You wind your neck in.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being fined, the man told a reporter: 'The chap told me down the road - he said they've got facial recognition. So I walked past like that (covering my face).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'It's a cold day as well. As soon as I've done that, the police officer's asked me to come to him. So I've got me back up. I said to him 'f*** off', basically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'I said 'I don't want me face shown on anything. If I want to cover me face, I'll cover me face, it's not for them to tell me not to cover me face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'I've got a now £90 fine, here you go, look at that. Thanks lads, £90. Well done.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Silkie Carlo, the director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, was at the scene holding a placard saying 'stop facial recognition' - before she asked an officer about the man they had taken aside: 'What's your suspicion?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The officer replied: 'The fact that he's walked past clearly masking his face from recognition and covered his face. It gives us grounds to stop him and verify.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Ivan Balhatchet, the Metropolitan Police's covert and intelligence lead, said: 'We ought to explore all technology to see how it can make people safer, how it can make policing more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;mol-factbox-title&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: How police are using facial recognition technology in London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ins cleared mol-factbox-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Why are the police using facial recognition technology?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police hopes live facial recognition technology will help reduce crime, especially violent incidents, and could be used as a tactic to deter people from offending. They claim trialling the system in real life conditions will enable them to gather accurate data and learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt; the public being made aware of the trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police said it is making people aware the trial is under way with posters displayed around the affected areas. There will be a 'clear uniformed presence' of the technology, with information leaflets being handed out to members of the public. &lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Are faces stored in a database?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police said it will only keep faces matching the watch list for up to 30 days - all other data is deleted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Can you refuse to be scanned?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;People can refuse to be scanned without being viewed as suspicious, although the Metropolitan Police said 'there must be additional information available to support such a view'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Is this the first facial recognition trial?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police has previously tested the system at major events, first at the Notting Hill Carnival in August 2016 and then at Remembrance Day, as well as at the Stratford transport hub. South Wales Police have also tried the technology at various events including the Champions League 2017 final in Cardiff, rugby matches and Liam Gallagher and Kasabian concerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;How accurate is the technology?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Trials in London and Wales have had mixed results so far. Last May, the Metropolitan Police released figures showing it had identified 102 false positives - cases where someone was incorrectly matched to a photo - with only two correct matches.  South Wales Police said its trial results improved after changes to the algorithm used to identify people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Eight people were arrested during the trial on January 31 this year, which took eight hours, but just three were a direct result of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A 15-year-old boy identified by the recognition cameras was arrested on suspicion of robbery but released with no further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and a 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of breach of a molestation order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The five other arrests were two teenage boys accused of robbery, a 17-year-old boy accused of firing a gun and two men aged 25 and 46 for drug possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Speaking about the man who was fined, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'On Thursday, January 31 officers stopped a man who was seen acting suspiciously in the area of Romford Town Centre during the deployment of the live facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'After being stopped the man became aggressive and made threats towards officers. He was issued with a penalty notice for disorder as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'While anyone who declined to be scanned was not necessarily be viewed as suspicious, officers used their judgement to identify any potential suspicious behaviour.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Last December, a suspect was arrested by the Metropolitan Police during a trial of the facial recognition technology among Christmas shoppers at Leicester Square in London's West End.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Another man was stopped due to the technology, but found not to be the man the computer thought he was - although he was arrested over another offence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Big Brother Watch has previously said the technology is a 'breach of fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of assembly'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;They have monitored the officers and say police treat those who avoid the cameras with suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But the police insist people can decline to be scanned without arousing suspicion and the move is necessary to crack down on spiralling violence crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A mandate they have produced to guide officers states: 'It is right and appropriate to bring people who are unlawfully at large to justice as they may otherwise pose a threat of safety to the public through the commission of crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'It is less resource intensive which will save police time and money and allow police to concentrate resources on other priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Home Office has said the system can be an 'invaluable tool' in fighting crime, while the National Police Chiefs Council said it could disrupt criminals but insisted any rollout must show be effective within 'sufficient safeguards'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Each face has approximately 80 unique nodal points across the eyes, nose, cheeky and mouth which distinguish one person from another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A digital video camera measures the distance between various points on the human face, such as the width of the nose, depth of the eye sockets, distance between the eyes and shape of the jawline.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I turned my interview task for Google into a startup</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://uxdesign.cc/i-turned-my-interview-task-for-google-into-a-startup-877943fb3b34</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1299&quot; id=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Over a year ago I was lucky enough to bag an interview at Google for the role of Visual Designer. After getting through several tough rounds I was faced with the notorious Google interview task. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t get the job. Fortunately for me, all was not lost as I fell in love with the task so much I co-founded a fitness tech startup on the back of that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dbd3&quot; id=&quot;dbd3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the story of how we built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tona, launched today on Product Hunt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*JSRpT9DxetR4V66mVTa4BA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2770&quot; data-height=&quot;1113&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JSRpT9DxetR4V66mVTa4BA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;3f6e&quot; id=&quot;3f6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The dreaded interview task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84a3&quot; id=&quot;84a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The bane of all product designer’s lives is the dreaded interview task. We all know the drill: You have ‘4–6 hours’ to design a slick product, with a memorable brand and cohesive working method. No one acknowledges the fact that in reality, you’re about to dedicate up to 5 working days on this task, with the potential for them to ghost you straight afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a524&quot; id=&quot;a524&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I interviewed at Google for the role of Visual Designer this was no exception. After two rounds of interviews later I was slapped with the infamous task. They presented three design challenge options to pick from, with a weeks notice and advised that we should spend no more that 3–5 hours on the task (wink, wink) and provide the following deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;6f3a&quot; id=&quot;6f3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A low-fidelity overview of your proposed UX (wireframes or sketches are fine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;77dd&quot; id=&quot;77dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A high-fidelity mockup for one widget or interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5941&quot; id=&quot;5941&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Any materials you used to arrive at final results (paper sketches, explorations, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7983&quot; id=&quot;7983&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;To be fair to Google, they did stipulate they valued the work process and idea generation above pixel perfection. But, as a designer, I can’t help but fuss over the details. I know that great visuals capture attention and that every extra minute of work can help you get the edge over a rival candidate. And so, the late night work began…&lt;/p&gt;

God is in the detail (interview task mockups)
&lt;h3 name=&quot;58df&quot; id=&quot;58df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4fc9&quot; id=&quot;4fc9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;One of the options was to design a Fitness Class Leaderboard, as a regular gym goer, I decided to go for it. I figured it was a chance to flex my design skills in UI and UX, with a little fun thrown in. Fit-tech had already piqued my interest, as with my friends (and future co-founders) I had spent many evenings nursing drinks and musing ideas for a gym-class booking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;38b5&quot; id=&quot;38b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In order to cut down the production time, I reused assets I’d already doodled during the class-booking app ideation. Then I duplicated the layout and web page presentation format that I’d used for previous interviews (check out my previous work for &lt;a href=&quot;https://farmer-july-85764.netlify.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://farmer-july-85764.netlify.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewburtondesign.co.uk/work/hudl/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://andrewburtondesign.co.uk/work/hudl/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hudl&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

The holiday balcony workspace. Intentionally ruffled by design…
&lt;p name=&quot;bc6a&quot; id=&quot;bc6a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I always strive to be as efficient as possible by reusing components and assets, but the dreaded interview task still got to me. I racked up 30 hours of work trying to make Google love me. All on a week in which I was also on holiday… in the South of France, I was working until 3am on a balmy balcony in the town of Nice (not the worst thing in the world, but being on the beach or in the buzzing bars would have been a hell of a lot better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84e1&quot; id=&quot;84e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I really wanted the job, I put my all in. You can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;final interview submission here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Interview task on the left and Tona as it is now. Although the brand has visibly improved, the core facets of the product are still very similar
&lt;h3 name=&quot;bc8e&quot; id=&quot;bc8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the interview task to a business idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;772f&quot; id=&quot;772f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Unfortunately for me, I didn’t get the job. I was told it was extremely close and that I should reapply in 12 months, but it seems my ideas weren’t out there enough to excite them… (so try and shock them, aspiring Googlers!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c46&quot; id=&quot;3c46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This pragmatic approach was intentional however, I was already thinking ahead to how this product could sell to my local gym, or how I would use it next time I hit a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LPTprtuf418rdCf0Av3Fgw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2264&quot; data-height=&quot;1155&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LPTprtuf418rdCf0Av3Fgw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3947&quot; id=&quot;3947&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Whilst researching, I found there was no true platform for gym leaderboards. Ones that record and display metrics no-matter your gym. What I had in mind would record everything, from reps to distance, load to calories, seconds to rounds, max heart rates to one rep maxes. In your gym, or at home, and compare your results with friends, gym buddies and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d86&quot; id=&quot;4d86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My mind instantly went to an app I love, Strava. I use it almost daily to record my runs to share and compete with friends. But, I also enjoy strength and HIIT training in the gym. With the gym leaderboard brief, I realised there was an untapped niche to create a social fitness platform for all gym based activity. Recording and sharing reps and sets, not just your distance and pace.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We froze the salaries of 20 executives and improved the lives of 500 employees</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/15/executive-pay-salaries-carecentrix-senior-team-employees</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/15/executive-pay-salaries-carecentrix-senior-team-employees</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, as a newly minted CEO of healthcare services company called CareCentrix, I had a complicated challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;Disney heir on CEO's $66m pay: 'No one on the freaking planet is worth that'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our margins had declined and our revenue growth had stalled. My board of directors and my investors demanded improved performance: lower costs that would lead to more growth and more profit. At the same time, I was becoming increasingly worried about our team and our turnover numbers. We are a people business and in some divisions we were losing 30 to 40% of our teammates within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My HR staff suggested that we re-think our recruiting and training – which made sense – but I thought that we could do more. I thought we needed to reconsider how we supported and paid our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our entry level jobs – where turnover was the highest – we paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour (or less than $16,000 per year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming nothing went wrong, and assuming that our employees were living with another wage earner or working another part-time job, $7.25 hourly wage might be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that for many of us, things do go wrong, and I had emails from my new teammates to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was from a customer service representative – a young mother with a family, who had lost her apartment in a fire and did not have enough money for diapers. Another email soon followed – this employee had missed a few bills and was living out of her car with her child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drove me crazy: how did we get to the point where one of our employees had to apologetically ask for financial support so she and her family could put a roof over their heads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;A young mother did not have enough money for diapers. Another employee was living in her car with her child&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of our elected officials congratulated us for creating jobs, I felt that we were failing some of our employees, and the communities we were based in. The more our executive team parsed through the requests for assistance, the more we all became uncomfortable with the mismatch between what we asked of our employees and what we provided to them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost no one enters the infuriatingly complicated healthcare system by choice. It might be from an accident or a chronic illness, but nearly every person who needs healthcare starts from a position of vulnerability and some fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we hire new employees, we ask that they inject their heart in every interaction – beyond just completing a task – because although it is what every patients deserves it’s not always what they receive from the system. How could we demand that our employees focus on the unmet needs of our patients, while their employer was not looking out for their basic needs ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my concerns to my team. After many tough conversations, it became clear that we could not simply raise wages and hit our budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back with a challenge: what if we froze the wages of the senior team and invested the annual inflation adjustment allotted for us into raising the wages of our entry-level employees ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenged the chief financial officer to see how deeply we would have to freeze wages in order to reach our goal of a base rate of $15 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was that we did not have to go very deep. Over the last few decades executive salaries have skyrocketed. That translates into accelerated wage growth in the highest tiers of executives throughout American business, and it affects every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that meant for our company was that if we just froze the wages of our most senior team – less than 20 executives – we could radically increase the wages and improve the lives of nearly 500 of our teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with our executives was straightforward. We were in the midst of a turnaround. We were demanding much from every corner of the company. Small financial sacrifices from those at the top could be life changing for those at the bottom of our wage scale. We needed to do it to build a real sense of Team CareCentrix. They agreed. With joy, we announced in January 2015 that our minimum base pay for employees would go up to $34,000, or the equivalent of $15 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising wages in the midst of a business turnaround was not easy. We needed our executive team to buy into a vision of business success where every employee had a fair shot at success. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our business has tripled over the past five years. Our minimum wage is now approaching $16.50 per hour and last year we broadened profit sharing to all levels of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share my story at CareCentrix so that politicians and the public remember the role and responsibility of the business community in contributing to the success of the American Dream, and so that business leaders understand that an investment in the workforce is one of the best financial decisions to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has its unique challenge, but the example of CareCentrix suggests that there is plenty wealth to go around – at the very least, to make sure that the employees we ask so much of can live a healthy and fulfilling life with the wages we pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to serving as CEO of CareCentrix, John Driscoll is a member of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high-net worth business leaders and investors who are united in their concern about the destabilizing concentration of wealth and power in America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Close to 735k Fraudulently Obtained IP Addresses Uncovered and Revoked</title>
<link>http://www.circleid.com/posts/20190514_735k_fraudulently_obtained_ip_addresses_have_been_revoked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.circleid.com/posts/20190514_735k_fraudulently_obtained_ip_addresses_have_been_revoked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/11888.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/11888.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Registry for Internet Numbers, Ltd. (ARIN) has won a legal case&lt;/strong&gt; against an elaborate multi-year scheme to defraud the Internet community of approximately 735,000 IPv4 addresses, the organization has revealed. While the specifics of the findings are not released, John Curran, ARIN President and CEO said the fraud was detected as a result of an internal due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARIN is a nonprofit member-based organization responsible for distributing Internet number resources in the US, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean. The emerging IPv4 address transfer market and increasing demand have resulted in more attempts to obtain IPv4 addresses fraudulently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;This is the first arbitration ever&lt;/strong&gt; brought under an ARIN Registration Services Agreement, and related proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. ARIN was able to prove an intricate scheme to fraudulently obtained resources that included many falsely notarized officer attestations sent to ARIN. &quot;A company in South Carolina obtained and utilized 11 shelf companies across the United States, and intentionally created false aliases purporting to be officers of those companies, to induce ARIN into issuing the fraudulently sought IPv4 resources and approving related transfers and reassignments of these addresses. The defrauding party was monetizing the assets obtained in the transfer market, and obtained resources under ARIN's waiting list process.&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamarin.net/2019/05/13/taking-a-hard-line-on-fraud/&quot;&gt;ARIN Press Release&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;The defrauding entity adopted an aggressive posture&lt;/strong&gt; after ARIN requested that it produce certain documents and explain its conduct. The suspected party filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction against ARIN in U.S. District Court, and demanded a hearing the following morning (the Friday just before Christmas). &quot;The aggressive posture was taken after ARIN indicated its intent to revoke addresses, while permitting defrauding entity to renumber to allow existing bona fide customers not to have service interrupted,&quot; ARIN’s General Counsel told CircleID. &quot;The litigation was filed against ARIN to seek an injunction to stop ARIN from revoking and enter arbitration. Some addresses were transferred for money prior to that demand, others were pending transfer and were never transferred due to ARIN investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Some fraudulently obtained addresses were transferred to third parties;&lt;/strong&gt; however ARIN made no effort to pursue the parties that received the completed transfer, ARIN’s General Counsel told CircleID. The reason being: &quot;(a) addressed were in another RIR service region (e.g. RIPE NCC and APNIC) and (b) ARIN did not see any evidence they knew of or participated in the fraud. In other words, they appeared to be bona fide 3rd parties.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;ARIN obtained the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arin.net/vault/about_us/corp_docs/20190506_arbitration_award_and_order.pdf&quot;&gt;arbitration award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on May 1, 2019, which included revocation of all resources issued pursuant to fraud and $350,000 to ARIN for its legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE May 15, 2019:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Charleston Man and Business Indicted in Federal Court in Over $9M Fraud&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; – United States Department of Justice issues a statement annoucing Amir Golestan, 36, of Charleston, and Micfo, LLC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/pdf/golstan_indict_filed_20190515.pdf&quot;&gt;were charged in federal court&lt;/a&gt; in a twenty-count indictment. The indictment charges twenty counts of wire fraud, with each count punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21.912698412698&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The indictment alleges that since February 2014, Golestan and Micfo created and utilized 'Channel Partners,' which purported to consist of several individual businesses, all of whom acquired the right to IP addresses from the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN). The indictment alleges that Golestan and Micfo fabricated the true nature of the Channel Partners, including creating false officers and deceptive websites for the businesses, which were in turn used to deceive ARIN and to fraudulently obtain IP address rights from ARIN. The indictment charges that, through this scheme, Golestan and Micfo obtained the rights to approximately 757,760 IP addresses, with a market value between $9,850,880.00 and $14,397,440.00.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/charleston-man-and-business-indicted-federal-court-over-9m-fraud&quot;&gt;DOJ&lt;/a&gt; / May 15, 2019)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Falsehoods programmers believe about Unix time</title>
<link>https://alexwlchan.net/2019/05/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-unix-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alexwlchan.net/2019/05/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-unix-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With apologies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/&quot;&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dannybirchall&quot;&gt;Danny&lt;/a&gt; was asking us about our favourite facts about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time&quot;&gt;Unix time&lt;/a&gt; in the Wellcome Slack yesterday, and I was reminded of the way that it behaves in some completely counter-intuitive ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three facts all seem eminently sensible and reasonable, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unix time is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I wait exactly one second, Unix time advances by exactly one second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix time can never go backwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;False, false, false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s unsatisfying to say “this is false” without explaining &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, so I’ll explain that below. If you’d like to think about it first and make your own guess, don’t scroll past the picture of the clock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://alexwlchan.net/images/2019/L0072180.jpg&quot;/&gt; A bracket clock. Construction and assembly by John Leroux. Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellcomecollection.org/works/t8v9t648&quot;&gt;Wellcome Collection&lt;/a&gt;. Used under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;All three of these falsehoods have the same underlying cause: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second&quot;&gt;leap seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re unfamiliar with leap seconds, here’s a brief primer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two factors that make up UTC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.7771428571429&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.6861924686192&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time&quot;&gt;International Atomic Time&lt;/a&gt;, which is an average of hundreds of atomic clocks spread around the globe. We can measure a second from the electromagnetic properties of an atom, and it’s the most accurate measurement of time known to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.87272727272727&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time&quot;&gt;Universal Time&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the Earth’s rotation about its own axis. One complete rotation is one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem is, these two numbers don’t always match. The Earth’s rotation isn’t consistent – it’s gradually slowing down, so days in Universal Time are getting longer. Atomic clocks, on the other hand, are fiendishly accurate, and consistent for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the two times drift apart, a leap second is added or removed to UTC to bring them back together. Since 1972, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service&quot;&gt;the IERS&lt;/a&gt; (who manage this stuff) have inserted an extra 27 leap seconds. The result is a UTC day with 86,401 seconds (one extra), or 86,399 (one missing) – both of which mess with a fundamental assumption of Unix time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix time assumes that each day is exactly 86,400 seconds long (60 × 60 × 24 = 86,400), leap seconds be damned. If there’s a leap second in a day, Unix time either repeats or omits a second as appropriate to make them match. As of 2019, the extra 27 leap seconds are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so our falsehoods go as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix time is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC, &lt;em&gt;minus leap seconds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wait exactly one second, Unix time advances by exactly one second, &lt;em&gt;unless a leap second has been removed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there’s never been a leap second removed in practice (and the Earth’s slowing rotation means it’s unlikely), but if it ever happened, it would mean the UTC day is one second shorter. The last UTC second (23:59:59) is dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Unix day has the same number of seconds, so when the next day starts, it skips ahead by one. The final Unix second of the shorter day never gets allocated to a UTC timestamp. Here’s what that would look like, in quarter-second increments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alexwlchan.net/images/2019/unix_time_skips_forwards.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start at 23:59:58:00 UTC and wait one second, the Unix time advances by &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; seconds, and the Unix timestamp 101 never gets assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix time can never go backwards, &lt;em&gt;unless a leap second has been added&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one has happened in practice – 27 times at time of writing. The UTC day gets an extra second added to the end, 23:59:60. Each Unix day has the same number of seconds, so it can’t just add an extra second – instead, it repeats the Unix timestamps for the last second of the day. Here’s what that would look like, in quarter-second increments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alexwlchan.net/images/2019/unix_time_goes_backwards.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start at 23:59:60.50 and wait half a second, the Unix time goes &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; by half a second, and the Unix timestamp 101 matches two UTC seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these probably aren’t even the only weirdnesses of Unix time – they’re just the ones I half-remembered yesterday, enough to check a few details and write a blog post about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is &lt;em&gt;straaaaaange&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Charged $18k for a Static HTML Page</title>
<link>https://idiallo.com/blog/18000-dollars-static-web-page</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://idiallo.com/blog/18000-dollars-static-web-page</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I made a living working as a contractor where I would hop from project to project. Some were short term where I would work for a week and quickly deliver my service. Others lasted a couple months where I would make enough money to take some time off. I preferred the short ones because they allowed me to charge a much higher rate for a quick job. Not only I felt like my own boss, but I also felt like I didn't have to work too hard to make a decent living. My highest rates were still reasonable, and I always delivered high quality service. That was until I landed a gig with a large company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company contacted me in urgency and the manager told me they needed someone right away. Someone who required &lt;strong&gt;minimum training for maximum performance&lt;/strong&gt;. For better or worse, that was my motto. This project was exactly the type of work I liked. It was short, fast, and it paid well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After negotiating a decent rate, I received an email with the instructions. They gave me more context for the urgency. Their developer left without prior warning and never updated anyone on the status of his project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need your full undivided attention to complete this project. For the duration of the contract, you will work exclusively with us to deliver result in a timely manner. We plan to compensate you for the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions were simple: Read the requirements then come up with an estimate of how long it would take to complete the project. This was one of the easier projects I have encountered in my career. It was an HTML page with some minor animations and a few embedded videos. I spent the evening studying the requirements and simulating the implementation in my head. Over the years, I've learned not to write any code for a client until I have a guarantee of pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I determined that this project would be a day's worth of work. But to be cautious, I quoted 20 hours with a rough total of $1500. It was a single HTML page after all, and I can only charge them so much. They asked me to come on site to their satellite office 25 miles away. I would have to drive there for the 3 days I would be working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I arrived at the satellite office. It was in a shopping center where a secret door led to a secret world where a few workers where churning quietly in their cubicles. The receptionist presented me with a brand new MacBook Pro that I had to set up from scratch. I do prefer using a company's laptop because they often require contractors to install suspicious software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the day downloading my toolkit, setting up email, ssh keys, and requesting invites to services. In other words, I got nothing done. This is why I quoted 20 hours, I lost 8 hours of my estimated time doing busy work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I was ready to get down to business. Armed with the MacBook Pro, I sent an email to the manager. I told him that I was ready to work and that I was waiting for the aforementioned assets. That day, I stayed in my cubicle under a softly buzzing light, twiddling my fingers until the sun went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the math again. According to my estimate, I had 4 hours left to do the job, which was not so unrealistic for a single HTML page. But needless to say, the next day, I spent those remaining 4 hours in a company sponsored lunch where I ate very well and mingled with other employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time expired, I made sure to send the manager another email, to let him know that I had been present in the company only I had not received the assets I needed to do the job. That email, of course, was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Monday, I hesitantly drove the 25 miles. To my surprise, the manager had come down to the satellite office where he enthusiastically greeted me. He was a nice easy-going guy in his mid thirties. I was confused. He didn't have the urgency tone he had on the phone when he hired me. We had a friendly conversation where no work was mentioned. Later, we went down to lunch where he paid for my meal. It was a good day. No work was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me a creature of habit, but if you feed me and pamper me everyday, I get used to it. It turned into a routine. I'd come to work, spend some time online reading and watching videos. I'd send one email a day, so they know I am around. Then I'd go get lunch and hangout with whomever had an interesting story to share. At the end of the day, I'd stand up, stretch, let out a well deserved yawn, then drive home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got used to it. In fact, I was expecting it. It was a little disappointing when I finally got an email with a link that pointed to the assets I needed for the job. I came back down to earth, and put on my working face. Only, after spending a few minutes looking through the zip file, I noticed that it was missing the bulk of what I needed. The designer had sent me some Adobe Illustrator files, and I couldn't open it on the MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied to the email explaining my concerns and bundled a few other questions to save time. At that point, my quoted 20 hours time had long expired. I wanted to get this job over with already. Shortly after I clicked on send, I received an email. All it said was: &quot;Adding Alex to the thread,&quot; and Alex was CC'd to the email. Then Alex replied where he added Steve to the thread. Steve replied saying that Michelle was a designer and she would know more about this. Michelle auto responded saying that she was on vacation and that all inquiries should be directed to her manager. Her manager replied asking &quot;Who is Ibrahim?&quot; My manager replied excusing himself for not introducing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a contractor, I am usually in and out of a company before people notice that I work there. Here, I received a flood of emails welcoming me aboard. The chain of emails continued for a while and I was forced to answer to those awfully nice messages. Some people were eager to meet me in person. They got a little disappointed when I said that I was all the way down in California. And jealous, they said they were jealous of the beautiful weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used courtesy to ignore my emails. They used CC to deflect my questions. They used spam to dismiss anything I asked. I spent my days like an archaeologist digging through the deep trenches of emails, hoping to find answers to my questions. You can imagine the level of impostor syndrome I felt every time I remembered that my only task was to build a single static HTML page. The overestimated 20 hours project turned into a 7 weeks adventure where I enjoyed free lunches, drove 50 miles everyday, and dug through emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally completed the project, I sent it to the team on github. All great adventures must come to an end. But shortly after, I received an invitation to have my code reviewed by the whole team on Google Hangout. I had spent more than a month building a single static HTML page and now the entire team would have to critique my work? In my defense, there was also some JavaScript interactions, and it was responsive, and it also had CSS animations... Impostor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the video meeting was rescheduled a few times. When it finally happened, my work and I were not the subject of the meeting. They were all sitting in the same room somewhere in New York and talked for a while like a tight knit group. In fact, all they ever said about the project was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 1:&lt;/em&gt; Hey is anyone working on that sponsored page?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 2:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, I think it's done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person 1:&lt;/em&gt; Great, I'll merge it tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went home that night, I realized that I was facing another challenge. I had been working at this company for 7 weeks, and my original quote was for $1,500. That's roughly the equivalent of $11,100 a year or $214 a week. Or even better, it was $5.35 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This barely covered my transportation. So, I sent them an invoice where I quoted them for 7 weeks of work at the original hourly rate. The total amounted to $18,000. I was ashamed of course, but what else was I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like I expected, I got no reply. If there is something that all large companies have in common, it's that they are not very eager to pay their bills on time. I felt like a cheat charging so much for such a simple job, but this was not a charity. I had been driving 50 miles everyday to do the job, if the job was not getting done it was not for my lack of trying. It was for their slow responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an answer the following week. It was a cold email from the manager where he broke down every day I worked into hourly blocks. Then he highlighted those I worked on and marked a one hour lunch break each day. At the end he made some calculations with our agreed upon hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I was wrong. I had miscalculated the total. After adjustment, the total amount they owed me was $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please confirm the readjusted hours so accounting can write you a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly confirmed these hours.&lt;/p&gt;
