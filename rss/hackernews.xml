<title>European Union Calls for Five Year Strict Ban on Facial Recognition Technology</title>
<link>https://techgrabyte.com/european-union-five-year-ban-facial-recognition/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techgrabyte.com/european-union-five-year-ban-facial-recognition/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With the enormous exposure to the internet and technology, privacy has become a major concern. Once you are on the internet, you start to get traced whether its for customer profiling or for showing targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now because of technologies like facial recognization especially its application in public areas, privacy has become a more sensitive issue, you may turn off your internet but you can’t easily leave your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-2292966296575000&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6598768027&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a May 2018 report, alone FBI has access to 412 million facial images for searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address this issue, as per a leaked &lt;span class=&quot;jsx-2473920458 storyLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AI-white-paper-CLEAN.pdf&quot;&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; draft of the European Commission (an institution of the European Union) on Artificial Intelligence obtained by Euractiv, the European Union is considering a temporary ban on the use of facial recognition technology with exceptions for research and security projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-2292966296575000&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2307596198&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-full-width-responsive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary ban of facial recognition technology will be considered in public places such as train stations, sports stadiums, and shopping centers over fears about the creeping surveillance of European citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the draft, the prohibition of facial recognition technology will last for between 3 and 5 years. In this timestamp, regulators need to figure out how to prevent facial recognition from being abused by both governments and businesses and estimate the impacts of it and possible risk management measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-2292966296575000&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2307596198&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot; data-full-width-responsive=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper stated, “the use of facial recognition technology by private or public actors in public spaces would be prohibited for a definite period (eg 3 to 5 years) during which a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white paper also features five regulatory options for AI across the EU which include voluntary labeling, sectorial requirements for public administration and facial recognition, mandatory risk-based requirements for high-risk applications, safety and liability, and governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission says its preference for regulating AI are regulatory options 3 combined with 4 and 5,  i.e mandatory risk-based requirements on developers that could result in some mandatory criteria, combined with relevant tweaks to existing product safety &amp;amp; liability legislation, &amp;amp; an overarching governance framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, a new regulatory framework for artificial intelligence could include a time-limited ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facial recognition has a high potential for misuse which is why the European Commission’s plan to impose a temporary ban while it weighs all the options makes a great deal of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft document points to the right under the general data protection regulation for EU citizens not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-2292966296575000&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6598768027&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per a spokesman: “To maximize the benefits and address the challenges of artificial intelligence, Europe has to act as one and will define its own way, a human way. Technology has to serve a purpose and the people. Trust and security of EU citizens will, therefore, be at the center of the EU’s strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data is the indispensable raw ingredient of AI. We thus have to unlock, exploit and make flow data generated and owned in Europe, to create wealth for our societies and opportunities for our businesses. Our industry is a world leader in most innovative sectors. Europe has everything it needs to be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final version of the paper is due to be published by the end of February as part of a wider overhaul of the regulation of artificial intelligence. However, the report adds that if the plans are implemented, several current AI projects proposed by European Union countries could be thrown off course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include the German government is planning to roll out facial recognition technology in 134 railway stations and 14 airports after a successful trial in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France is set to become the first EU country to allow its citizens to access secure government websites by such software. In July, the French parliament recommended a new regulatory framework to allow experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals come amid calls from politicians and campaigners in the UK to stop the police using live facial recognition for public surveillance. Most recently the Kings Cross estate found itself at the center of controversy when it was revealed its owners were using facial recognition without telling the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigners claim the current technology is inaccurate, intrusive and infringes on an individual’s right to privacy. A recent study suggested facial recognition algorithms are far less accurate at identifying black and Asian faces compared with white faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This would safeguard the rights of individuals, in particular against any possible abuse of the technology,” the Commission writes, adding that: “It would be necessary to foresee some exceptions, notably for activities in the context of research and development and for security purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation is extremely unclear in the area of law enforcement, and particularly the use of public-private partnerships in law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would argue the GDPR in practice forbids facial recognition by private companies in a surveillance context without member states actively legislating an exemption into the law using their powers to derogate. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, the merchants of doubt at facial recognition firms wish to sow heavy uncertainty into that area of law to legitimize their businesses,” said Dr. Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My fridge has an RFID chip in the water filter</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like when I buy a fridge, I'm buying a fridge. I should be able to replace parts, especially parts designed to be replaced, with generic, less expensive options.

The fact that GE makes their water filters proprietary just seems... I don't know... predatory?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ADHD, a Lifelong Struggle (2018)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;ADHD | Gekk&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;article.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Average|Open%20Sans&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;ADHD - A Lifelong Struggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;I fight a disease every day that is considered a joke by society&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:image&quot; content=&quot;https://gekk.info/articles/images/reminder.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;999.0414241698&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Lifelong Struggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updated several times since early 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm 28 years old (as of this writing in early 2018) and I have ADHD. I am done being embarrassed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD has been painted from hell to breakfast as a joke, a sham, and a thing spineless coddling parents use to excuse their children doing nothing all day. It is as invisible and as insidious as depression but nobody talks about it seriously. I don't know that anyone has taken their life over ADHD before, and that's fortunate perhaps, because as much as people disrespect and ignore depression, ADHD is just as harmful. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone scoffs at it, even your friends who believe it's real. Most people don't even believe that. They may believe it's a diagnosable illness, but they think it's a minor inconvenience. Blaming anything on ADHD feels like a lie, a cheat, an excuse, because that's how it's received. ADHD is real, and after decades of mistreatment sufferers deserve more respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preface: Bullshit Doctors Tell You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to begin by telling you what &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; disqualify you from an ADHD diagnosis. These are actual quotes from followers on Twitter, some of which I know personally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I tentatively brought up the idea of ADHD to my psych who's treating me for other stuff and he said since I can read books it's not likely.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You're an engineer, that's not a field that people with ADHD have any success like you in.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;yeah my doctor said because I didn't doze off in classes I liked I didn't have it&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;criminally&lt;/em&gt; incorrect diagnostic procedure. These are not valid. If your psychiatrist or doctor tells you this, find a new one. Now read on to learn what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What It's Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that for most of human history ADHD was called laziness. I'm lazy as hell. What do I mean? I mean someone can ask me to do a simple task and instead I'll stare into space for three hours. As in, &lt;em&gt;&quot;that boy has been sittin on that fence for two hours, if he'd just washed the damn thing he'd have been done an hour ago,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; kind of lazy. That's because my brain won't let me focus on things I don't want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm not interested in doing something, I can't process any thoughts about how to do it. No, I don't mean it's not fun, I mean &lt;em&gt;my brain will not do it.&lt;/em&gt; If I don't want to wash a fence, I can't think about how to wash the fence. I go into complete lockup. I ask the question, &quot;how do I wash the fence?&quot; and the answer will not come to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't get to &quot;first I need a bucket and water.&quot; That thought will not enter my head, or if it can, it slips away from me. It pops in and out, getting forced aside by other thoughts about the things I want to be doing or thinking about. It feels like the idea is covered in oil and I keep trying to pick it up and it keeps slipping away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In school I heard this refrain a dozen times a year: &quot;once you get going you do great work! you're just impossible to get going.&quot; This was the story of my entire childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would sit down with math homework and look at the page and tell myself, &quot;the problem says 30 &amp;amp;div; 5. What's step one?&quot; and nothing would come to me. I'd stare at the numbers on the page, trying to think of what to do first. I write them down with the long division symbol, right? And then... and it wouldn't go anywhere because my head was filled with thoughts. Not thoughts I wanted. Thoughts I couldn't stop. About things I didn't want to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts about the feeling of the asphalt I laid on during recess at school, because my brain was so active that I couldn't get interested in anything going on on the playground. I just laid on the ground or on a bench and my imagination raced for an hour before we went back to class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagined interactions I imagined having with people I was intrigued by or disliked at school or in my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantasies about things I would do with my life or things I could have done in situations but didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff would just circulate in my head, neverending. On bad days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On good days I was unstoppable. I'd sit down and slam through an entire page of work in minutes, much faster than I should have been able to. I was a voracious reader and could devour any age appropriate book in twenty minutes. I did everything quicker and better than my peers when my mind was engaged. But that always, always, always meant I was enjoying it. I had to want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good days, with math for instance, came when I actually got interested in the work. When I figured out some trick for math or was interested in the history I was supposed to be reading about, I got engaged so hard I was disappointed when I ran out of material. The problem is I had no control over this at all. If my brain decided not to engage, I had no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 18 years later, I've been employed for a decade, and it's still going on. I'm an incredibly inconsistent worker. I've been in trouble off and on the entire time I've been working because when I can get engaged with the work I tear through it at a fantastic clip, but as soon as I tune out, I'm out, and that's it. Damn near nothing can motivate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's not a question of motivation, but ability to concentrate. If someone comes to me and says &quot;I need to turn this excel spreadsheet 90°, can you figure that out?&quot; I can tear into it because that's an interesting problem. If they bring me something dead boring, I can tell myself, &quot;Okay, we're gonna &lt;em&gt;do this thing&lt;/em&gt;&quot; as much as I want but it's going to be a slog, just a god damned slog to get myself to even pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the truth. This is what ADHD is. And NOBODY wants to respect it because it sounds so privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't it? Doesn't it sound &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; convenient, to get to just say, &quot;Oh, no, I won't do that because it's not any fun. Go away. I have ADHD, you can't get mad at me&quot;? Sounds like a hell of a life! Haha no. That's &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why It Sucks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, ADHD is obsessive, and we don't get to choose what we're obsessed with. It's not a conscious decision and it's not based on our personality. It's &lt;em&gt;whatever our brains want right this second&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that tired old joke: &quot;wanna hear a joke about ADHD? a guy w-- hey, a squirrel!&quot; I hate to tell you this, but it's true. I hate it, but it's almost completely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;anterograde amnesia&quot;-style reaction is a little overblown. But that's part of what's so frustrating about it. I can be in the middle of a sentence, a &lt;em&gt;really important&lt;/em&gt; one even, and if something catches my eye I can completely forget what I was saying. I'll know I forgot it, but I can't get it back. And yes, I know, this happens to everyone, but imagine if it happened every single time you tried to talk at all. And this usually happens in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can be midsentence and stop to say &quot;hand me that pen&quot; and my last idea is gone because my brain is now thinking about pens. If you think this is fun or funny, you have never experienced it. It's a fucking nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how stunted my capabilities are because of this? Do you understand how INFURIATING it is that I don't get to choose my interests, they choose me? I have very little say in my hobbies. I can put myself in front of things but if my brain doesn't latch on, I just don't get to do those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked to countless people with ADHD. Everyone says they were described as children the same way: &quot;Smart, but lazy.&quot; That's me. My house is full of projects I can't complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started building a network analyzer out of a Raspberry Pi a while back. I worked on it solid for two days and got a really neat menu system built. I was working out the logic for how to proceed in my head, took a break, and the interest dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two days, every time I wasn't working on that project, I was thinking about that project. It dominated my thoughts, I was constantly imagining new solutions and ways to do things I wouldn't be doing for weeks if I had been able to proceed. And then the thoughts just stopped. And then they wouldn't come anymore. I sat down at that thing four or five times, and each time all I could do was put my hands on it and stare at the screen. When I tried to think about it, when I tried to say &lt;em&gt;what comes next&lt;/em&gt;, I couldn't do it. I couldn't even form the image of the project in my head anymore. I could get a vague sensation of it, and then it was gone, replaced by whatever took over my thoughts. And then I acknowledged what had happened, put it in a box, and that was eight months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I can't program. Why I can't draw. Why I can't perform music. Why I can't sew. Why I haven't written a book and why I didn't start putting stuff on my website until this year. More on that later. The number of things I have wanted &lt;em&gt;desperately&lt;/em&gt; in my life, acquired the resources for, and just been completely unable to concentrate on, is so immense it's heartbreaking to even try to list it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't do everyday things because I can't remember them. I can't responsibly own pets, for instance, because I can't remember to feed them. It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up in the morning and the cat meows at me. I think, &quot;I need to feed him.&quot; But I need to go to the bathroom first, so I do, and then I go downstairs because I forgot about the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later the cat comes down and meows at me. I think, &quot;Oh, I need to feed him. I'll finish typing this message and go do that.&quot; I keep typing for two hours because I forgot about the cat after five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another half an hour later, the cat comes down and meows at me. I think, &quot;Oh, shit, I forgot! I'll do it right now!&quot; I stand up, pick up the dirty glass that's on my desk to bring up to the kitchen, and go upstairs. When I get there I put the glass in the sink, then go back downstairs. Because I forgot about the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else do I have trouble with? Everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gone four days forgetting to shave because every time I thought about it I wasn't immediately next to the bathroom and ready &lt;em&gt;right that second&lt;/em&gt; to go do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't shop without a shopping list or I'll forget, almost consistently, all the most important things I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I have a shopping list, I will consistently forget to look at it. My brain will decide that I've memorized what's on the list and when I say to myself, &quot;I should look at the list&quot; I will, involuntarily, feel myself lose the conviction to do that. The psychological term for this is &quot;executive dysfunction,&quot; I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminders don't help. I tune them out. If I put a post-it on the fridge, my brain just filters it into background static instantly. I've had post-its on my computer monitor at work for literally a year telling me to do things I actually do need to do, and if I try to read them I can't focus on the letters. My eyes bring them into focus, but when I try to understand the words, they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they're blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timers and reminders on my phone don't work. They go off, I mute them or put my phone back in my pocket, and by the time my hand is back at my side I've forgotten what I was supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nobody Believes Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things I want to say is this: If you have ADHD, or think you might, it is not petty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fucking 90s. Scoffing GenXers and Boomers rolled their eyes and said it was all made up. They said we were whiny. They called us everything they call millenials now except they didn't have the word yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is debilitating. It is not a &quot;kid disease&quot; and it doesn't make it &quot;harder&quot; to do things. &lt;strong&gt;It is a fundamental difference in the way brains work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD means you don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; the ability to &quot;buckle down&quot; and &quot;just get to it,&quot; or if you can, it requires MUCH more effort. WAY more effort than for someone without this condition. ADHD means you can't begin a task until you trick your brain into wanting to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ADHD, everything you've ever accomplished was done this way even if you don't realize it. How functional you are with ADHD depends on its severity but also on whether you learned, by chance, how to trick yourself. Some people pick it up on their own but others need help. If they don't get it, they just get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A SERIOUS ILLNESS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like having depression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like having diabetes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not lazy.&lt;br /&gt;You are not stupid.&lt;br /&gt;You are not incompetent.&lt;br /&gt;You are laboring under a terrible restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting right now, you need to accept this. You need to look at yourself in the mirror and see someone who is fighting a disease, not an apathetic loser, not a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a sickness. It is a mental illness and it handicaps our brains so that they aren't ours anymore. They are their own free agents and our personalities are drug along for the ride as they free-associate from one interest to the next. We are unwell and we deserve sympathy, not judgment and mockery, but instead we get treated like stubborn children and scoffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change this. You can turn to someone who's rolling their eyes at you and put venom in your voice and say &quot;Do you understand what this is like?&quot; You can &lt;em&gt;make them feel bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it, but you have to CONVINCE YOURSELF that you are sick. And then you have to tell yourself, &quot;They just mocked my cancer.&quot; Convince yourself that &quot;haha guess you got distracted by a squirrel&quot; is the same as saying &quot;oops, don't give a cookie to Sarah, she'll die.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get mad. You can put acid in your voice and rage in your eyes and &quot;fucking try me, buddy&quot; in your body language, and you can make them walk away hanging their heads in shame. I have done this, in real life. And when you do, you will respect yourself more and punish yourself less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we all punish ourselves. That's the real tragedy of this illness. We are our biggest detractors because we &lt;em&gt;know what we're capable of.&lt;/em&gt; Better than our teachers. Better than our parents. They always said that they could &quot;see our potential,&quot; but we saw &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; times what they did. Every day. We saw the things we could do, in our heads, and hated ourselves for not doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teachers knew I could write a novel in fourth grade. I knew I could write the Wheel of Time if I could just CARE ENOUGH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I got complimented on something I accomplished, I saw in my head what I wanted to do, what I intended to do. Yeah, I wrote 20 pages, but I envisioned 30. 20 is what I got out in thirty minutes after staring at the wall all night and then finally getting scared enough of getting in trouble that buckling down became possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My head is full of ideas, all day. I want to create, I want to accomplish. But everything creates a blast of static in my head that I can't penetrate. If I try to think about anything I either can't at all because I just slide off of it and onto whatever my brain wants to think about, or as soon as the idea enters my head I'm assaulted by a cacophony of related ideas. I can't think about step 1 because my brain is already thinking about steps 6 and 7 and worrying about things that aren't yet relevant so I can't even take the initial steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for the things that I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do, getting started is hard. Suppose I'm at work and I think, &quot;I need to send an email to &amp;lt;people&amp;gt; about &amp;lt;issue&amp;gt;.&quot; Before I can do anything, I'm already thinking about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to write the email, but as I'm writing it, questions fill my head. I try to push them aside and just concentrate on the initial task, &lt;em&gt;send a simple email&lt;/em&gt;, but the questions keep hounding me. I have to stop and get answers to them or I can't think about the email. And if I can't get answers, I'm stuck. I just can't proceed. I end up staring at the empty compose window for ten minutes, writing the first sentence over and over, because my mind is so far out of the game I can't even do basic grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only do tasks in one big shot. If I know I'm going to have to stop, if I know I'm going to be interrupted by some other dependency, I can't even get started. And most of the time, that dependency can't be satisfied &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; I take the first steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even worse situation is when there are multiple questions feeding into each other, questions that affect other questions. I end up in total paralysis, deadlocked by competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work at a VoIP phone company. I think, &quot;I need to configure this phone and get a power supply for it.&quot; This turns into hours and hours of... indecision, almost, but not quite, because I can make decisions but they &lt;em&gt;don't work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can put my foot down and say, &quot;The config comes first,&quot; but before I even get a dialog open on my workstation I'm thinking about the power supply. DO I have one? Do I need to borrow one? What if whoever has one leaves before I can talk to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I decide, I'll go get it. Before I can even take my first step, the complexity of the config process comes back to me, and I think &lt;em&gt;shit, I need to do that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have ADHD as bad as I do, you may think what I'm about to say is a lie. I need you to understand that this is 100% sincere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will actually end up standing at my desk, jerking in one direction or another as the impulses fight each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the email I'm trying to respond to. I think about both the tasks I have to do. My head hurts and there's something else I was working on, so I go look at that. 15 minutes pass, and suddenly I remember that I need to go get the power supply. I start to take a step, and then my body slams to a halt as I remember I need to make the config. I turn back to my desk, and then the thought comes to mind that I need to get the PSU before it's too late. This can go on indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is not a consistent motivator, but it looks like it at times. It works often enough to fool everyone, which makes things worse in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes fear of punishment, of lost opportunities, etc. seems to punch through the haze and help you focus. At least enough to do the minimum. But your bosses (and parents and teachers and roommates and) look at this and say &quot;Oh, they can do it if they really want to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we all got told to put our noses to the grindstone, to &quot;apply ourselves.&quot; Because they HAD seen that work. They had yelled at us, told us we were going to be punished or expelled or fired, and then seen us shape up. So let me tell you about the times when it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been nearly fired from every job I've had because I couldn't do basic tasks. I was given a long rope every time because they could &quot;see my potential&quot; and didn't want to lose me as a resource. And even at the zero hour, with unemployment looming, it was the hardest thing in my life to push through the brain fog and Get It Done. And every time I had to push myself that hard, I did piss poor work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why everyone thinks we're just lazy. They see us &quot;get our act together when it counts.&quot; They don't see all the times we tried that and failed, leading up to the crisis that finally pushed us enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's Not Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I want to emphasize: This condition isn't &quot;fun&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been asked before if I've ever been bored. And in a lot of senses the answer is no. I always have my imagination going, it's always making me think about things in incredible detail. But I don't get to choose what those things are. Sometimes you hyperfocus on something fun, sometimes on something dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fourteen I shirked all responsibilities and spent three months reading about vintage cameras, because that's what my mind latched onto. Every second that I wasn't reading about them I was thinking about them. I wasn't &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; anything, just consuming webpage after webpage of info about cameras from the 50s, 60s, 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got something out of it. I'm a good photographer now, because my obsession made me want to go out and take pictures, and I did, even when I had nothing to take pictures of, because it was the only thing I could think about. Was I &quot;having fun&quot;? I wouldn't say I was. I just had no other interests, no other desires, no other motivations. And I spent countless hours just staring at websites reading about stuff, and got nothing for it other than an immense knowledge of photographic trivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile there were other hobbies I wanted to focus on which sat by the wayside. I wanted to write, learn to draw, learn to program, play an instrument. I wanted to do those things, but my mind wouldn't let me. Photography is all I was permitted to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this disease is not an &quot;excuse&quot; to &quot;slack off&quot; or &quot;have a good time while everyone else is working.&quot; It's not a &quot;convenient excuse&quot; for not doing tedious things. It's not convenient. It's not fun. It's fucking miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be a bad employee. I do better on some days than others. I want to be incredibly productive, because as much as I hate capitalism, I have a work ethic and I want to achieve it. On days when I can't get myself to do hardly anything at work, I feel &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; because I WANT TO DO MY JOB. I DON'T LIKE BEING THIS WAY. I DON'T LIKE BEING A LAYABOUT. BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to come to work and put my head down and power through the day and feel accomplished even if all I did was labor for someone elses profits because &lt;em&gt;that is better than finishing the day with absolutely nothing to show for it for anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are treatments, as in drugs, but they aren't very consistent ones and the politics are muddied as hell because of the godforsaken DEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary drug is amphetamines such as Ritalin or Adderall. These are exactly what they sound like: stimulants. If you take a substantial dose you'll get fucked up, so they're prone to abuse. Hence, they're scheduled drugs. I don't want to talk about it in detail but I hate the DEA and I hate the war on drugs for causing countless people to be denied medication they really need, and this is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many doctors simply won't prescribe it. After the mid 2000s any request for stimulant ADHD medication to a GP is treated with suspicion and denied unless you have the order of a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are much the same way except you might &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; get the drugs - if you run their gauntlet of Lifestyle Changes and try other drugs first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't take this to mean you shouldn't try to get them. Several people, after reading this article, went to their GPs and got prescribed drugs that changed their lives. &lt;strong&gt;Do pursue this. Do try.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other drugs are, for the most part, bullshit. I was on Strattera for a while, which had no effect and made me sink into a deep black hole of existential despair every night until I started refusing to take it. I've heard much the same story with the other non-stimulant meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of that there's the &quot;zombie problem.&quot; The stimulant drugs work &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; - on some people. Others get turned into zombies, barely able to take care of themselves and drained of personality. Usually this happens when they're children, and the parents and doctor deny it's happening for long enough to cause trauma. Then that person goes on to distrust the drugs forever, and who can blame them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the stimulant drugs work, they don't work consistently. Some days they do, some days not. And over time they lose effectiveness, until you're having to up your dose regularly to keep things working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, though you might have luck with the drugs and you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; pursue trying them, ADHD is just something you live with. So the least we can have is some sympathy and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Cope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coping with ADHD sucks. It's miserable. I've found nothing that works consistently. I'm going to tell you about what I've tried and what I've had some success with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Important Things Done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first part focuses on the &quot;executive dysfunction,&quot; forgetfulness and unreliability aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, stop blaming yourself. I don't mean let your ADHD be an excuse for everything, but &lt;strong&gt;stop letting yourself feel like shit for not being normal.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn't your fault and you aren't making excuses. You aren't worthless. You are affected by a disorder, and while that shouldn't be a reason to give up on everything and just accept failure, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; start forgiving yourself. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; cut yourself some slack. You absolutely must, if you want to be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, start demanding forgiveness and understanding from others. This won't work with everyone. Your boss probably isn't going to do it - but if they're open to a conversation, have it. I did, with a boss that was understanding, and they started making accomodations for me that took me from the brink of getting fired to a top-performing employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been years since this occurred and I can't remember exactly what we discussed, but here is the crux of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We agreed that my condition was legitimate. This is important because it meant I wasn't hiding it. That didn't mean I couldn't get fired by failing to get things done, or that infinite excuses would be accepted; it meant I could &lt;em&gt;complain about it&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;plan around it&lt;/em&gt; without worrying about getting sneered at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We agreed that I was a valuable employee that they did not want to fire. This is important because it meant any conversation about my disability had a baseline of &quot;we both want to make this not matter, rather than punish me for it.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed what things are hard for me to achieve. This is important so my boss could tailor the things they asked of me. As long as I get things done, it shouldn't matter how they request them. It is a managers job to make their employees productive; part of that job &lt;em&gt;ought to be&lt;/em&gt; presenting tasks in the most palatable form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed what things would help me. This is important so my boss could know that by doing these specific things, they would not need to continue worrying about whether I was getting things done. In other words, since I can't be relied on to work like neurotypical employees, I told them what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; make me reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, and perhaps most importantly, I made it clear that I was not going to be able to deliver what other employees could, and we agreed that this was acceptable to a point. I am not interchangeable. There are things I can't do, that other employees should be tasked with instead. I believe any sensible boss understands this, and should never get upset that an employee is not as good at a particular type of task as another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear: I'm not saying your performance as a laborer under capitalism is the measure of your self-worth, but &lt;em&gt;if that is your goal&lt;/em&gt;, this may help you achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your family, friends and romantic partners though? Put a stop to it. Put your foot down. Tell them, &quot;I am sick and I will not be shamed for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that &lt;em&gt;does not mean&lt;/em&gt; that the people you are close to have no right to be &lt;em&gt;upset&lt;/em&gt;. If you forget to mail the rent check after being reminded and agreeing to do it for four days in a row, your roommates get to be angry. And you should feel bad, if you're trying to get better. You shouldn't feel like you have the license to screw up - if you think you absolutely can't be relied on, you need to not accept responsibilities. But if you're accepting tasks, you need to feel bad when you don't get them done because that will be the motivation that helps you develop better habits. &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;, however, is different from &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between &quot;God damnit, you didn't get the rent check in,&quot; and &quot;God damnit, you asshole, you didn't get the rent check in.&quot; Frustration is natural, but what you need to impress on people is that you didn't fail to do the task out of lack of respect for them or lack of appreciation of it's importance. You accepted that it was important and wanted to do it, &lt;em&gt;but you were unable to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk about becoming more reliable. All of this has to do with improving your habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, do everything as immediately as you can. It's the best advice I can give. It's worked better than anything else. When you realize you need to do something, if you can do it now, drop what you're doing and do it right away. Don't let yourself get stopped or distracted on the way to the task. If need be, repeat the task to yourself under your breath as you head to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, if you can't do something immediately, set up a reminder. If you don't have a smartphone, do you have someone who can remind you? Ask them to remind you at a time when you'll be in a place to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do have a smartphone, use reminders. Personally I think third party reminder apps are all garbage. I can't fully explain why so I'm not going to try. Check them out if you want, give them a shot, a lot of them have great features. I only use the built in ones, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you realize you need to do something later, set a reminder. Don't try to be precise; ballpark it. Set it to the earliest time you think you MIGHT be able to do the task. If that time comes and the reminder fires and you aren't in a place to do it, when you pull your phone out and see the reminder, immediately make a new one or update the time on the existing one to push it forward to the next time you think you'll be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never let yourself think, &quot;I'm busy but I'll be free in five minutes and I'll do it then.&quot; You will pull your phone out two hours later, see the reminder still on the screen, and kick yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day planner may help if you have trouble remembering what's happening in the future. I found that if I scheduled social activities (seeing a friend, going to a show) I would consistently forget when I had them planned. Reminders didn't help because I wouldn't think to scroll through them. Calendar items on my phone didn't help and I'm not sure why, but years of trying this and it never got better. I bought an actual paper day planner and since then I haven't had any trouble with scheduling mixups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It worked for 2-3 months. I haven't touched it since then and everything's a wreck again. I know why, and I'll explain. I call it the Scorched Earth Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with &quot;systems&quot; is that they are authorities. They have to be. If you decide &lt;em&gt;&quot;I'll prioritize things with a stack of notecards&quot;&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;you are telling yourself the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The notecards replace my own brain. Everything that I do must be on a notecard. If it isn't on a notecard, it can't be done. If I want it done, it has to be on a notecard.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when you have a crisis (a day full of emergencies) that forces you to break from this system you will lose all respect for its authority. Your brain will learn that it &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; have to respect the notecards, that they aren't in charge, and this sense of freedom is addictive and will persist. Most ADHD sufferers have left a trail of systems - notecards, whiteboards, lists, post-its, apps, alarms - that worked great for [a month, a week, three days] but are now dead to them, scorched earth we can't return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Fun Things Done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part focuses on getting the things done that you want to do, the hobbies and activities you have trouble focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most depressing aspects of ADHD. You can be a screwup who makes mistakes constantly and never handles their responsibilities and get by with an okay self esteem, but if you can't even have fun or indulge creative desires effectively you're going to be miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had trouble committing to creative projects for most of my life. In the last couple years I've started resolving those problems, and my primary solution was to emphasize positive reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if you'd agree, but my impression is that a major cultural zeitgeist is the idea that &quot;you shouldn't need anyone elses approval, you should live for yourself.&quot; This simply doesn't work for me. I'm not sure it works for anyone, but it definitely doesn't work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live for others approval because it's what keeps me going. The way I motivate myself to create is by telling myself the reward will be other peoples interactions. It's what's making me do this. Intellectually, I'm writing this because I feel a need to help other people. On a cognitive level, the reason I'm able to put pen to page as it were is because I told myself I'll get a lot of thanks and start a lot of good conversations online with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's why I was able to start a Youtube channel. It's the only thing that makes it possible for me to keep trying to learn music. It's the reason I do just about anything other than pure consumptive recreation like watching TV or playing a videogame. I motivate myself with others approval, and within reason, I can't tell you not to do this yourself. If you can create a following online, or at least know people on social media who will give you the feedback you need to do the stuff that you want to do, milk it. Leverage it. Do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's how I motivate myself at work. The things that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get me moving, the things that I can really get cracking on and do amazing work on, are things that will impress people. And I just let that power me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best advice I have. I hope it helps you. Good luck, and please love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Addendum: Pride And Shame Are Bastards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a pit that we all wind up in. No matter how self-aware we are, no matter how much we tell ourselves that we have a disadvantage that we may need help with, we still tell ourselves this awful, self-defeating lie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I know I can set reminders and change my habits, but if I can't do it like a normal person would, I'm a failure&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen closely: &lt;strong&gt;Cancel that shit.&lt;/strong&gt; You're beating yourself up for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your one life. This is now. This is happening. Maybe you can &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; your way out of ADHD but, just saying: I've never seen anyone pull that off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons we do this: Pride, shame, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride, because we all know we're &quot;smart kids&quot; (our parents and teachers told us so every time they scolded us) and we &quot;shouldn't need&quot; help. Bullshit. Everyone needs help. Take what you need and tell your pride to go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame, because we feel like everyone else can do this but we can't. Bullshit. Most people are struggling, if not with ADHD than with something else, and everyone with ADHD - &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; - is going through what you're going through. Trust me. I've talked to a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people, and even the ones who have great accomplishments to their name still deal with everything I've described and feel crushed under the weight of it. Just like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, because we think that the tricks and techniques we come up with to get through this are &quot;crutches&quot; that we might not have someday. Bullshit. Use what you can while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don't have an internet connection later? You have one now, so you're using it. What if you don't have a job later? You have one right now, so you're spending money. If you aren't learning Braille &lt;em&gt;just in case&lt;/em&gt; you go blind, don't force yourself through that process with this. Take the hand that's offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get on the drugs, get on them now. See if they work. Maybe they'll work so well that you'll blaze through a bunch of things you always wanted to do, and even if you stop taking them or can't get them later you'll still have those accomplishments. Maybe the emotional impact of seeing yourself finally achieving things will be so encouraging that it'll eradicate your feeling that you can't accomplish anything - speaking from experience, it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a smartphone, start using the reminders right now. It doesn't matter if you don't have internet everywhere, it'll work when you do, and you'll be no worse off when you don't. Use the voice recognition if you have it, and &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; beat yourself up about translation errors. A reminder that says &quot;take the harmful ham town&quot; is more effective than one that says &quot;take the garbage can out&quot; that I didn't set because typing it out was too tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't let yourself do what &lt;em&gt;smart people&lt;/em&gt; do: shoot yourself in the foot by trying to plan ahead for every contingency, every single possibility, and in doing so, never accomplish anything at all because you're afraid of a possible problem in the future. The problems will come one way or another. Take the easy way out while you can.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a messier subject. I am going to say things that will make everyone feel attacked regardless of what side of the issue they're on. Please understand that all the behavior I'm going to describe, while harmful and counterproductive, is &lt;em&gt;understandable.&lt;/em&gt; That doesn't mean it shouldn't change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three big issues with ADHD sufferers. Self-awareness, self-acceptance, and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Many people were never diagnosed. Cultural depictions of ADHD are as accurate as depictions of any other mental illness - that is, not in the least. Most people who I've described my experience to say, &quot;Wait, that's ADHD? I had no idea. I thought that was just how I was. I thought it was a personal failing.&quot; You may be the first person who's ever told someone that they may have this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-acceptance:&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote this article in the first place for people who have it, know it, but for one reason or another will not acknowledge its effects on their life. The most common reason, I would think, is that they believe the misconception that used to exist, that ADHD is a &quot;childhood illness&quot; that goes away over time. The psychiatric community, as I understand it, acknowledges that 1/3 to 2/3 of children retain symptoms well into adulthood. They also may not understand that ADHD is the cause of their problems. You may be the first person who's ever told someone that they are still being affected by this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stigma:&lt;/strong&gt; Our society deeply stigmatizes the behavior of ADHD sufferers. They are called lazy, apathetic. Failure to accomplish tasks is taken very personally as an indication of bad character: &quot;if you really cared you would have done what I asked&quot; or &quot;if it really mattered you would have remembered.&quot; These are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; traumatic accusations, often coming from parents, family and lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ADHD sufferer, almost without exception, has been accused of &lt;em&gt;being a bad person&lt;/em&gt; at least once in their life by someone they cared deeply about. The times they tried to explain that ADHD was the root of their failures were treated as disingenuous &quot;excuses&quot; intended to let them slide. And, on that note, and most importantly, ADHD does not get better. It is a lifelong condition, to the best of anyones knowledge. Drugs may help, coping may help, but &lt;em&gt;this is how you are.&lt;/em&gt; The mistakes you make because of it are ones you will probably continue to make, especially if you don't have access to medication or effective coping mechanisms and assistive tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for ADHD sufferers, the specific mistakes that they make are ones that strike a nerve with many people. To understand how to live with them easier, you need to understand what's going on in their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD sufferers are often unreliable, and cause harm inadvertently as a result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You SAID you would take the power bill to the post office, and you didn't, so now we have a late fee! Again!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of confrontation goes poorly for one specific reason: the accused person responds, &quot;I'm sorry, I really meant to do it,&quot; and then a critical error, &quot;it won't happen again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to say, &quot;this will never get better&quot; or &quot;you cannot ever be reliable,&quot; because it isn't true. But an ADHD sufferer's knee-jerk reaction is self-blame. &quot;Oh my god, I really messed up, and it's bad, and &lt;em&gt;I should have cared enough to get this right&lt;/em&gt;, and I'll do better next time.&quot; They're wrong about why they messed up. They think they have bad priorities - and thus, they think &lt;em&gt;they are a bad person&lt;/em&gt; - and this creates a feedback loop, where each time they mess up they remember that they promised to improve, and that makes the shame intensify. The more times they've done it, the worse the shame is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And believe me: ADHD sufferers know how many times they've forgotten to take the trash out on trash night. But you may be the first person to ever tell them it's okay to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is my advice on how to help someone who has ADHD. A partner, a family member, a friend, a coworker or a subordinate, though I'll just say &quot;friend&quot; here to save space. Whether you're neurotypical or even if you have ADHD yourself, these things will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to drop the judgment. That doesn't mean you can't get upset that your friend messed up. It means that you need to remind yourself to think of ADHD before you think of malice, and you can't personally attack them for a specific error. It's counterproductive and harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your friend forgets to take the trash out for the second week in a row and you lose your shit because you now have nowhere to put trash and the apartment stinks, yes, you're going to get angry. I'm not telling you to hold all that back. If you have to blow up, blow up, but you need to keep one finger tensed to hold back the ad hominem, the &quot;christ, you ALWAYS do this,&quot; and the &quot;are you even TRYING&quot; and the &quot;why don't you GIVE A SHIT.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you need to express that you understand and that you're prepared to offer forgiveness as long as your friend is doing their best. This part is critical: I am not here to tell you how to treat your friends. I do not subscribe to the notion that I can tell you, a perfect stranger, the grounds upon which you can eject someone from your life etc. However, a healthy approach to coping with ADHD requires both acceptance &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; feedback when mistakes are made. ADHD does not mean your friend gets carte blanche to screw up all day and never apologize for anything. If they want to do better they still need to make an effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, work with them to develop solutions. People with ADHD do not get a pamphlet with coping skills and they have to be tailored to the person. Discuss things you have frequent issues with and come up with solutions ahead of time. &lt;em&gt;Accept a certain amount of blame when things go wrong, if you deserve it.&lt;/em&gt; If part of the solution that you &lt;em&gt;agreed on&lt;/em&gt; was &quot;I will remind you to do &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; at 3PM&quot; and then you don't do it, your friend is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; culpable for forgetting. If that feels unfair, ask yourself: are you looking for a solution to practical issues, or upset that your friend isn't &quot;doing the right thing&quot;? The latter is a bad look, in my opinion, if you care about them. However, it's up to you to decide how much emotional labor you're willing to perform for that person. I cannot make that determination for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, point out possible gaps before they happen. Remember that the ADHD is self-reinforcing - the same inability to remember to do tasks keeps people from remembering to use their coping tools and techniques. So when your friend says, &quot;okay, I'll take the trash out,&quot; you can reply, &quot;set a reminder on your phone.&quot; If your friend has been significantly traumatized by past conflicts they may react to this poorly, because it can feel like someone saying, &quot;I know you're going to screw up,&quot; before they've even had a chance to try, so a rapport and understanding have to exist. You can also offer, &quot;I'll bug you again in an hour&quot; and set a reminder on &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; phone. Again, if that feels unfair, consider what your desired outcome is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, encourage your friend to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take tasks they feel uncertain about. Like almost any mental health issue, there are good and bad days. If they don't believe they're up to a particular task and are stressed out by worries about failure, it may be best to say, &quot;I don't think I can promise to get that done.&quot; Again, this requires a rapport and understanding and has to be used in moderation so it doesn't turn into hermit behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope these methods help you develop a better relationship or a more functional home. Good luck to you and your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;A brigade of paratroopers deployed in early January to the Middle East in the wake of mounting tensions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/16/us-military-may-send-missile-defense-batteries-to-the-middle-east-in-wake-of-iran-strike/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has been asked by its leadership to use two encrypted messaging applications on government cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The use of the encrypted messaging applications Signal and Wickr by the 82nd Airborne’s Task Force Devil underscores the complexity of security and operations for U.S. forces deployed to war zones where adversaries can exploit American communications systems, cell phones and the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;But it also raises questions as to whether the Department of Defense is scrambling to fill gaps in potential security vulnerabilities for American forces operating overseas by relying on encrypted messaging apps available for anyone to download in the civilian marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“All official communication on government cell phones within TF Devil has been recommended to use Signal or Wickr encrypted messaging apps,” Maj. Richard Foote, a spokesman for the 1st Brigade Combat Team, told Military Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“These are the two apps recommended by our leadership, as they are encrypted and free for download and use,” Foote said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Foote added that there is no operational discussions via the apps and an extra layer of security is provided because users must go through virtual private networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;However, there are government transparency concerns with the use of encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Wickr, which feature auto-delete functions where messages are erased after a set period of time. Electronic communications and text messages sent as part of official government business are part of the public record, and should be accessible via a Freedom of Information Act request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Department of Defense did not respond to queries from Military Times regarding government records keeping policies and whether Signal and Wickr have been audited for security flaws by the DoD. Military Times has reached out to the National Security Agency, and has yet to receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Operational planners and military commanders rely on government cell phones for basic menial tasks from scheduling and daily muster even when deployed overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Foote told Military Times that there is “no requirement for extensive use of cell phones for work communication” for the deployed 82nd paratroopers.&lt;/p&gt;

(Spc. Hubert Delany III/U.S. Army via AP)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“If cell phones are used, we have taken the best steps, readily available, to ensure the best security of our transmissions,” Foote explained&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“To be clear, the term “official communication” in this setting refers to coordination of assets, sharing of meeting time changes, etc. There is no operational discussion on these platforms,” Foote said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Adversaries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/09/this-is-what-its-like-to-survive-a-deadly-rocket-attack-in-iraq/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, which boast robust cyber and electronic warfare capabilities can glean much information from phone collections and basic text messages that could highlight daily patterns on an installation or sudden shifts and changes in schedules — potential indications of pending operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;But Foote explained to Military Times that the 82nd’s government cell communications include an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“When official business is being conducted via cell, it is done on the apps over VPN-protected [virtual private network] connections…systems reviewed and recommended by our Communications and Cyber sections,” Foote said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2016, Signal received a positive security review when it was audited by the International Association for Cryptologic Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“We have found no major flaws in the design,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IACR&lt;/a&gt; said in its 2016 security audit of Signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;A former military intelligence operator who has extensive experience working with the special operations community told Military Times that the Signal app was “very secure” with no known bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;He explained that the 82nd Airborne’s reliance on the app for government cell communications wasn’t necessarily an indication that the DoD was behind the curve on protecting cellphone security for deployed troops. The former intelligence operator said he believed the DoD was just being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“Unfortunately, those apps are more secure than texting in the clear, which is more or less the alternative. Granted, if a hostile party has access to the handset, that encryption isn’t particularly helpful,” a former U.S. defense official told Military Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;The former U.S. defense official, who spoke to Military Times on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said the DoD should use commercial applications as long as they are tested and meet security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t have confidence that DoD could build a unique texting system with proper security protocols that would beat any commercial, off the shelf, version,” the former official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;With regards to transparency and records keeping requirements, Foote said he “cannot confirm if any personnel have Signal or Wickr settings which allow auto-delete of messages at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Military Times has not been able to confirm if Signal and Wickr have been audited for security flaws and vulnerabilities by the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;o-articleBody__text a-body1 element element-paragraph&quot;&gt;Officials from Signal and Wickr did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NOAA Satellites Helped Save a Record 421 Lives in 2019</title>

<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;NOAA’s polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites are part of the global Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking System, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cospas-sarsat.int/en/&quot; class=&quot; ext-link-after&quot;&gt;COSPAS-SARSAT&lt;span class=&quot;element-invisible&quot;&gt;offsite link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a network of U.S. and international spacecraft to detect and locate distress signals from emergency beacons aboard aircraft, boats and from handheld Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Of the 421 U.S. rescues last year, 306 were water rescues, 38 were from aviation incidents and 77 were from events on land, where PLBs were used. Florida had the most SARSAT rescues with more than 100, followed by Alaska with more than 50. The previous rescue record of 353 (total) was set in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graphic showing three categories of satellite-assisted rescues that took place in 2019: Of the 421 rescues that year, 306 were water rescues, 38 were from aviation incidents, and 77 were from events on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When a NOAA satellite pinpoints the location of a distress signal in the U.S., the information is relayed to the SARSAT Mission Control Center at NOAA’s Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland. From there, the information is sent quickly to Rescue Coordination Centers, operated either by the U.S. Air Force for land rescues, or the U.S. Coast Guard for water rescues. NOAA also supports rescues globally by relaying distress signal information to international SARSAT partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Each person rescued underscores the success of nearly 40 years of teamwork with the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Air Force, NASA and our international partners,” said Steve Volz, Ph.D., assistant NOAA administrator for its Satellite and Information Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In one harrowing case last year, the impact of the crash of a small aircraft near Skwentna, Alaska, activated the emergency beacon onboard. The Alaska Rescue Coordination Center relayed the distress location to the Alaska Air National Guard responders, who pulled the two passengers from the wreckage and they received medical treatment at an area hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In another rescue, six people were saved from a sinking boat 20 miles east of Sunny Isles, Florida. The U.S. Coast Guard received the emergency beacon alert and directed an emergency response boat to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since its start in 1982, COSPAS-SARSAT has been credited with supporting more than 48,000 rescues worldwide, including nearly more than 9,000 in the United States and its surrounding waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By law, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/beacon.html&quot;&gt;beacon owners are required to register their devices online&lt;/a&gt; with NOAA. The registration information helps provide better and faster assistance to people in distress, and can guard against false alarms. It may also provide information about the location of the emergency and what type of help may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;6.6410256410256&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mint.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; personal-finance service wants me to know it’s sorry. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--native_mid_article_inject&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;38.517169179229&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re sorry!” its investments page bleats when I try to view my mutual funds’ performance. “Our graphs require the latest version of Adobe Flash player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That site has spent years apologizing to me for needing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3049920/the-agonizingly-slow-decline-of-adobe-flash-player&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Adobe’s vulnerability-riddled plug-in&lt;/a&gt;: since I long ago booted Flash from my browser, since Adobe &lt;a href=&quot;https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-flash-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;said in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that it would drop Flash by the end of 2020, since Intuit told me in 2018 that Mint would wean itself from Flash &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2018/09/24/googles-latest-chrome-update-tightens-locks-adobe-flash/1348935002/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“in the coming months.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s in keeping with this fossilized financial tool. Mint still provides a valuable service for free in aggregating transaction data from multiple financial institutions to clarify where your money comes and goes—and in the bargain suggests hopefully-better financial products from advertisers—but this app exhibits severe symptoms of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if Mint, with 13 million-plus registered users,&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; w&lt;/span&gt;ere a resource-constrained startup instead of a property of Intuit, the Microsoft of personal finance. But more than a decade after the firm behind TurboTax and QuickBooks (and, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/intuit-sells-quicken-unit-to-h-i-g-capital/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;until 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Quicken) bought Mint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/1356374/mint-sells-intuit-170-million-will-it-wither-vine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;for $170 million&lt;/a&gt;, neatly taking a competitor off the map, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/21/AR2008052102672.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;once-groundbreaking app&lt;/a&gt; might as well be streaked with cobwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In my mind, it’s been in maintenance mode the last eight years,” says Aaron Patzer, the founder of Mint who accepted Intuit’s offer, found himself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/1700439/why-mintcom-founder-aaron-patzer-hated-quicken&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tasked with improving Quicken&lt;/a&gt;, and then left the company in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be doing much more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Aaron Patzer, founder of Mint&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mint.com/category/updates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“updates” category of Mint’s blog&lt;/a&gt; reveals no new features since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mint.com/updates/understand-your-money-better-with-mintsights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;April 2019’s revised financial-advice interfaces&lt;/a&gt; in the mobile apps it introduced soon after the acquisition. It does report an outright retreat, the quiet scrapping in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mint.com/updates/mint-bill-payment-feature-no-longer-supported/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;June 2018&lt;/a&gt; of bill-payment tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mint.com/updates/billpay/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;introduced in December 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;41.552486187845&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit has, however, made one less-obvious upgrade: switching account synchronization with some big-name institutions from a username-and-password exchange to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.mint.com/Accounts-and-Transactions/939542541/What-s-new-about-my-bank-connections.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;a more secure OAuth sync in which Mint no longer stores your password&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit spokesman Rick Heineman lists other additions in an email: the ability to track cash transactions (added in 2010), a credit-score lookup (2014), and more recent tweaks to its insights and recommendations.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; Given Mint’s huge potential—and the rapid pace of improvement for other web-based services—that’s an alarmingly skimpy list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missed opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patzer’s summary of his baby’s stunted growth: “It could be doing much more.” He points in particular to the lack of integration between Mint and TurboTax, saying, “I had a dream that TurboTax would take you about five minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of TurboTax, which Intuit zealously defends by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90332266/the-best-way-to-file-your-taxes-is-the-one-that-terrible-politicians-keep-blocking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;lobbying to stop governments from offering their own tax-prep apps&lt;/a&gt;, may help explain why Mint has gone neglected.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Patzer estimates that TurboTax generates 10 to 20 times the revenue of Mint. Intuit doesn’t break out that proportion—Heineman says, “Anything you have heard from Aaron or others is just speculation”—but its executives have left Mint out of prepared remarks for the company’s last five &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.intuit.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;quarterly-earnings calls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href=&quot;https://s23.q4cdn.com/935127502/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/Fact-Sheet-FY'20-Q1-External_v5.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2019 fiscal year&lt;/a&gt;, Intuit’s consumer sector (basically, Mint and TurboTax) generated $2.775 billion in revenue, versus $3.533 billion for its small business and self-employed division, which is dominated by its QuickBooks accounting software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software that people pay for—annually—TurboTax follows a business model that Intuit mastered decades ago. By contrast, Patzer says, Mint’s referral fees for sign-ups through the app yielded “lumpy” income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;37.416485900217&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In your first two to three months, on average we were making something like $20 per user,” he says. “In the next three months, maybe $2 or $3.” It could not have helped when Mint &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/989865583310196736&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;presented users with ads for credit cards they already had&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Val Agostino, who was Mint’s director of product engineering in the early days, says pressure for revenue drove the company in two unhelpful directions. The service could “present users with financial offers that yielded the highest commission,” he emails, or “increase the number of offers a user saw in a given session.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agostino is now cofounder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monarchmoney.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Monarch&lt;/a&gt;, a subscription-based personal-finance app due to launch this year.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;That happens to be the business model Intuit itself pursued when it launched its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/21/AR2008052102672.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;would-have-been Mint rival Quicken Online&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2008 as a $2.99/month Web app—before &lt;a href=&quot;http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/07/intuit_quashes_quicken_online.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;closing it in 2010 in favor of shifting its attention to Mint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Intuit buying out its own competitor, in turn, echoed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-21-mn-4463-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s failed attempt two decades earlier to purchase Intuit&lt;/a&gt;, which had trounced its Microsoft Money software.)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Mint benefits from a lack of serious competition. Quicken requires an annual subscription and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quicken.com/support/can-i-install-quicken-multiple-computers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;remains desktop-bound&lt;/a&gt;, with a continued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quicken.com/about-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;mismatch of Mac and Windows features&lt;/a&gt;. The free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.personalcapital.com/see-how-it-works&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; web app is more geared toward investment management.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of Mint’s failure to evolve and improve, its core functionality—putting your accounts in one free and easily scanned dashboard—continues to be fundamentally useful. That was the ability that led &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; to call it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/61235/easy-money-mintcom-ceo-aaron-patzer-merging-personal-finance-web-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“the Axe Bodyspray of personal finance–cool, fresh, and even sexy&lt;/a&gt;.” Any competitor will need to provide the same quick answers to “how much did I make?” and “where did I spend it?” before scaring Intuit out of its apathy.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as Patzer says of the app, which he continues to use himself: “It solves a real need.”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Why I Procrastinate (2019)</title>
<link>https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Why I Procrastinate&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/thumb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit more serious than the typical tech-related articles I write. But I'm doing this for a reason. &lt;strong&gt;I'm writing about this because procrastination is something I've been struggling with for a very long while.&lt;/strong&gt; However, I feel like I've finally got a lead on the why! I'm excited, and I just want to share my experiences with all of you so, if you or someone you know are like me, they can get the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Example: How I Do Homework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start at the beginning, the most obvious example. There's homework I need to do. It's pretty important, but it won't kill my grade if I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; do it. What do I do? How do I feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's about how it typically goes: I get home from class, and, because either it's on a consistent schedule or because I wrote it down in my phone's calendar, &lt;strong&gt;I know I have to do a homework assignment&lt;/strong&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do the homework assignment. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this. If I get the thing done I'll have the whole rest of my day to do the things I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Schedule view of day, showing the current time to be at the end of lunch and several hours before class, with &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; written in between&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/time_1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say it's about lunch time, and I have a couple of hours until my next class. I'll go to my dorm to get lunch, use the restroom, grab something from my room I forgot. But it typically seems to end in disaster for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz lying in bed scrolling through the internet on her phone, looking a little upset and annoyed&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/bed.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I enter my dorm room it feels like I'm sucked into the comfort of my bed. It's incredibly hard to resist, and incredibly dangerous if it's taunting reels me in. When that happens, &lt;strong&gt;I just get stuck there for a while&lt;/strong&gt;, doomed to refresh Twitter or Reddit long after doing so is fun. I don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do this, at least not for more than 30 minutes or so. By the end (an hour or two later) I'm screaming at myself in my head to &lt;em&gt;just do the thing already, jeez&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It's as if there's something inside of me that just &lt;em&gt;doesn't want to move&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm clever about it, I'll catch myself and try to go directly to the library, leaving lunch for later. And if I I do that, I can usually get myself to at least &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to work on the assignment. But even in a comfortable, distraction-free environment with everything I need in front of me, &lt;strong&gt;pushing forwards and &lt;em&gt;doing the thing&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly difficult.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try to read the first problem and my eyes will just sort of &lt;em&gt;gloss over it&lt;/em&gt; and won't take it in. Coming up with a strategy to tackle it will be surprisingly difficult, no matter how obvious it seems. I'll come up with a plan, like &quot;look up this word in the textbook&quot;, and &lt;strong&gt;it feels like I quickly lose that step, as if it keeps slipping out of my grasp and I have to chase after it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz holding a book and disinterested.&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/outside.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll find instead that I just sort of sit there. &lt;strong&gt;My mind flutters&lt;/strong&gt; from the window to reading the little scribbles people left on the desk to my imagination and then back out again. Every couple of minutes I'll push forwards hard enough do one little task. Get out a pencil. Get out my notebook. Turn my notebook to the right page. Open the website with the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the moment I encounter any resistance at all, even as simple as &quot;bah, I have to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; the pencil in my backpack&quot; or &quot;I need to go flip through the book until I'm at the right one&quot;, I'll seize up again and lose focus. Solving the problems like this is, as you could probably guess, nigh-on impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A Wikipedia rabbithole on the computer screen, with the homework set aside&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/distracted.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I lose my train of thought, &lt;strong&gt;I'm really prone to letting my thoughts get off on the worst tangents, and it will take a while to get myself back on track.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, suppose a question in my homework asks me to find the efficiency of a solar panel. I'll start reading the textbook to figure out how to solve the problem. Then I come across a sentence like &quot;Solar cell efficiency is rarely above 30% for most solar panels&quot;. Good to know as a ballpark for my results, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. This makes me start wondering what the &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt; solar panels are like, so I open up the Wikipedia page on solar panel efficiency. This leads me to learning that in the 70's Jimmy Carter installed some (rather inefficient) solar panels on the roof of the White House. &lt;strong&gt;An hour later and I haven't started the homework problem&lt;/strong&gt;, but I could tell you a surprising amount about the 1973 oil crisis and it's effect on the American automobile industry. (It's why all the cars were really small back then!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/fidget.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Viz in a few states of fidgeting, such as swishing her ghost tail from side to side or rocking back and forth in her chair or staring out the window while bouncing her leg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait, there's more! I'll get distracted by windows, slightly off ceiling tiles, the shelves of books next to me, fire extinguishers, cracks in the plaster, and &lt;em&gt;my own thoughts&lt;/em&gt;. I'll even get distracted by &lt;em&gt;my own body!&lt;/em&gt; I often find myself bouncing my legs or bouncing back and forth in my seat, stuck in a daydream, totally absorbed in the rhythm. &lt;strong&gt;If my mind's set on not doing the thing then &lt;em&gt;it will find distractions&lt;/em&gt; so it can not do the thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz, panicking to get something done, visibly unhappy&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/stress_push.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there does seem to be &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing that forces me to focus on something: &lt;em&gt;stress&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;If there's a very important deadline coming up, or the consequences of me not doing something become bad enough, I'll do the thing.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be &lt;em&gt;garbage&lt;/em&gt;, it'll be the bare minimum. but typically it will get done. If I have enough time, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be decent, but the stress often doesn't become overwhelming until I'm right at the edge of the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But it's not always like this?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you could probably guess, all of this is rather disastrous for getting anything done. ...but I have gotten stuff done. I'm decently far in college. I have this whole website. I didn't make it this far out of &lt;em&gt;sheer luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz hugging a sandbag labeled 'fun stuff'&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/hobbies_luv.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is &lt;strong&gt;I only seem to be an unfocused mess around things that don't catch my interest.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise? I'll grab on and &lt;em&gt;never let go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever I'm stuck on will be &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; I can think about.&lt;/strong&gt; When I'm trying to do other things my mind will just jump back to that, distracting me from what I'm trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common examples for me are &lt;strong&gt;endless Wikipedia browsing with no point, or jumping between Twitter and Reddit forever.&lt;/strong&gt; This typically ends either when I can force myself back on what I'm &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be doing, or my own bodily needs outweigh whatever I'm stuck on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to stick with something a little longer when it happens to be something I'm both interested in and &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be interested in. Let's take my endless fascination with video game modification. It's a super engaging and fun problem to try and hack a game. When I'm stuck on it, I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to figure out how the game ticks because it's just &lt;em&gt;what my brain craves&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It almost feels like feeding an addiction&lt;/strong&gt;, except it's at least productive in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm stuck in this state where a project is all I can think about, I give it my all. Surprisingly enough, the results tend to be pretty good. Months later I can look at all of that stuff and not even really comprehend how I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, something I find interesting is that when I'm stuck on something like this, &lt;strong&gt;distractions like bouncing my leg or listening to music don't make me lose my focus at all.&lt;/strong&gt; If &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, they help me focus &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. It's the strangest thing, it's like I need the stimulation or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I Needed Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that motivated me to seek help about this was the realization that &lt;em&gt;this was effecting a LOT of my life&lt;/em&gt;. This is more than just homework or getting stuck on fun hobbies. My procrastination or whatever was starting to wear on me, &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz's sandbag o' fun slips out and launches into the air&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/hobbies_escape.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large problem is that &lt;strong&gt;I &lt;em&gt;can't choose&lt;/em&gt; when I'm interested in something.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, a big thing I'm known for is &lt;a href=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/hacks/sonicr&quot;&gt;modding Sonic R&lt;/a&gt;. I've been largely burnt out it for months, though. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/projects/redux&quot;&gt;Sonic Redux&lt;/a&gt;, my big Sonic R mod from 2017, was mostly done in intense little spurts with absolutely nothing for months in between besides feeling like garbage for not having the motivation to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/projects/aquaashes&quot;&gt;the Game Boy game I'm currently working on&lt;/a&gt; is turning out the same way. I had a major push last summer where I did nothing but chip away at it, and then just sort of fizzled out as I lost interest. Every time I've tried to work on it recently, I'm just the same unfocused procrastinating mess I am towards other stuff. I don't understand why. I enjoy working on it, even if I'm in a bit of a rut right now. &lt;strong&gt;I want to see it finished. I just &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz struggling to juggle responsibilities (literally)&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/juggle.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. Take that mindset and add responsibilities to it. Taxes, emails, homework and tests and obligations and promises. I can (and have, multiple times, sometimes even skipping class to make time) set aside an entire day to do one important task. And unless I'm in the right headspace, it's like pulling teeth to get it done. I struggle to do my laundry on a regular basis. I have 3 unread emails relating to some code I wrote that have been sitting there since &lt;em&gt;January&lt;/em&gt;, probably telling me problems I've been aware of since January &lt;em&gt;of last year&lt;/em&gt;. (I eventually checked them sometime during the writing of this article.) In high school I could barely get myself to apply to jobs or colleges or scholarships. My grades are not as good as I think they could be if I could just &lt;em&gt;not procrastinate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz stuck to a sandbag while her surroundings are on fire&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/hobbies_fire.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the moments where I can't help &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; focus on something? Turns out it isn't healthy. I must stress: my brain latches onto these things &lt;em&gt;at the exclusion of everything else&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall, during the crunch time of Redux's development, I just didn't eat lunch or even dinner some days. It wasn't a conscious choice or anything. It &lt;em&gt;literally did not occur to me&lt;/em&gt; that I needed to eat food until I became so unbearably hungry that I had to make something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could literally have tornado sirens and EAS alerts going off around me and I still wouldn't budge. That's not even an exaggeration, that literally happened once. &lt;strong&gt;I didn't notice I was in danger because I was so engrossed in what I was doing.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone had to get my attention and snap me out of it before I realized what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's &lt;em&gt;fascinating&lt;/em&gt; is that &lt;strong&gt;this &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; an every day thing&lt;/strong&gt;. Most days it's like this it feels, but on some days I can just sit down and &lt;em&gt;do the homework&lt;/em&gt;. And it's pretty easy. And I wonder what the heck I was making a big fuss about because come on Viz, that only took you 30 minutes. And then the very next day I'll work on a different assignment for the same class and it feels impossible again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What's Up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late, I've found that stress no longer motivates me like it does. I've used stress as my crutch before, and it's not working anymore. Thankfully I can still motivate myself well enough for the really important stuff like taxes or course registrations, but I'm slipping. Hard. I've actually failed my first class this semester, simply because I was behind and I could not catch up. (Spending time writing this instead of studying probably didn't help much. :P)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked this over with my therapist. We came to the mutual conclusion that &lt;strong&gt;I have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;. What is ADHD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention Deficit&lt;/strong&gt; - I have trouble regulating my attention, either not being able to focus on something or not being able to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; focusing on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt; - A low-key constant need for motion or stimulation of some sort, like the leg bouncing I was mentioning earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disorder&lt;/strong&gt; - This is negatively effecting my life in multiple areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...yep. That sounds about right. &lt;strong&gt;But that's not what I thought ADHD was?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debunking old stereotypes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The myth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular media always paints ADHD as a label you put on rowdy young school boys who just need to sit down and shut up, and where &quot;Big Pharma&quot; pumps out sedation drugs and ruins our children's future. One particularly bleak image is &lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DW_dyBBaOTQ/S4lz8jyaO2I/AAAAAAAAFnI/ySM3zUl_VK0/s640/calvin-hobbes-pills.jpg&quot;&gt;this fake Calvin and Hobbes strip&lt;/a&gt; where Calvin loses his imagination and is turned into a zombie because of the evil pressures of Big Pharma, the American education system, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to stress, &lt;strong&gt;these stereotypes come from misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;. I looked at some old newspaper and magazine articles to get to the bottom of this. (See links at bottom of page.) From what I could gather, &lt;strong&gt;parents' concerns started innocent, and then were severely blown out of proportion. The effects of past fears linger on to this day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents of the time were concerned that stimulant medication was being used as a &quot;replacement for education&quot;. The only reason it was needed, they claimed, was due to the rising pressures of modern society, and that they were in the long term harmful. There were reports that schools forced kids on medication against their will, that psychologists suggested putting Ritalin in the water supply, and that children on stimulant medication did things such as bang their head against windows in agony, becoming hostile and suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I strongly believe that &lt;strong&gt;a lot of the more distressing examples from these articles were exaggerated or flat-out fabricated&lt;/strong&gt;. Looking at everything, most talk against stimulation medications comes from the &quot;Citizen's Commission on Human Rights International&quot;. Looking them up, I was surprised to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062990a-story.html&quot;&gt;that it was a sock-puppet organization created by the Church of Scientology with the express purpose to discredit psychology as a whole.&lt;/a&gt; Through their efforts, along with other well-meaning but horribly misinformed groups, the very idea of ADHD and especially ADHD medications has been demonized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's not to say that there aren't legitimate concerns&lt;/strong&gt; regarding the potential for overdiagnosis, the interests of the American pharmaceutical industry, the side effects of stimulant medication, and the pressure on children and college students to be good at schoolwork. Those are all very serious problems that society needs to address. However, if you were to go solely by popular culture you'd get the impression that ADHD is a fictitious disorder, and it's not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, &lt;strong&gt;ADHD is more than just not paying attention in school, and the diagnosis requires that it severely and negatively effects many portions of one's life.&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD effect's people's jobs, their home life, their ability to acheive their dreams and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html&quot;&gt;current DSM criteria for diagnosing ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, you can see just how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; it effects one's life, and how &lt;em&gt;strict&lt;/em&gt; the requirements for diagnosis are. In addition, modern psychologists overwhelmingly agree that stimulant medication, when responsibly prescribed, are immensely helpful in combating the symptoms of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;there's been an increase lately &lt;em&gt;adult&lt;/em&gt; ADHD diagnoses, especially in women&lt;/strong&gt;. ADHD was once thought to go away once childhood ends, but researches are increasingly finding that this is only true &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/04/adhd-adults-childhood/1953789/&quot;&gt;Many adults struggle with the symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and don't realize it because of the stigma surrounding it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/adhd-is-different-for-women/381158/&quot;&gt;Women especially are a concern&lt;/a&gt; because they don't usually exhibit hyperactive traits, which combined with the old stereotype of &quot;rowdy young boy&quot; leads to a lot of missed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is real, some people have it, and I'm one of them. I'm not rowdy, I'm not a boy, and I'm not in elementary school, &lt;em&gt;and yet I still have ADHD&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms I Have&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a better lens to view all of this from, let me go back and put some more accurate names on things, and maybe find some new things I didn't know I was struggling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Executive Dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/bed.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inability to sit down and focus on something is referred to as &lt;em&gt;Executive Dysfunction&lt;/em&gt;. It leads to &lt;strong&gt;issues in time management, planning, and short-term memory.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/executive-dysfunction#outlook&quot;&gt;Here's a fairly readable overview of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitting that into my life, it mostly seems to hold true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am awful at time management, hence the whole procrastination thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; my short term memory is okay, but I know that if someone tells me a list of things I need to do or a locations I need to go to, I will have a hard time remembering them unless I write them down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty good at planning stuff out, so long as I have a concrete goal I need to accomplish. It tends to break down &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; with more abstract goals, though, like &quot;study for this test&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hyperfocus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/hobbies_fire.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That state where I get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; stuck on things thing is called &lt;em&gt;hyperfixation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;hyperfocus&lt;/em&gt;. Briefly, it's &lt;strong&gt;when you can't regulate your attention away from something, even if you really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to, and even if it's not enjoyable.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if there's something more urgent or useful I could be doing, if I'm hyperfocused on something it will be hard to break out of that and even harder to do what I'm supposed to, because I'm so mentally fixated on the meaningless nonsense I got sucked into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is related to but distinct from being in &quot;flow&quot;, or &quot;in the zone&quot;. Flow refers to the state of mind when you're willingly engrossed in something, as if the rest of the world is just tuned out, and you find yourself deeply enjoying what you're doing, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; stop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://keepbizzy.com/hyperfocus-vs-flow/&quot;&gt;Here's some more reading on the two, if you're interested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible (and somewhat frequent) that I hyperfixate on something that's important, and instead of trying to break free I just let it happen and enter a state of flow. Or I can go from not being able to focus on anything to gradually warming up to something to being in flow. It's a very complicated relationship between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hyperactivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/fidget_c.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, it's worth nothing that in 1994, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) were merged into just ADHD, but with two subtypes: inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive. Someone could have one or both. (Or none, of course. Lucky ducks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm more on the inattentive side. I don't spend a lot of money on things I don't need, I don't blurt out words or leave my seat during class, etc. like some people that lean more hyperactive-impulsive may do. But I still have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; hyperactive traits. A big one is that every rare once in a while I'm just indescribably in the mood to be active, like a little pent up ball of energy. So I'll get on my bike and get lost in the city and bike for about 6 miles or so until I've worn myself out. I don't ever give myself a set path when I'm doing that, I just go wherever feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classic one I've already mentioned is fidgeting. If I'm stuck in a chair, I almost always need to keep something moving, whether that be bouncing my leg up and down because that feels good, or pushing the end of my pen against my desk repeatedly so that it almost-but-not-quite clicks. &lt;strong&gt;At it's rare worst, I become so antsy that it feels like staying in my seat is a real struggle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Head Noise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really isn't a term I've heard anywhere else, but it echoes the sentiments I've heard from other people on the Internet with ADHD, so I'll stick with it. You know how you listen to a catchy song, and then it gets stuck in your head? Imagine that except forever. While your mind is running around it's hyperfixation. And sometimes there's a second song, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find it extraordinarily difficult to just... relax.&lt;/strong&gt; Sit on a bench and watch the clouds. I can do it, sometimes. I love the physical feeling of spring breezes and warm jackets and grass and dirt and trees. Likewise, I love the mental feeling of having nothing I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if I'm in that perfect scenario where there's nothing to do... my brain will just fill the void with absurd daydreams and rabbithole trains of thought. Living in the moment and just smelling the roses is can be difficult at times because my mind can't just hold onto that feeling of nothing. &lt;strong&gt;My brain has to constantly be stimulated by &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a decent bit of controversy behind this term, mostly because it's a new term not (currently) recognized by any scientific organization. That said, it does seem to resonate with a lot of people with ADHD, myself included, so I'll use it anyways with that disclaimer in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way I can describe it is... with the name. I am sensitive to rejection, because it causes dysphoria (bad feelings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain a little more concretely. Say I take a test or do a homework assignment, and I get a grade. I don't look at the grade. Almost ever. Even if it's a good grade. I really should, in some cases it would help me out a lot. But &lt;strong&gt;something about the idea that what I did wasn't enough just stings at a really deep level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even worse when it comes to things I some amount of heart and soul into. Bringing Redux back out as an example, I just felt something between anxiety and just a deep sinking feeling in the gut at all the comments saying that I needed to work on the art more. Which, yeah, in hindsight, the art was pretty bad. I don't want to make anyone who said anything like that feel bad; it was something I needed to hear. But in that moment those comments &lt;em&gt;stung&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is more than just &quot;I don't take criticism well&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; It's deeper than that. More emotional than that. It's dreading being called into the boss's office at work because you're mortified of the worst. It's bursting into tears at the possibility of failing a class, or getting detention. It's letting people walk over you because you don't want to upset anyone. It's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of that, I am thankful that I don't have nearly as bad of ADHD symptoms as I could. &lt;strong&gt;There are other people who suffer far, far worse than I do.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm in a pretty good university, I have a career path ahead of me, and until very recently I've been doing well enough in all of my classes. Other people don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; those luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html&quot;&gt;GravisLizard made this rather long but really nice writeup on his experience with ADHD.&lt;/a&gt; In it he describes having severe memory issues and incredible difficulty planning tasks, which I don't have. In his example with the phone setup, I'm fairly confident I could just stick with a task and do that until it's done, even if it takes me a little while to decide which one to start with. He can't. And more generally, when I'm at work I can almost always can get my tasks for the day done, while he struggles a lot more with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question isn't who has it worse. It's who has it &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. People without ADHD &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have issues sustaining attention or avoiding difficult tasks or getting distracted or zoning out or missing deadlines like I do. Yes, most people do all of those things to some degree. But &lt;strong&gt;I believe the severity and consequences of my issues are beyond what I should have to deal with without help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I largely wrote this article not to complain about how my own brain is a steaming pile of garbage, but to get &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to consider thinking about issues you may have through a lens you may not have considered yet. &lt;strong&gt;If &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; I've written here resonates with you, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; look into this some more.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you don't feel that you are strongly affected by ADHD, or that what you're dealing with isn't a big deal, &lt;strong&gt;if you think having someone help you with your problems would be good, there is no shame in asking a professional.&lt;/strong&gt; Your problems matter. &lt;em&gt;You matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I realize that not everyone is in the position to seek a professional for help, or to get effective treatment in a timely manner. In the meantime, I'll at least share some tips and tricks for trying to focus on things that I've found at least somewhat helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start stuff ahead of time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Calendar, with first day marked with &amp;quot;30 minutes&amp;quot;, next two marked with &amp;quot;60 minutes&amp;quot;, next with &amp;quot;30 minutes&amp;quot; again, and last with &amp;quot;Due!&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/calendar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that this is really hard to do, but &lt;strong&gt;please try and give yourself a few day's buffer room to complete a task.&lt;/strong&gt; If on the first day you find that you absolutely &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; do it, get as much done as you can and postpone the rest until the next day. However, if you can get it done, then it's done ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the extra time to &lt;strong&gt;break up your tasks into smaller chunks.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't think of it as &quot;the whole task needs to be finished by Friday&quot;. Think of it like &quot;The first part is due on Monday, the second on Tuesday, etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use calendars and notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz writing on a whiteboard&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/write_it_down.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are told that you need to complete a certain task on a certain date, &lt;em&gt;write it down&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to do chores on a regular basis, &lt;em&gt;write them down in your calendar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you come up with a question that you're curious about but don't have the time to answer (like my solar panel example), &lt;em&gt;write it down and come back later&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to get homework done early, &lt;em&gt;schedule some time to work on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In short, &lt;strong&gt;if you're not going to take action on something right away, write it down&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One useful tool for this is the bullet journal. I'm not referring to the super intricate art projects you'll find on Pinterest and the like, but the original notes-in-a-notebook bullet journal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn&quot;&gt;There's a quick primer on it here&lt;/a&gt;, but the jist of it is that you write down the things you want to remember, and then you look back on them later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bujo/&quot;&gt;/r/bujo&lt;/a&gt; is a nice discussion board for these practical types of bullet journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use distractions wisely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz jammin' to some tunes while working&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/jammin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember earlier how I remarked how odd it was that I craved stimulation during hyperfocus? That's true! &lt;strong&gt;People with ADHD inherently need more stimulation than people without&lt;/strong&gt;, even when something has their attention. (In fact the primary medications used to treat people with ADHD &lt;em&gt;are stimulants&lt;/em&gt; for this exact reason!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you choose your distractions wisely, they can leave you stimulated enough without being taking away your focus.&lt;/strong&gt; I pretty much cannot work without some sort of music to keep me engaged. Sometimes I find that podcasts or creative livestreams are helpful, something that I don't have to pay super close attention to but can still tune in and out of, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://farlandsorbust.com/&quot;&gt;Far Lands or Bust&lt;/a&gt; series where Kurt just talks about whatever's on his mind, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks&quot;&gt;TED talks&lt;/a&gt;, or if you're a nerd like me PyCon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos&quot;&gt;CppCon&lt;/a&gt; talks. A friend of mine made &lt;a href=&quot;http://spriteclad.com/podcasts.html&quot;&gt;a big list of podcasts here to choose from&lt;/a&gt; too. (Be careful that you don't choose something &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; engaging, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you find you're physically restless, consider some fidget toys.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, fidget spinners were the great meme of 2017 and the idea of fidget toys has a bit of a stigma around them as a result. However, they and other fidgeting devices are designed keep yourself physically engaged while your mind churns away. I won't pretend to be an expert in these, as the closest thing I've got is a really squishy cube I keep on my desk. But I do find the contained distraction useful, especially when I'm reading something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't go alone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Viz is studying with a friend. The friend asks a question, and Viz excitedly responds.&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/friend.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that you are absolutely struggling with something, whether that be getting motivated to work on something or planning out how to work through a problem, &lt;strong&gt;there's no shame in asking a friend to keep you on track&lt;/strong&gt;. I find that I work a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; better in a team than I do alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're able, if you can get someone who can mentor you or assist you, that's good too. This is especially true for college students, because your college has resources that you're supposed to use. I've also found that having someone to bounce ideas off of helps me understand the material better than I ever could alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't overwork yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Probably just a schedule with waaaaay too much on it. Either that or Viz failing to juggle everything.&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/overwork.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last semester I had 3 classes, a research project, and a job. This was too much, in retrospect. I could not handle that. I should have instead cut back on the responsibilities I had to handle, so I would have had more mental energy to throw at the things that matter, like homework or studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does slightly sting that I can't do as much in a week as some other people, but I figure that &lt;strong&gt;doing some things decently is better than doing many things poorly.&lt;/strong&gt; If you find yourself struggling at a job, maybe consider cutting back on hours if it's economically feasible, at least for a week or two to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, &lt;strong&gt;don't &lt;em&gt;overpromise&lt;/em&gt; either&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm pretty bad at this, but I am learning that if I can barely handle my own responsibilities, I should not feel obligated to promise anything else on top of that. &lt;strong&gt;Fight the urge to say &quot;Yeah, I can do that&quot; unless you plan on doing that &lt;em&gt;very soon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise you might lose interest in it, and then it'll be another chore you have to force yourself to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know when to fold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A bunch of hobby bags shoved in a back room&quot; src=&quot;https://invisibleup.com/articles/27/hobbies_drop.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly stealing this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://redd.it/be7yho&quot;&gt;this /r/ADHD post&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the fact of the matter is that your hyperfixations will end &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt;. Don't beat yourself up when it does. &lt;strong&gt;Choose hobbies that you can start and stop with little pressure or financial loss,&lt;/strong&gt; like writing, drawing, playing an instrument, or computer programming. Your wallet will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article starting from the procrastination angle because I was specifically trying to play up what &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html&quot;&gt;Tim Urban's &quot;Why Procrastinators Procrastinate&quot;&lt;/a&gt; made me think about myself when I first read it in early high school. &lt;strong&gt;I resonated with a lot of the things that he described,&lt;/strong&gt; and the analogy of the monkey and the panic monster and the dark playground and all made a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is that I don't think that Tim realized that he was describing executive dysfunction, like I now strongly believe he was. He had me thinking that I was just &quot;a procrastinator&quot;, and that my problems were problems everyone had. Turns out, they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice he gives in his second part is inadequate, boiling down to &quot;break it down into chunks, set up Panic Monsters, and just &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Unfortunately, this mindset has caused me to rely on dangerous and stressful methods of getting stuff done. &lt;strong&gt;If I had instead sought out proper help, I would have had much better coping mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; for dealing with the problems ADHD gives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are &quot;a procrastinator&quot;, it may be for reasons outside of your control, and &lt;em&gt;that's okay&lt;/em&gt;. If you need medication or therapy to be able to do the things you want to do, &lt;em&gt;that's okay&lt;/em&gt;. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I again stress, &lt;strong&gt;if you feel that either you or someone you know relates to this article, please seek some help from a medical professional.&lt;/strong&gt; They can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made an attempt to make this article as accessible as possible for people with short attention spans or difficulty reading long articles. It's split into many sections, the paragraphs are short, the most important parts are in bold, and I drew plenty of illustrations. It should also be accessible to screen readers and Firefox's Reader Mode. I hope this effort has been helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading this. I sincerely hope this helps someone out there become the best them that they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these were linked in the article, but if you're interested in reading more here's some good resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other's Experiences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explanations of Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coping Mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this list is rather empty, because I'm still working on this myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Newspaper and Magazine Articles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that some of the historical articles (pre-2000) may have incorrect information. Read with care. I've also included a couple of modern articles that I liked. Everything here is sorted by chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Design Tips for Developers</title>
<link>https://paul.copplest.one/blog/design.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://paul.copplest.one/blog/design.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Developers aren't well-known for their design skills. I suspect that poor design/UX in open source projects is the primary reason they aren't more successful. Usually the projects are technically brilliant - fast, well tested, and well maintained. But without a loveable interface users won't get hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're the type of developer who is put off by any blog post with &quot;Design&quot; in the title. If you are, then I will say this up-front: design is about doing less rather than doing more. I don't advocate over-design, and I recommend erring on the side of simplicity. This blog post will only elaborate this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with anything, being &quot;20% good&quot; at design will get you 80% of the way there. This article outlines some of the tools and tips I have picked up over the years that will make you a &quot;20%&quot; designer. I'm not going to go into UX (even though it's more important) because I think learning how to think in simple design patterns is the baseline for creating usable products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-design-y-sense&quot;&gt; Building a design-y sense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step isn't necessary but it's the thing that gave me the most improvement for the least effort. It will improve your &quot;design sense&quot;, and give you an idea of your personal design style. The steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt; (I have no affiliation) and sign up for their weekly newsletter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you receive the weekly newsletter, click the &quot;Most Popular Shots&quot; link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse through the first page of the most popular shots for that week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Favourite&quot; any that you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes about 5 minutes each week. After a few weeks you can go back and look at your favourites. You'll likely find a theme in your favourites - perhaps the same color, or you like angles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll also notice the up-and-coming trends. In the past it was soft shadows and sharp angles. The current trend is illustrations of people. Start feeding these trends into your projects. Even if you aren't a big fan of them, it's good to remember that design is effective when it appeals to your target audience and not yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-logo&quot;&gt; Creating a logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logos are a great place to start since the logo design carries over to your software/site. Logos vary for different mediums (print, digital, etc), but since you're reading I'll assume you're a developer, and so your logo will be used on a website, on an app, or in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this describes your use-case it means your logo should consist of two parts, and should follow a few basic patterns. You should start with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logo text/name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-an-icon&quot;&gt; Designing an Icon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some useful guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Square&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure it fits evenly into a square. This is important because it will be in a &lt;code&gt;favicon&lt;/code&gt; or possibly an app icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symetrical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By symetrical, I mean that it should take up an even amount of space within the square. Logos can look a bit awkward when they are squashed to one side or if there is lots of space in one area of the square.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is by far the most important rule. There is no such thing as an icon which is too simple. Make sure it is legible when scaled down to 32x32 px. This is how it will look in the tab of a browser. Also keep the colors simple - you can use color, but it's best if you stick with just one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-the-logo-text-name&quot;&gt; Designing the logo text/name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a bit more freedom with this one. I would recommend, however, that you make this just a simple color - for example, black or dark grey. Let the icon carry the logo, and let font that you choose for the text set the brand. Whichever font you choose for the text, you should (probably) use it in all the headings of your site/app/software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt; Colors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice I can give for colors is to choose one which is vibrant and that's all. Every other color should be white or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that I have got that out of the way, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use other colors (for things like alerts, warnings, etc), and a few different grey tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm building a tech product, I usually begin my designs with what I call &quot;startup blue&quot;. You've probably seen this color on a million different tech sites. The hex code for startup blue is somewhere close to&lt;span&gt;#2B70F6&lt;/span&gt;. There are lots of reasons for this, but none more important than it's safe. After you have created your site, feel free to play with this color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everything you need to know about colors, I highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Building your color pallete&lt;/a&gt; by Refactoring UI. After you have a good grasp on the concepts, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorbox.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;colorbox.io&lt;/a&gt; to build your custom pallete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fonts&quot;&gt; Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started it's good to know that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;this is sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;this is serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;this is monospace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three guidelines I could give here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for only one or two different fonts, three if you &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sans-serif is safest for headings and the font should (probably) be bold, symmetrical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content can be serif but it's fine to be san-serif. Serif fonts are ostensibly easier to read for long paragraphs because the little &quot;tails&quot; on the letters make it easier on the eyes, but this is more true in printed media than on pixilated screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the logo section, you (probably) want your heading font to match your logo font, but it's not critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonts are something that you have to play with a lot to find something you like. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt; is useful here (if you don't have an aversion to Google) since you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading/uploading the font to try it out. I'm personally trying to move away from Google so I'm slowly &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickfont.xyz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;building up a site&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the same thing, except the fonts are served from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;icons&quot;&gt; Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to use only a few icons. Icons actually add very little, practically speaking, unless you are able to replace some words completely with the icon. A great example is the ≡ 'hamburger icon' which completely replaces the need to have &quot;Show menu&quot; in navbars. Quite honestly, I think even &quot;good&quot; designers use too many icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a few icons can make a site look more finished. Just make sure the icons have a consistent &quot;theme&quot;: they should have the same stroke thickness; if some are rounded, they should all be rounded; keep the colors consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, simplify! The point of an icon is to reduce the cognitive load on a user. Try to stick with icons that have very little detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the best (free) resources that I commonly use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;images-and-illustrations&quot;&gt; Images and Illustrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images and illustrations largely serve the purpose of filling space and emphasizing your message. Which one you choose is a matter of preference, but try not to mix the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;illustrations&quot;&gt; Illustrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrations can really bring a website/app to life. They are less important in software (in fact they would probably look stupid in most software) but work well on landing pages. However illustrations are the hardest to nail, because they are hard quite bespoke which makes it difficult to have a consistent look across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to create your site first without illustrations (I doubt this will be a problem for most readers), then as a final step add a few illustrations if you have gaps to fill. There are some really great resources starting to pop up which have some free, lightweight illustrations to try. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt; Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images are much easier than illustrations because the quantity of stock photos is so much larger than stock illustrations, and if you want to move the designs in-house in the future then it's far easier to find a competent photographer than a competent illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, images are far more effective on websites than software (which probably goes without saying, but I'm staying it anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to make images feel &quot;part&quot; of the site - quite often they just seem like they are floating in place. It just takes some small things to mitigate this. For example, you can make your images stretch full-width. Or if your site uses lots of rounded corners, add rounded corners to your floating images. If your site uses drop-shadows, add them to your images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding text onto images is a little bit risky since it can make the text hard to read. If you are going to do this, add a very subtle drop shadow to the text. Alternatively you can consider adding an overlay between the text and the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best sites I use for images are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;branding&quot;&gt; Branding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is the only thing you need to remember here. For a product to feel cohesive, it must be consistent. Some guidelines are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose one color and use it everywhere. For everything else use black or dark grey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose one font and use it everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text sizes should always be the same (with the exception of headers). Don't make one paragraph 12px and another 14px&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use consistent padding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make things line up. When we see things for the first time, it's easier to make sense of fewer &quot;blocks&quot; of things. We can achieve this by grouping things together and aligning them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't fall into the trap of &quot;redesigning sections&quot;. When you start designing it feels like every part of your site should look slightly different. In fact the opposite is true. Try to use the same layouts everywhere. When a person sees a something for the first time their brain has to make sense of everything they are seeing. There is a cognitive load while they determine what is the important information, and this is mentally an uncomfortable process. If you can reuse the same layouts throughout your site then your users' cognitive load is lessened, and they only have to feel uncomfortable once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-a-css-framework&quot;&gt; Using a CSS framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're building a website, I highly recommend keeping your CSS framework and JS framework separate. Wherever possible avoid using &quot;locked in&quot; frameworks like ReactStrap, and instead opt for &quot;class based&quot; CSS frameworks. Once you become comfortable with this then your designs can be implemented anywhere - whether you use HTML, React, Vue, or whatever latest and greatest framework you decide to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend sticking with a &quot;utility-first&quot; CSS framework. Take your pick of either &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulma.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bulma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; and invest a day into learning how they work. This day will pay off in spades - prototyping with either of these is quicker than designing then implementing from scratch. Avoid ever using the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag. Just use classes for everything from layout to look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; . That's all you really need. Forget about Sketch and Invision. Figma has vector design capabilities, clickable prototypes, commenting, and it's collaborative. And it's free(mium)! Invest a little bit of time into using it - video tutorials are quite helpful here - and then live inside it for anything that you need to do for design and editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really a fan-boy of Figma, but for good reason. I've tried a lot of other tools in the past and none are as good (and holistic). If you're working with photos then you may also need Photoshop but as a developer the types of things that you need to do with photos are usually just compressing and resizing, which can be better achieved with an asset pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/landing-pages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Julian Landing page&lt;/a&gt; : This is the best guide I know for building a landing page. One additional tip: if you are using a Hero on your landing page, make it only &lt;code&gt;70vh&lt;/code&gt; and have a &quot;More&quot; button below it. Too many websites have a &lt;code&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt; hero, and it isn't immediately apparent to the user that they can scroll down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Design Tools for Everything&lt;/a&gt; : A huge list of tools. I personally find these lists a bit daunting but it does have something for everybody if you can be bothered combing through it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may occasionally want to implement some CSS layouts outside of the grid systems provided by Bulma or Tailwind. A couple of resources for learning are &lt;a href=&quot;https://testdriven.io/blog/css-grid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;testdriven.io/blog/css-grid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://every-layout.dev&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;every-layout.dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An awesome resource for creating printable UI mockups/wireframes templates: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexadam/printable-mockups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;github.com/alexadam/printable-mockups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Microsoft to force Chrome default search to Bing via Office365 ProPlus installer</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077280/microsoft-chrome-bing-extension-office-365-proplus-installer-default-search-engine</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077280/microsoft-chrome-bing-extension-office-365-proplus-installer-default-search-engine</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;lTK0xm&quot;&gt;Microsoft is planning to use the Office 365 installer to forcibly switch Chrome users over to the company’s Bing search engine. Microsoft’s Office 365 ProPlus installer, used by businesses, will include a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-search-in-bing/obdappnhkfoejojnmcohppfnoeagadna&quot;&gt;new Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; next month that switches the default search engine to Bing. New installations of Office 365 ProPlus and updated installs will include the extension, as long as the default search engine in Chrome is not set to Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VuGBlA&quot;&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/microsoft-search-bing&quot;&gt;clearly marketing this to IT admins&lt;/a&gt; as enabling its Microsoft Search functionality in Chrome, but it also looks like a stealthy way of pushing people over to using Bing. If Bing is already set as the default search engine in Chrome, then the extension never gets installed. Microsoft is planning to roll this out in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and India next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Cj05gk&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-forcibly-install-bing-search-extension-in-chrome-for-office-365-proplus-users/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that IT admins aren’t very happy with the move. A popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/es6xp5/office_365_proplus_to_change_chromes_default/&quot;&gt;thread on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; has surfaced, and most admins want this to be optional. Thankfully, admins will be able to block the Chrome extension install through Group Policy, and users will be able to remove it after it has been installed. Office users will also be able to disable Bing as the default search engine through the extension’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
