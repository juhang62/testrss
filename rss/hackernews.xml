<title>Brexit Deal Fails in Parliament</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday suffered a humiliating defeat over her plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union, thrusting the country further into political chaos with only 10 weeks to go until it is scheduled to leave the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The 432-to-202 vote to reject her plan was the biggest defeat in the House of Commons for a prime minister in recent British history, and it underscores how under Ms. May the prime minister’s office has lost ground in shaping important policy. Now factions in Parliament will seek to seize the initiative, an unpredictable new stage in the process of withdrawing from Europe, known as Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“She has completely lost control of the process, and her version of Brexit must now be dead, if she loses by 230 votes,” said John Springford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Immediately following the vote, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, citing the “sheer incompetence of this government,” announced that he was offering a motion of no confidence, which will be heard on Wednesday. That could in theory lead to a general election, but few analysts believe he can muster the necessary votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Indeed, just after Mr. Corbyn’s announcement, both Mrs. May’s coalition partner, the Democratic Unionist Party, and the European Research Group, an alliance of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, said they would support the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The reaction in Brussels was muted and watchful, but the theme was clear: Tell us, at last, what you really really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Theresa May called the vote “a historic decision that will set the future of our country for generations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jessica Taylor/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1085260488903090176&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JunckerEU/status/1085263377411145728&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: “I urge the U.K. to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before the vote, lawmakers in both the Conservative and Labour parties were being urged to put country before party to resolve the stalemate. Yet the problem remains that, even if they did, there is no clear path forward that can command a majority in the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In her final appeal in Parliament, Mrs. May impressed on the lawmakers the importance of the vote facing them. “The responsibility on each and every one of us at this moment is profound,” she said, “for this is a historic decision that will set the future of our country for generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like most others, though, the prime minister has no easy answers about the way forward. She has signaled that she will appeal to the European Union in Brussels for concessions and try again to win parliamentary approval, but the bloc is unlikely to grant her any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the thumping in Parliament, Mrs. May did accede to a tactic that some cabinet members had been urging, calling for nonbinding &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/7e5817c0-02be-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“indicative votes”&lt;/a&gt; that will allow members of Parliament to freely express their preferences for the various Brexit plans being bandied about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Springford of the Center for European Reform said that process raised the possibility that if Parliament coalesced around a clear proposal for the future Mrs. May could try to negotiate such a result with the European Union. To win support from the Labour Party, it would mean accepting a “softer” Brexit that would keep closer economic ties to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1ias84j&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1nbz89a e6u6ph30&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/us/may-brexit-vote-fail-promo-1547553465820/may-brexit-vote-fail-promo-1547553465820-articleLarge.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1rha1bf&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-zd32qr e6u6ph31&quot;&gt;May’s Brexit Deal Just Failed. What Happens Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1uuihdo&quot;&gt;Nobody knows, really. But these are the likeliest scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;time class=&quot;css-1j5weju e16638kd0&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-01-15&quot;&gt;Jan. 15, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Corbyn would then be on the spot, forced to decide whether to work with Mrs. May on Brexit or bow to pressure from within his party for a second referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think it’s now between a softer Brexit and a second referendum,” said Mr. Springford, who added that he did not believe the government could pursue a no-deal result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Negotiating the withdrawal from the European Union has been Mrs. May’s singular focus since she became prime minister, displacing social problems like housing and health care. But her failure to build consensus behind a single vision of Britain’s future outside the 28-nation bloc has allowed painful divides in the country to deepen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With no consensus behind any one pathway, and a vanishing window for further negotiation, more radical solutions are rising to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One group of lawmakers is campaigning for a repeat referendum, which could overturn the mandate to leave, and another favors leaving the European Union on March 29 without a withdrawal agreement, a move that experts warn could lead to shortages of some foods and an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is probably the most important piece of legislation for decades, and the executive can’t get it through,” said Tim Stanley, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph. “It’s a very dramatic moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mrs. May expected to lose the vote, having lost the support of many of her own lawmakers. But her surrogates scrambled, as late as Tuesday, to rally lawmakers to her side, in hopes of keeping the margin narrow enough to try again for parliamentary approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;After Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan was soundly rejected by Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour party, tabled a motion of no confidence. The motion will be heard on Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Published On&lt;/span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-01-15&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u eqalrg90&quot;&gt;Jan. 15, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;emkp2hg2 css-11qqavp e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Duffy/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Earlier in the day, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, raked his eyes over the backbenches of the House of Commons and rebuked Parliament, in a booming voice, for contemplating a sudden and unregulated end to 45 years of integration with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Beseeching his fellow Tories to get behind Mrs. May’s plan, Mr. Cox asked: “What are you playing at? What are you doing? You are not children in the playground. You are legislators, and it is your job. We are playing with people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He continued, rolling his Rs in theatrical fashion, “Do we opt for order? Or do we choose chaos?” The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was equally dramatic in a morning radio interview, warning lawmakers that “if we don’t vote for this deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, winter is coming,” a reference to “Game of Thrones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But critics of the deal were equally adamant, saying that Mrs. May had emerged from two years of negotiations with an agreement that satisfied no one. Dominic Raab, who stepped down as Mrs. May’s Brexit secretary in November, described her agreement as “wracked with self-doubt, defeatism and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This deal before us can’t end the grinding process — it can only prolong it,” Mr. Raab said. “It would torment us and our European neighbors for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Under normal circumstances, a British prime minister would be expected to resign after losing a vote on their flagship policy, but the Brexit process has so unsettled political conventions that Mrs. May could survive to make revisions and pitch her deal again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In December, Mrs. May &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/world/europe/theresa-may-no-confidence-vote.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;survived a leadership challenge&lt;/a&gt; from within her own Conservative Party and, under its rules, is safe from another until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Watching the Brexit vote at a pub in London.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have been in extraordinary circumstances,” said Nikki da Costa, a former director of legal affairs at 10 Downing Street. “Things that in normal times would not be considered survivable have become normalized. What the government would be looking for is a pathway through this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Da Costa predicted that “we will be doing this again in a couple of weeks’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, Tuesday’s vote represented a clear rejection of Mrs. May’s handling of Brexit and a failure of her gamble that Parliament would ultimately accept her deal for fear of something worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Philip Cowley, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said he was struggling to identify a comparable defeat in the history of British politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“When you ask me for a historical benchmark, I can’t find any example. I don’t think anything like it has come along,” Mr. Cowley said. “It’s an issue which has caused the parties to have split on an almost theological level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mrs. May will now face pressure to allow Parliament to vote on options other than her Brexit plan, a fuzzy middle way that keeps different economic possibilities open for the future but also restores the power to the government in London over immigration from the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Alternatives include proposals to adhere more closely to the European Union’s economic rule book, by remaining in a customs union with the bloc, or going further and staying within its single market. But that would involve obeying more European rules, abandoning the idea of conducting an independent trade policy, and possibly allowing the free movement of European workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most members of Parliament oppose the prospect of leaving the union without a deal on March 29, a disorderly and chaotic rupture that would do significant economic damage, so they may press for an extension of the negotiating period. European officials will be reluctant to grant that without any clear new strategy from the government, but they too want to avoid a “no deal” Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>California’s Monarch Butterfly Population Hits Record Low</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/science/monarch-butterfly-california.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/science/monarch-butterfly-california.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They arrive in California each winter, an undulating ribbon of orange and black. There, migrating western monarch butterflies nestle among the state’s coastal forests, traveling from as far away as Idaho and Utah only to return home in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This year, though, the monarchs’ flight seems more perilous than ever. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, a nonprofit group that conducts a yearly census of the western monarch, said the population reached historic lows in 2018, an estimated 86 percent decline from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That in itself would be troubling news. But, combined with a 97 percent decline in the total population since the 1980s, this year’s count is “potentially catastrophic,” according to the biologist Emma Pelton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We think this is a huge wake-up call,” said Ms. Pelton, who oversees the survey and lives in Portland, Ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The society has preliminary counts from 97 sites, most of them along California’s coast, representing an area that traditionally accounts for nearly 77 percent of the state’s winter monarch population. In 2017, the sites hosted about 148,000 monarchs. But in 2018, that dropped to an estimated 20,456 monarchs, with large numbers of them counted in Pismo Beach, Big Sur and Pacific Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In November volunteers fan out across California’s coastal cities to find and count the monarch population. Ms. Pelton said the total count could be higher once final numbers from the census arrive next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Monarchs in the western part of the United States migrate for the winter to California, where they gather mostly among fragrant eucalyptus trees, which provide hospitable living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Monarchs from the eastern part of the United States, by contrast, winter in Mexico. Ms. Pelton said the count of eastern monarchs had not been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Pelton warns that if nothing is done to preserve the western monarchs and their habitat, the butterflies could face extinction. In a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://xerces.org/2017/09/08/monarch-butterflies-disappearing-from-western-north-america/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, scientists estimated that the monarch butterfly population in western North America had a 72 percent chance of becoming near extinct in 20 years if the monarch population trend was not reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One of the study’s researchers, Cheryl Schultz, an associate professor at Washington State University Vancouver, said at the time that an estimated 10 million monarchs spent the winter in coastal California in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Butterflies are important because they quickly respond to ecological changes and serve as a warning about an ecosystem’s health, Ms. Pelton said. They pollinate flowers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Monarchs require &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;amp;v=q15DioqeAe0&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;milkweed&lt;/a&gt;, a herbaceous plant that grows throughout the United States and Mexico, for breeding and migration. Acreage of milkweed, though, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140819-monarch-butterfly-milkweed-environment-ecology-science/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has been declining&lt;/a&gt; in recent years because of pesticide use and urban development, Ms. Pelton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“A lawn does not provide a home for a butterfly,” she said. “It doesn’t help to raise them in your house, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Harsher than usual weather, too, has threatened the monarch’s existence. From 2011 to 2017, California had one of its worst droughts on record, which led to ecological devastation among fishing communities and forested towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2016, for example, the United States Forest Service &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fs.fed.us/news/releases/new-aerial-survey-identifies-more-100-million-dead-trees-california&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;estimated that 62 million trees died&lt;/a&gt; in the state. Last year the state experienced the deadliest wildfire season in its history, with residents affected from Redding to Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Pelton said the trend could reverse if citizens and governments act now. Gardeners, for one, can plant milkweed to support the surviving monarchs. And towns could help local habitats thrive by planting new trees now so that in 20 years, generations of monarchs have new places to winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t think it is too late to act,” she said. “But everyone needs to step up their effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Pwn2Own Vancouver 2019: Tesla, VMWare, Microsoft, and more</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2019/1/14/pwn2own-vancouver-2019-tesla-vmware-microsoft-and-more</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2019/1/14/pwn2own-vancouver-2019-tesla-vmware-microsoft-and-more</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2007, Pwn2Own has evolved from a small demonstration with prizes averaging around $10,000 per exploit, to one of the most well-known security contests in the industry, with millions of dollars of cash and prizes made available to contestants over the years. The contest serves as more than just an annual check-in on the state of browser and OS security. It also guides researchers as we add new categories and increase cash awards. Over the years, new veins of security research were mined after being a target of Pwn2Own. We saw that with exploit techniques like sandbox escapes, mitigation bypasses, and guest-to-host OS escalations. This year, on March 20-22 at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cansecwest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CanSecWest&lt;/a&gt; conference, we hope to see that research expand into our newest category, Automotive with the addition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/model3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla Model 3&lt;/a&gt;, which has quickly become the best-selling car in its class in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. We’ll have a &lt;strong&gt;Tesla&lt;/strong&gt; Model 3 on-site as a target for our automotive category, which has six different focal points for in-scope research (details below). Tesla essentially pioneered the concept of the connected car with their Model S sedan, and in partnership with Tesla, we hope to encourage even more security research into connected vehicles as the category continues to expand. Prizes range from $35,000 to $300,000 depending on a variety of factors including the exploit used. And the first successful researcher can also drive off in their own brand new Model 3 after the competition ends. See the rules section below for specific target categories and awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars aren’t the only thing providing a big payout this year. &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; returns as a partner for 2019 and leads the virtualization category with a $250,000 award for a successful Hyper-V Client guest-to-host escalation. With that much cash, you can get your own Model 3 – or a few in multiple colors. &lt;strong&gt;VMware&lt;/strong&gt; also returns as a Pwn2Own sponsor for 2019, and this year, we’ll have VMware ESXi alongside VMware Workstation as a target with awards of $150,000 and $70,000 respectively. Oracle VirtualBox rounds out this category with a prize of $35,000. Cloud computing relies on virtualization, as do many other critical computing functions. We’ve seen guest-to-host OS escalations in the past two Pwn2Own contests. Here’s hoping we see more this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browsers are a traditional target for Pwn2Own Vancouver, and that remains the case for 2019. With the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft moving to a Chromium-based engine, exploits on Google Chrome definitely earn a premium over Edge, Safari, and Firefox. A browser exploit ranges from $40,000 for Firefox up to $80,000 for Chrome. We’re also offering $80,000 for anyone who can successfully exploit Edge with a Windows Defender Application Guard (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WDAG&lt;/a&gt;) specific escape from the WDAG container to the host OS – something we’ve never seen at Pwn2Own before. Contestants can add on another $70,000 if they escape the virtual machine and execute code on the host OS. Some say the browser is the gateway to the cloud. It’s certainly the gateway to online shopping. Either way, bugs in these products have a broad impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise applications also return as targets with Adobe Reader and various Office components, including Outlook, on the docket. Prizes in this category run from $40,000 for a Reader exploit, $60,000 for a successful Office entry, and $100,000 for Outlook. There’s a better than average chance that you use one (or more) of these applications in your average work day, making this category relevant to nearly everyone with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Server Side category is much smaller this year with Microsoft Windows RDP as the only target. Most of our server side targets moved to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2018/11/7/updates-and-new-targets-available-in-the-targeted-incentive-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Targeted Incentive Program&lt;/a&gt;, so they no longer need to be included in Pwn2Own. Still, a successful RDP exploit will garner $150,000 for the contestant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, no Pwn2Own would be complete without crowning the Master of Pwn. Since the order of the contest is decided by a random draw, contestants with an unlucky draw could present great research, but receive less money since subsequent rounds go down in value. However, the points awarded for each successful entry do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go down. Someone could have a bad draw and still accumulate the most points. The person or team with the most points at the end of the contest will be crowned Master of Pwn, receive 65,000 ZDI reward points (instant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt; status), a killer &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5894c269e4fcb5e65a1ed623/t/5b8993b321c67c67b886f506/1535742910114/trophy.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trophy&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6Z5iQQXEAEPQ0Q.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNhpw_xUEAEkEwG.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;snazzy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu-6uFSWcAEefBS.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jacket&lt;/a&gt; to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU Copyright Directive is a catastrophe for free expression and competition</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Monday 14th 2019: We've added contact details and &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/belgium-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;an action for Belgium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/belgium-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Belgium: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new EU Copyright Directive is progressing at an alarming rate. This week, the EU is asking its member-states to approve new negotiating positions for the final language. Once they get it, they're planning to hold a final vote before pushing this drastic, radical new law into 28 countries and 500,000,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of the rules in the new Directive are inoffensive updates to European copyright law, two parts of the Directive represent pose a dire threat to the global Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Article 11: A proposal to make platforms pay for linking to news sites by creating a non-waivable right to license any links from for-profit services (where those links include more than a word or two from the story or its headline). Article 11 fails to define “news sites,” “commercial platforms” and “links,” which invites 28 European nations to create 28 mutually exclusive, contradictory licensing regimes. Additionally, the fact that the “linking right” can’t be waived means that open-access, public-interest, nonprofit and Creative Commons news sites can’t opt out of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 13: A proposal to end the appearance of unlicensed copyrighted works on big user-generated content platforms, even for an instant. Initially, this included an explicit mandate to develop “filters” that would examine every social media posting by everyone in the world and check whether it matched entries in an open, crowdsourced database of supposedly copyrighted materials. In its current form, the rule says that filters “should be avoided” but does not explain how billions of social media posts, videos, audio files, and blog posts should be monitored for infringement without automated filtering systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these two rules will subject huge swaths of online expression to interception and arbitrary censorship, and give the largest news companies in Europe the power to decide who can discuss and criticise their reporting, and undermining public-interest, open-access journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Directive is now in the hands of the European member-states. National ministers are going to decide whether or not Europe becomes a global exporter of censorship and surveillance. Your voice &lt;em&gt;counts&lt;/em&gt;: when you contact your ministers, you are speaking as one citizen to another, in a national context, about issues of import to you and your neighbours. Your national government depends on your goodwill to win the votes to continue its mandate. This is a rare moment in European lawmaking when local connections from citizens matter more than well-funded, international corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you live in Sweden, Germany, Luxembourg, or Poland:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contact your ministers to convey your concern about Article 13 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up action pages to reach the right people, but you should tailor your message to describe who you are, and your worries. Your country has previously expressed concerns about Article 13 and 11, and may still oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/sweden-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Sweden: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/germany-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Germany: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/luxembourg-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Luxembourg: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/poland-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Poland: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/belgium-help-save-the-internet-from-the-copyright-directive&quot;&gt;Belgium: Take Action Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you live in the rest of Europe: please contact the ministers working on the Copyright in the Digital Single Market directive. We'll update this page with more information as we get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Record Layer is a Java API providing a record-oriented store on top of FoundationDB, (very) roughly equivalent to a simple relational database, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured types&lt;/strong&gt; - Records are defined and stored in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;protobuf&lt;/a&gt; messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indexes&lt;/strong&gt; - The Record Layer supports a variety of different index types including value indexes (the kind provided by most databases), rank indexes, and aggregate indexes. Indexes and primary keys can be defined either via protobuf options or programatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex types&lt;/strong&gt; - Support for complex types, such as lists and nested records, including the ability to define indexes against such nested structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queries&lt;/strong&gt; - The Record Layer does not provide a query language, however it provides query APIs with the ability to scan, filter, and sort across one or more record types, and a query planner capable of automatic selection of indexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many record stores, shared schema&lt;/strong&gt; - The Record Layer provides the the ability to support many discrete record store instances, all with a shared (and evolving) schema. For example, rather than modeling a single database in which to store all user's data, each user can be given their own record store, perhaps sharded across different FDB cluster instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very light weight&lt;/strong&gt; - The Record layer is designed to be used in a large, distributed, stateless environment. The time between opening a store and the first query is intended to be measured in milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible&lt;/strong&gt; - New index types and custom index key expressions may be dynamically incorporated into a record store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Record Layer may be used directly or provides an excellent foundational layer on which more complex systems can be constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Insect collapse</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;“We knew that something was amiss in the first couple days,” said Brad Lister. “We were driving into the forest and at the same time both Andres and I said: ‘Where are all the birds?’ There was nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His return to the Luquillo rainforest in Puerto Rico after 35 years was to reveal an appalling discovery. The insect population that once provided plentiful food for birds throughout the mountainous national park had collapsed. On the ground, 98% had gone. Up in the leafy canopy, 80% had vanished. The most likely culprit by far is global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was just astonishing,” Lister said. “Before, both the sticky ground plates and canopy plates would be covered with insects. You’d be there for hours picking them off the plates at night. But now the plates would come down after 12 hours in the tropical forest with a couple of lonely insects trapped or none at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a true collapse of the insect populations in that rainforest,” he said. “We began to realise this is terrible – a very, very disturbing result.”&lt;/p&gt;

When Lister’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/E10397&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;study was published in October&lt;/a&gt;, one expert called the findings “hyper-alarming”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Puerto Rico work is one of just a handful of studies assessing this vital issue, but those that do exist are deeply worrying. Flying insect numbers in Germany’s natural reserves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;have plunged 75% in just 25 years&lt;/a&gt;. The virtual &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00578.x&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;disappearance of birds in an Australian eucalyptus forest&lt;/a&gt; was blamed on a lack of insects caused by drought and heat. Lister and his colleague Andrés García also found that insect numbers in a dry forest in Mexico had fallen 80% since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,” Lister said. “It is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not insects that drew Lister to the Luquillo rainforest for the first time in the mid-1970s. “I was interested in competition among the anoles lizards,” he said. “They’re the most diverse group of vertebrates in the world and even by that time had become a paradigm for ecology and evolutionary studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;La Mina river cascades over rocks in El Yunque national forest&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ed1a1bfe5bbd1c7dd8a6b0c89e7800065dd33d/0_0_2832_4256/master/2832.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=c9118fa6a758e76128de7f39f3d1f181&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest immediately captivated Lister, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the US. “It was and still is the most beautiful forest I have ever been in. It’s almost enchanted. There’s the lush verdant forest and cascading waterfalls, and along the roadsides there are carpets of multicoloured flowers. It’s a phantasmagoric landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was important to measure insect numbers, as these are the lizards’ main food, but at the time he thought nothing more of it. Returning to the national park decades later, however, the difference was startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things I noticed in the forest was a lack of butterflies,” he said. “They used to be all along the roadside, especially after the rain stopped, hundreds upon hundreds of them. But we couldn’t see one butterfly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Lister’s first visits to Luquillo, other scientists had predicted that tropical insects, having evolved in a very stable climate, would be much more sensitive to climate warming. “If you go a little bit past the thermal optimum for tropical insects, their fitness just plummets,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the data came in, the predictions were confirmed in startling fashion. “The number of hot spells, temperatures above 29C, have increased tremendously,” he said. “It went from zero in the 1970s up to something like 44% of the days.” Factors important elsewhere in the world, such as destruction of habitat and pesticide use, could not explain the plummeting insect populations in Luquillo, which has long been a protected area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on other animals that feed on bugs backed up the findings. “The frogs and birds had also declined simultaneously by about 50% to 65%,” Lister said. The population of one dazzling green bird that eats almost nothing but insects, the Puerto Rican tody, dropped by 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;A Puerto Rican tody&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db538cbce6f53db617100172cca20ee935b6c409/0_112_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebe35617f15696d77bac5cba66e51f98&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lister calls these impacts a “bottom-up trophic cascade”, in which the knock-on effects of the insect collapse surge up through the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think most people have a systems view of the natural world,” he said. “But it’s all connected and when the invertebrates are declining the entire food web is going to suffer and degrade. It is a system-wide effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the global scale of an insect collapse that has so far only been glimpsed, Lister says, there is an urgent need for much more research in many more habitats. “More data, that is my mantra,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there were very few studies of insect numbers in past decades to serve as a baseline, but Lister is undeterred: “There’s no time like the present to start asking what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
