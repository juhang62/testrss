<title>Hashicorp Vault v1.0</title>
<link>https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to announce the public availability of HashiCorp Vault 1.0. Vault is a tool to manage secrets and protect sensitive data for any infrastructure and application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 is focused on renovating Vault's infrastructure to support high performance, scalable workloads. The 1.0 release of Vault includes significant new functionality including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batch Tokens:&lt;/strong&gt; A new type of token optimized for high performance, ephemeral workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Cloud Auto Unseal:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud-based auto unseal is now open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAPI Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Vault now supports the OpenAPI standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Alibaba Cloud Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Expanded support for running Vault on Alibaba Cloud environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated UI:&lt;/strong&gt; Significant updates to the Vault UI for better ease of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCP Cloud KMS Secrets Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Manage GCP CKMS keys from within Vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release also includes additional new features, secure workflow enhancements, general improvements, and bug fixes. The Vault 1.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; provides a full list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 is a major milestone for the Vault team and HashiCorp as a whole. Vault is the fourth HashiCorp project to reach 1.0, and where we are today is the result of nearly four years of hard work between HashiCorp and the broader open source community. We are immensely grateful to the community for their contributions. As always, thank you for all of your pull requests, ideas, bug reports, and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;batch-tokens&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;batch-tokens&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#batch-tokens&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Batch Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch tokens are a new type of token that support ephemeral, high performance workloads. These tokens do not write to disk, significantly reducing the performance cost of any operation within Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trade off, batch tokens are not persistent and should not be used for any kind of long-lived or ongoing operation or any operation that requires resiliency of that token in the face of the failure or downtime of the Vault cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ephemeral nature of batch tokens makes them well suited for large batches of single-purpose operations such as use of the transit secret engine, but ill suited for operations such as persistent access for secrets within a K/V engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#open-source-cloud-auto-unseal&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Open Source Cloud Auto Unseal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vault 1.0, we are open sourcing Cloud Auto Unseal, allowing for all users of Vault to leverage cloud services such as AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and GCP CKMS to manage the unseal process for Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to open source Cloud Auto Unseal to simplify the process of storing and reassembling Shamir's keys for all users. While we originally thought cloud auto-unseal was just an enterprise compliance need, we've realized in working with the community that auto-unseal is more for ease of use than compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that HSM-based Auto Unseal (via the PKCS#11 standard) and Seal-Wrap will continue to remain features within Vault Enterprise. Both of these features are typically deployed to conform with government and regulatory compliance requirements, and thus are aligned with enterprise use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openapi&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;openapi&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#openapi&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; OpenAPI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 now supports the Open API Initiative's OpenAPI standard, joining a host of other major open source projects in providing a vendor-neutral description format for its API calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;/sys/internal/specs/openapi&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, Vault can generate an OpenAPI v3 document that describes mounted backends and endpoint capabilities for a given token's permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-ui&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;updated-ui&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#updated-ui&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Updated UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The releases leading up to 1.0 have seen significant updates to the Vault UI. These include wizards to help introduce new users to common Vault workflows for configuring Vault and storing secrets, updated screens for how users mount auth methods and secret engines, support for managing key versioning within the K/V v2 secrets engine, and a host of other updates to help ensure that Vault can almost completely be deployed, initialized, and managed from within the Vault UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.0 is the culmination of a very significant amount of work from the Vault UI team over the last few major releases. We will publish a deep dive highlighting the UI team's work, and Vault's ability to be configured and manage workflows graphically, in an upcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#expanded-alibaba-cloud-integration&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Expanded Alibaba Cloud Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 expands on features for operating Vault with and within Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba Cloud KMS is now supported as a Seal-Wrap and Auto Unseal target, and the Alibaba Cloud Auth Method is now a supported interface for Auto Auth within Vault Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#gcp-ckms-secret-engine&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; GCP CKMS Secret Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 sees the release of a new secrets engine for managing cryptographic operations within Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Key Management System. This interface allows for transit-like decrypt/encrypt operations, key creation, and key management within external GCP CKMS systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;other-features&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#other-features&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Other Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many new features in Vault 1.0 that have been developed over the course of the 0.11.x releases. We have summarized a few of the larger features below, and as always consult the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for full details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Secret Engine Root Credential Rotation:&lt;/strong&gt; The credential used by the AWS secret engine can now be rotated, to ensure that only Vault knows the credentials it is using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Backend Migrator:&lt;/strong&gt; A new operator migrate command allows offline migration of data between two storage backends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit Key Trimming:&lt;/strong&gt; Keys in transit secret engine can now be trimmed to remove older unused key versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication Speed Improvements (Vault Enterprise):&lt;/strong&gt; Vault's replication system has been overhauled to dramatically improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrade-details&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;upgrade-details&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-1-0#upgrade-details&quot;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vault 1.0 introduces significant new functionality. As such, we provide both general upgrade instructions and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/upgrading/upgrade-to-1.0.html&quot;&gt;Vault 1.0-specific upgrade page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues&quot;&gt;Vault GitHub issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; or post to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vault-tool&quot;&gt;Vault mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault&quot;&gt;https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault&lt;/a&gt;. Users can download the open source version of Vault at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaultproject.io/&quot;&gt;https://www.vaultproject.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy Vault 1.0!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112402&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-300x169.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-cover-768x432.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Samsung was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/samsung-busted-tweeting-stock-photos-to-promote-galaxy-a8-camera/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;busted for using stock photos&lt;/a&gt; to show off capabilities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0794JC2K5/diy0c-20&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Galaxy A8&lt;/a&gt;’s camera. And now they did it again – they used a stock image taken with a DSLR to fake the camera’s portrait mode. How do I know this, you may wonder? Well, it’s because Samsung used MY photo to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How I found out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, while I was trying to find a suitable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/still-using-flickr-struggling-leave/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;alternative for Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, I ended up creating a profile on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eyeem.com/u/dunja0712&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;EyeEm&lt;/a&gt;. Since they’re partnered with Getty, some of my images were selected to be sold through Getty’s collection. I totally forgot about it, until a few weeks ago when I got an email from EyeEm: &lt;em&gt;Congratulations, you sold a photo!&lt;/em&gt;  Awwww, I made my first sale on EyeEm! For some reason, someone bought this portrait of me goofing around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112399&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-745x493.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-745x493.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-300x199.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dunjadjudjic-natural-768x509.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious as I am, I performed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/four-ways-find-stolen-photos-online/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;reverse image search&lt;/a&gt; a few days later, just for fun. I thought that, even if I get to see the image online, it could be included in a blog post about outdoor activities, nature, autumn… Maybe even makeup. But to my surprise, there was only a bunch of search results related with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07F3RNKZL/diy0c-20&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Galaxy A8 Star&lt;/a&gt;. I clicked on the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/my/smartphones/galaxy-a8star-g885/SM-G885FZKDXME/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, scrolled down, and saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-112401&quot; src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-745x445.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-745x445.jpg.optimal.jpg 745w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-300x179.jpg.optimal.jpg 300w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1-768x459.jpg.optimal.jpg 768w, https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-website-1.jpg.optimal.jpg 1150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was to burst out into laughter. Just look at the Photoshop job they did on my face and hair! I’ve always liked my natural hair color (even though it’s turning &lt;span&gt;gray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/dunja0712/43026058702/in/dateposted/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;black and white&lt;/a&gt;), but I guess the creator of this franken-image prefers reddish tones. Except in the eyes though, where they removed &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever created this image, they also cut me out of the original background and pasted me onto a random photo of a park. I mean, the original photo was taken at f/2.0 if I remember well, and they needed the “before” and “after” – a photo with a sharp background, and another one where the almighty “portrait mode” blurred it out. So Samsung’s Photoshop master resolved it by using a different background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;twentytwenty-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/my-feature-focus-where-needed-109007145-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s23527.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/my-feature-focus-where-needed-109007137-745x419.jpg.optimal.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’d made my first sale on EyeEm and saw the image on Samsung Malaysia’s website right after that, I didn’t even assume that they’d stolen the image. I mean, why would they? It’s not expensive for a huge company like that to buy one stock photo. Although, to be honest, I think that they should have paid more for a better retoucher. But just to make sure, I got in touch with EyeEm, asking whether Samsung bought the image from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful lady from customer support told me that the sale wasn’t registered on EyeEm yet. However, she explained that sometimes buyers have subscriptions with Getty Images, meaning that they will be billed later for their photos. “Photos can be used months before we get sales data for the photo,” she added, and promised to keep me updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I contacted Getty to check whether the sale was made through their website. I never got a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried getting in touch with Samsung too, but it’s impossible to do it via its website unless you have a problem with some of the company’s devices. I sent a message to Samsung Global via Facebook, explaining my problem. All I got was a bunch of generic messages teaching me how to use Samsung smartphones. Thanks, Samsung, but I use Huawei. At least they do a better job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/huawei-passes-off-dslr-photos-as-smartphone-camera-photos-again/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;faking smartphone images&lt;/a&gt; with photos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/huawei-p9-leica-camera-sample-image-actually-shot-4500-canon-kit/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;shot on a DSLR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it’s nothing new that smartphone companies use DSLR photos to fake phone camera’s capabilities. Samsung did it before, so did Huawei. And I believe many more brands do it, we just haven’t found out about it yet. I’m pretty sure that Samsung at least bought my photo legally, even though I haven’t received the confirmation of it. But regardless, this is false advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that smartphone cameras are getting better (and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diyphotography.net/lg-patents-a-phone-with-16-lenses/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;more and more lenses&lt;/a&gt; with every new phone). But, we definitely shouldn’t trust the ads showing off their capabilities, or at least take them with a grain of salt. Although, to be honest – I doubt anyone would believe an ad with a Photoshop job this terrible anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google&amp;#039;s cross-platform Flutter UI toolkit goes 1.0</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/googles-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit-hits-version-1-0/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/googles-cross-platform-flutter-ui-toolkit-hits-version-1-0/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s UI toolkit for building mobile Android and iOS applications, hit its version 1.0 release today. In addition, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also today announced a set of new third-party integrations with the likes of Square and others, as well as a couple of new features that make it easier to integrate Flutter with existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-source &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/flutter-io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;flutter-io&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt; project made its debut at Google’s 2017 I/O developer conference. Since then, it’s quickly grown in popularity, and companies like Groupon, Philips Hue, Tencent, Alibaba, Capital One and others have &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/showcase&quot;&gt;already built applications&lt;/a&gt; with it, despite the fact that it had not hit version 1.0 yet and that developers have to write their apps in the Dart language, which is an additional barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, Google says, developers have already published “thousands” of Flutter apps to the Apple and Google app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754464&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;266&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flutter is our portable UI toolkit for creating a beautiful native experience for iOS and Android out of just a single code base,” Tim Sneath, Google’s group product manager for Dart, explained. “The problem we’re solving is the problem that most mobile developers face today. As a developer, you’re kind of forced to choose. Either you build apps natively using the platform SDK, whether you’re building an iOS app or an Android app. And then you’ve got to build them twice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneath was also part of the Silverlight team at Microsoft before he joined Google in 2017, so he’s got a bit of experience in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://adtmag.com/articles/2017/11/27/sneath-joins-flutter.aspx&quot;&gt;what doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; in this space of cross-platform development. It’s no secret, though, that Facebook is trying to solve a very similar problem with React Native, which is also quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754461&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pasted-image-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, React Native is obviously a technology that’s proven quite popular,” Sneath said. “One of the challenges that React Native developers face, or have reported in the past — one challenge is that native React Native code is written in JavaScript, which means that it’s run using the browser’s JavaScript engine, which immediately kind of move this a little bit away from the native model of the platform. The bit that they are very native in is that they use the operating system’s own controls. And while on the surface, that seems like a good thing in practice, that had quite a few challenges for developers around compatibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, obviously believes that its ability to compile to native code — and the speed gains that come with that — set its platform apart from the competition. In part, it does this by using a hardware-accelerated 2D engine and, of course, by compiling the Dart code to native ARM code for iOS and Android. The company also stresses that developers get full control over every pixel on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today’s launch, Google is also announcing new third-party integrations to Flutter. The first is with Square, which announced two new Flutter SDKs for building payments flows, both for in-app experience and in-person terminals using a Square reader. Others are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.2dimensions.com/&quot;&gt;2Dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, for building vector animations and embedding them right into Flutter, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nevercode.io/&quot;&gt;Nevercode&lt;/a&gt;, which announced a tool for automating the build and packaging process for Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for new Flutter features, Google today announced “Add to App,” a new feature that makes it easier for developers to slowly add Flutter code to existing apps. In its early days, Flutter’s focus was squarely on building new apps from scratch, but as it has grown in popularity, developers now want to use it for parts of their existing applications as they modernize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other new feature is “Platform Views,” which is essentially the opposite of “Add to App” in that it allows developers to embed Android and iOS controls in their Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft and Docker team up to make packaging cloud-native applications easier</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/microsoft-and-docker-team-up-to-make-packaging-and-running-cloud-native-applications-easier/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and Docker today announced a new joint open-source project, the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB), that aims to make the lifecycle management of cloud-native applications easier. At its core, the CNAB is nothing but a specification that allows developers to declare how an application should be packaged and run. With this, developers can define their resources and then deploy the application to anything from their local workstation to public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification was born inside Microsoft, but as the team talked to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/docker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;Docker,&lt;/a&gt; it turns out that the engineers there were working on a similar project. The two decided to combine forces and launch the result as a single open-source project. “About a year ago, we realized we’re both working on the same thing,” Microsoft’s Gabe Monroy told me. “We decided to combine forces and bring it together as an industry standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, Microsoft is launching its own reference implementation of a CNAB client today. Duffle, as it’s called, allows users to perform all the usual lifecycle steps (install, upgrade, uninstall), create new CNAB bundles and sign them cryptographically. Docker is working on integrating CNAB into its own tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also today launched Visual Studio extension for building and hosting these bundles, as well as an example implementation of a bundle repository server and an Electron installer that lets you install a bundle with the help of a GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s worth noting that we’re talking about a specification and reference implementations here. There is obviously a huge ecosystem of lifecycle management tools on the market today that all have their own strengths and weaknesses. “We’re not going to be able to unify that tooling,” said Monroy. “I don’t think that’s a feasible goal. But what we can do is we can unify the model around it, specifically the lifecycle management experience as well as the packaging and distribution experience. That’s effectively what Docker has been able to do with the single-workload case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Microsoft and Docker would like for the specification to end up in a vendor-neutral foundation. Which one remains to be seen, though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencontainers.org/&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; seems like the natural home for a project like this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing Open Source of WPF, Windows Forms, and WinUI</title>
<link>https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/12/04/announcing-open-source-of-wpf-windows-forms-and-winui-at-microsoft-connect-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/12/04/announcing-open-source-of-wpf-windows-forms-and-winui-at-microsoft-connect-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Build 2018, I outlined our approach to helping you be more productive when developing apps, including the introduction of .NET Core 3.0. We also started decoupling many parts of the Windows development platform, so you can adopt technologies incrementally. Today at Microsoft Connect(); 2018 Conference we shared the next steps – specifically to support innovations in UI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 adds support for building client apps using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, and XAML Islands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPF, Windows Forms, and Windows UI XAML Library (WinUI) are now open source, so you can create experiences with the freedom you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Scott Guthrie announced today, the first preview of .NET Core 3.0 is available. This version of .NET adds support for building Windows desktop apps using WPF and Windows Forms. You will now be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run multiple instances of .NET Core 3.0 side-by-side on the same computer so you can update WPF and Windows Forms apps to a new version of .NET without updating the entire OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use modern controls and Fluent styling from the WinUI XAML Library via XAML Islands from .NET Core 3.0 apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://aka.ms/netcore3preview1&quot;&gt;.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1&lt;/a&gt;, try out the preview, and give us feedback. The next version of the .NET Framework, .NET Framework 4.8, will include new controls that use the latest browser and media players in Windows 10, support the latest standards, and WPF and Windows Forms apps will have access to WinUI via XAML Islands for modern look and touch support. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/10/04/update-on-net-core-3-0-and-net-framework-4-8/&quot;&gt;The .NET Team blog&lt;/a&gt; details the differences and compatibility between .NET Core and .NET Framework moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey is our continued commitment to creating the development platform with you, through open source. Our three, popular Windows UX frameworks are ready for your contributions on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/wpf&quot;&gt;WPF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/winforms&quot;&gt;Windows Forms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml&quot;&gt;WinUI&lt;/a&gt;. Open sourcing these technologies provides transparency between the product team and the community, helps democratize Windows development, and enables the community to engage and contribute to these repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to your contributions. You can get started with Windows Forms and WinUI now. WPF is starting with System.Xaml, with more to come over the following months.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google personalizes search results even when you’re logged out, new study finds</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18124718/google-search-results-personalized-unique-duckduckgo-filter-bubble</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18124718/google-search-results-personalized-unique-duckduckgo-filter-bubble</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;NAeTEU&quot;&gt;The amount of personalization inherent in any one of Google’s many massive software products runs deep, based on everything from your search history to your location to every single search link you might have clicked. And avoiding that personalization seems to have become more difficult over the years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/p/a68069bc-b85f-4d13-8e11-2b1d454c11e9/&quot;&gt;According to a new study conducted by Google competitor DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, it does not seem possible to avoid personalization when using Google search, even by logging out of your Google account and using the private browsing “incognito” mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TkV0VK&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo conducted the study in June of this year, at the height of the US midterm election season. It did so with the ostensible goal of confirming whether Google’s search results exacerbate ideological bubbles by feeding you only information you’ve signaled you want to consume via past behavior and the data collected about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Y9d2ET&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The study found that Google search results varied significantly, even in private mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q2KmAb&quot;&gt;It’s not clear whether that question can be reliably answered with these findings, and it’s also obvious DuckDuckGo is a biased source with something to gain by pointing out how flawed Google’s approach may be. But the study’s findings are nonetheless interesting because they highlight just how much variance there are in Google search results, even when controlling for factors like location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Sv7Oh2&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo found that a majority of participants in its study saw different results when searching three divisive terms: “gun control,” “immigration,” and “vaccinations.” According to the company, “these discrepancies could not be explained by changes in location, time, by being logged in to Google, or by Google testing algorithm changes to a small subset of users.” DuckDuckGo says it controlled for location by treating local results that varied across regions as though they were identical. “Interestingly, this adjustment didn’t affect overall variation significantly,” the study reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;r6Np0f&quot;&gt;For the study, DuckDuckGo compiled 87 result sets (76 on desktop and 11 on mobile), and it conducted the searches consecutively and simultaneously starting at 9PM ET on June 24th, 2018. It did one private, logged-out test and then a logged-in test immediately after, so as not to influence the private test with prior results. What DuckDuckGo found was that using private browsing and logging out of Google had almost no effect on the variation in search results: users saw a roughly equitable amount of variation across all three searches and when searching privately and while logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JsOz7Z&quot;&gt;Some key elements to the variation included changes in news sources and the placement of sometimes identical links in different positions, which has a drastic impact on the likelihood that they get clicked. The study also found variations in how news articles and videos were laid out among standard text links, and as many as 22 different domains showing up in the first page of results for “vaccinations,” with a standard search result page typically containing 10 organic links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;IhMdBy&quot;&gt;Perhaps most importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any way to get a single, objective search result from Google that can be easily replicable across users or locations. To further drive home the point that private and logged-out searches are still equally variable, DuckDuckGo calculated the difference between text results for private, logged-out users and compared them to both the results of other anonymous users and the standard, logged-in search results for those initial users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nkDhab&quot;&gt;“We saw that when randomly comparing people’s private modes to each other, there was more than double the variation than when comparing someone’s private mode to their normal mode,” the study reads. The data indicates that between standard, logged-in search results and private, logged-out ones, there was typically a difference of only one or two domains, while the variation between anonymous users was from three (for gun control) to five (for vaccinations) domain changes. That indicates that there is some heavy personalization going on for people using private browsing when logged out, and it’s not clear why that is or what effect it’s having on user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;M5ct6F&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the study seems to prove that there’s no easy way to use Google search without the software seemingly trying to determine who you are and whether it can better serve your needs. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; technology companies all over the world built businesses around being smarter, faster, better automated, and more personal. (And by giving away really useful, ad-supported products for free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M60rM0&quot;&gt;A majority of internet users wouldn’t use Google search if it wasn’t constantly a best-in-class search engine, with a number of tangential benefits, like the Chrome browser tie-ins, that make it a lot easier and more convenient than, say, DuckDuckGo. But it’s still unsettling to know that there’s so much unseen, algorithmic tinkering going on when you perform a basic action, like searching one or two-word terms on Google. And that there’s really nothing we can do to get a neutral result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;kUiHQ8&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says incognito mode doesn’t base results on signed-in search histories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N6Z6CO&quot;&gt;Google could not comment on a study it did not have access to, but the company says that search results can change by the minute and sometimes even by the second, especially for news topics. Google also says that personalization is done on only a small fraction of the total number of queries entered into search, and relying on recent queries is often to determine the context for a search, like when a word may apply to a sports team and a city simultaneously. The company did confirm that it does not personalize results for incognito searches using signed-in search history, and it also confirmed that it does not personalize results for the Top Stories row or the News tab in search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a1vulN&quot;&gt;Following the study’s publication this morning, Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it found the methodology flawed and the findings misleading. “This study’s methodology and conclusions are flawed since they are based on the assumption that any difference in search results are based on personalization. That is simply not true,” a Google spokesperson said. “In fact, there are a number of factors that can lead to slight differences, including time and location, which this study doesn’t appear to have controlled for effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jXF95i&quot;&gt;In a separate series of statements, Danny Sullivan, who ran the influential Search Engine Land blog and now works as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@searchliaison&quot;&gt;Google’s public liaison for search&lt;/a&gt;, echoed similar sentiments on Twitter about the nature of personalization in Google Search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;cZHKEu&quot; readability=&quot;8.1&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.5294117647059&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Over the years, a myth has developed that Google Search personalizes so much that for the same query, different people might get significantly different results from each other. This isn’t the case. Results can differ, but usually for non-personalized reasons. Let’s explore…&lt;/p&gt;
— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1070027261376491520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nwO8FE&quot;&gt;It’s important to note that any kind of personalization, even based on just location, isn’t a new feature or something Google has been doing behind the scenes without anyone’s knowledge. The company began personalizing search results for every user, even those without a Google account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-now-personalizes-everyones-search-results-31195&quot;&gt;way back in 2009&lt;/a&gt; using an anonymous cookie that would take into account information like your location, language, search history, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DeC4E2&quot;&gt;More recently, the company says it’s moved away from personalizing search results, even as it increasingly uses personalization for products like Google Assistant and Gmail because it didn’t seem to really improve the search experience. “A query a user comes with usually has so much context that the opportunity for personalization is just very limited,” Pandu Nayak, the head of ranking at Google search, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/google-tests-changes-to-its-search-algorithm-how-search-works.html&quot;&gt;told CNBC in September&lt;/a&gt;. Google says it still personalizes for location and “immediate context from a prior search.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4u2s3f&quot;&gt;Regardless, Google has come under fire in the last couple of years for engaging in practices that, while not exactly clandestine, were certainly not widely known and likely kept out of the limelight to avoid too much public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JXEuck&quot;&gt;One notable example, surfaced by an investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, was how app developers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550830/congress-google-apple-third-party-app-republicans&quot;&gt;often able to read your personal Gmail messages&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted concern from some users and a congressional inquiry. Google also felt the need to stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15862492/google-gmail-advertising-targeting-privacy-cloud-business&quot;&gt;scanning Gmail messages to target advertisements last year&lt;/a&gt; because it was worried that the practice, when it came to light in contract negotiations, might scare away enterprise companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;rhKcdN&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has come under fire for not being transparent about how its products work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;llHg1j&quot;&gt;Google also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951914/google-plus-data-breach-exposed-user-profile-information-privacy-not-disclosed&quot;&gt;failed to disclose a flaw in a Google+ API&lt;/a&gt; that could have exposed hundreds of thousands of users’ personal information for roughly six months, an action that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17964134/google-plus-congress-privacy-data-vulnerability&quot;&gt;might result in a Federal Trade Commission investigation&lt;/a&gt;. And in September, Google was forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17904762/google-chrome-sign-in-changes-feedback&quot;&gt;reverse a controversial Chrome login feature&lt;/a&gt; that would help it better target ads by automatically logging users into the browser without their express permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1OXU1T&quot;&gt;The common thread here is that Google’s products, while often free to use and usually quite well-designed, only make money by using a vast trove of personal information to sell targeted online advertisements. And to improve how much money it makes from each ad sale, and the total quantity of ads it sells, Google often resorts to tactics its users have little insight into or deep understanding about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1n9cQo&quot;&gt;Personalized search results aren’t necessarily nefarious on their own. But the ways Google’s algorithms function — especially those that are now aided by complex and often unexplainable artificial intelligence software — are and always will be outside the understanding of the common user. By definition, that means most people have no idea how they work, including lawmakers and members of privacy watchdogs and advocacy groups. That could be a problem for a company like Google as it tries to maneuver a consumer market and a legislative environment that’s not quite as forgiving or negligent as it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caRW6O&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/5, 2:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google calling the study’s methodology flawed. The headline has been updated to reflect that Google’s personalization of search results is a claim being made by its competitor DuckDuckGo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0dPQ4U&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/5, 3:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Included public statements on the nature of personalization in Google search from Danny Sullivan, the company’s liaison for search, published on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fortnite dev launches Epic Games Store that takes just 12% of revenue</title>
<link>https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/04/fortnite-dev-launches-epic-games-store-that-takes-just-12-of-revenue/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/04/fortnite-dev-launches-epic-games-store-that-takes-just-12-of-revenue/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The 30/70 revenue-sharing split that turned into something of an industry standard is on the ropes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/tag/epic-games/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, the developer responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/tag/fortnite/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Fortnite phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;, is launching its own game store. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/12/fortnite-creator-epic-gives-unreal-asset-creators-a-raise-and-backpay/&quot;&gt;like with its asset store for developers&lt;/a&gt;, Epic is planning to take a 12 percent cut of revenues. This will leave 88 percent for the people who actually make the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a developer ourselves, we have always wanted a platform with great economics that connects us directly with our players,” Epic Games CEO Time Sweeney explained in a statement. “Thanks to the success of Fortnite, we now have this and are ready to share it with other developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic is planning to launch its Game Store with a small number of hand-picked titles. It will continue to add games throughout 2019, and Sweeney says his team will “open the store up more widely later on.” It plans to reveal some of the games that will show up on its store at The Game Awards on Thursday, December 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epic Games Store has an approval process for each game, but the company doesn’t plan to make judgments based on content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will mostly focus on the technical side of things and general quality,” Sweeney told GamesBeat. “Except for adult-only content, we don’t plan to curate based on developers’ creative or artistic expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Epic a threat to Steam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic’s new market is a shot across the bow of Valve, which controls a significant portion of the PC gaming business. Valve’s Steam store has traditionally taken a 30 percent cut of revenues from every developer, but it just announced a change to that over the weekend. Steam still takes 30 percent for every game until they make $10 million in sales. From $10 million through $50 million, Steam now takes 25 percent. And it takes just 20 percent for every sale over $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve is clearly attempting to keep blockbuster publishers and developers from jumping to their own platforms. But now the Steam changes also look like a preemptive effort to stay competitive with Epic. But its new tiered revenue-sharing model does leave out indie developers. Epic, however, is making it clear that it plans to take just 12 percent across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not looking to crush Steam any time soon,” Sweeney explained to GamesBeat. “We’re just building a store with a fair deal for developers that creates new opportunities for content creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A developer-first approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Epic is starting small, the platform’s goal is to disrupt game distribution. And Epic knows that it has to compete with and undercut Steam to do that. The company provided the following graphic with its announcement materials, and it directly compares itself to Steam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2426439&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2426439&quot; src=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/epic-versus-steam.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;amp;strip=all&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Above: Epic Games Store versus Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image Credit: Epic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice the above chart also answers a couple of other questions. For example, Epic welcomes games made with Unity into its store. Epic is known for Fortnite, but it is also the owner and operator of the Unreal Engine game-development toolkit. But the company isn’t planning to use its store to give unfair protections to Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart also shows that Epic won’t charge the 5-percent revenue sharing fee for games that use the Unreal Engine on its store. On Steam, Unreal-based games will still have to fork over 5 percent on top of the 30 percent they must give to Valve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is the right time for Epic’s message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Valve is showing for the first time ever that it is flexible when it comes to the 30/70 revenue model, it may have inadvertently set up Epic to make an even bigger splash with its store announcement. Indie developers are furious with Valve for giving a larger cut to bigger publishers while small studios have to keep giving up $3 out of every $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Epic showing up with a potentially viable alternative to Steam is starting to look like a glass of water in the desert. And Epic only taking $1.20 out of every $10 makes that deal even sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Valve’s recent decision to only give certain developers a better cut than the archaic 30/70 split put blood in the water, and Epic opening a store with a better cut is basically shark bait,” Vlambeer cofounder (and de facto indie-gaming spokesperson) Rami Ismail told GamesBeat. “Obviously, the Epic Store announcement has been in the making a lot longer than Valve’s decision to favor certain developers, but for Epic it could not have come at a better time. Any developer — triple-A or indie — will be interested in keeping that additional 18 percent of revenue to increase the chances for future projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ismail is happy about the cut, but he points out that he’s more excited about competition in the distribution space. Valve started publishing third-party games in 2005, and just a few years later it had a stranglehold on the PC game market. And it wasn’t until the last couple of years that developers and publishers beyond Electronic Arts began launching their own platforms to bypass Valve’s cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of competition in PC-game distribution has made the 30/70 split seem immovable. In the gaming world, you will die and pay your taxes, but you also have to give Valve its 30 percent. And the reason that number seemed like someone etched it in stone hundreds of years ago is because the stuff Steam does cheap at scale used to cost individual developers a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/stxVBJem3Rs&quot;&gt;a talk at the Game Developers Conference in March&lt;/a&gt;, Spiderweb Software developer Jeff Vogel explained why that percentage hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hear indie developers complain about the cut that Apple and Steam take,” Vogel said in his presentation. “But all of the stuff that Steam does for you and makes easy, I’ve had to do myself. I’ve hired full-time employees to do the stuff that Steam does. I know how much it costs, and more importantly, they do too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stuff includes processing credit cards, running a customer-support system, bandwidth, and a million other tiny details. The 30/70 cut had little to do with how much it costs Valve to operate Steam. Instead, that 30-percent fee came from how much Steam was worth to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s easier than ever to do what Steam does&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it’s looking like that split is not long for this world. And that’s because things have changed. It’s easier than ever to process credit cards. Many developers already employ third-party services to help run their customer support on top of Steam’s built-in tools. Cloud technology is more affordable than ever due to competition between Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, so actually storing and distributing games is more attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why more and more publishers have launched their own platforms. And for indies, they have seen that &lt;a href=&quot;http://itch.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Itch.io — a platform similar to Steam but for small, experimental indie games&lt;/a&gt; — can do nearly everything that Steam does at a fraction of the budget. These alternative platforms and the falling cost of services have put a fracture in the 30/70 cut, and now Epic could kill it for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about the gamers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic’s strategy for now is “developer’s first.” The company is trying to attract companies to its platform with a better revenue split, and that should work. After all, millions of people have now installed the Epic Games Launcher to play Fortnite on their PCs. Now that portal has a store in it as well. So Epic doesn’t have to do a ton of work to present its market to potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But giving developers a better deal doesn’t necessarily matter to consumers. For the average PC gaming fan, they are likely going to continue prioritizing convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m incredibly curious because in a way we’re going to see a battle between people’s currently owned games in their Steam library competing with Epic’s Fortnite,” said Ismail. “That’s going to be interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put that another way, Steam has a huge advantage because so many people already own games on that platform. And those consumers probably won’t want to switch to the Epic Games Store. They won’t want to split their library between two different launchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Fortnite is is likely attracting a huge number of first-time PC gamers. If the Epic Games Store has every game that Steam has at similar prices, maybe Epic could capture the next generation of PC players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic does at least plan to offer a refund system, which is something that is a standard on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re launching with manual refunds through player support, and automated refunds will follow soon,” Sweeney told GamesBeat. “We expect to provide each user with ‘no-questions-asked’ refund tokens to use in the first 14 days after buying a game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blood in the water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Epic and Discord, the chat platform that launched a store recently, PC gaming is finally getting some competition. And Sweeney says that’s his most immediate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re giving game developers the store business model that we’ve always wanted as developers ourselves,” he told GamesBeat. “Hopefully, competition between stores will create new opportunities for all game developers.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What we learned from 3 years of bra engineering, and what&amp;#039;s next</title>
<link>https://bratheory.com/what-we-learned-and-whats-next/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bratheory.com/what-we-learned-and-whats-next/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Whenever someone asks me how Bra Theory is, I smile and say, “Good!” However, that’s the entrepreneur’s auto-reply in me speaking, since “&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306445&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306445&quot;&gt;I’m crushing it&lt;/a&gt;!” is the story we all want others to hear about our ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The real answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Bra Theory is the most challenging, most fulfilling undertaking I’ve yet to experience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Our goal is to deliver you a bra that fits your unique shape and size, saving you time and energy spent in the fitting room. In short, custom-made bras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Our approach is to develop the Rx of the bra — the formula that maps between measurements on the body and the blueprint of the bra itself — and build you a 100% custom, algorithmically-informed bra. It’s the missing link in being able to scale a custom-made solution, which would make it more attainable than the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kittyknowles/2018/06/18/luna-mae-lingerie-luxury-retail-bespoke-bra-fittings-savile-row-london/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kittyknowles/2018/06/18/luna-mae-lingerie-luxury-retail-bespoke-bra-fittings-savile-row-london/&quot;&gt;existing alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Three years later, Bra Theory is not quite where we thought we would be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;It’s been a wild ride of highs, lows, successes, and failures. That being said, every failure has been an invaluable lesson: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we are learning, through experimentation and doing the work, what it takes to get to the next level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Without further ado, I’m excited to share the lessons that we’ve learned in the past 3 years about bra engineering and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Lesson #1: Tech founders? Don’t be afraid to ditch the high-tech solution.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;In the beginning, I wrote a Python-based program that would take measurements as inputs and, after a few calculations, output the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_%28sewing%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_(sewing)&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; (or blueprint) of the bra. We built it end to end, even including the seam allowances and labels that bra-makers require to sew the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*iTVDDOZCynVdajPT0kHfjg.png&quot; alt=&quot;From the archives — August 2016&quot; width=&quot;744&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*iTVDDOZCynVdajPT0kHfjg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;744&quot; data-height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;From the archives — August 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;It made sense to me: this was the Unique Value Proposition of Bra Theory. While the industry knows how to make a perfect fit through multiple fittings, the labor costs of the R&amp;amp;D of the bra patterns could only be offset by economies of scale. Traditionally, bra-makers can take up to 48 fittings to perfect the cut of a bra, and getting it right in 1 fitting is considered a “blessing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;In order to make custom-made bras affordable, we had to reproduce that “blessing” of getting it right in one try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Our approach was to parametrize the equation, writing the software to help minimize the number of fittings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;However, as we learned more about bra-making, it soon became clear that we were more often way off the mark than right. Rewriting code was taking way longer than we anticipated… and we began to feel the pain of having a clunky solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;In 2016, we quickly learned a painful lesson: the important part was not the technology itself, but closing the feedback loop of measurements and bra-that-fits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;As much as I wanted to nerd out and build a sexy (pun-intended) 3D solution, we actually had to &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;scrap&lt;/em&gt; our algorithm for a period of time so that we could move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;So we ditched the algorithm for something more agile, with fewer assumptions: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we became a custom bra-maker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;We didn’t forget our vision. As our bra-makers taught me about the garment, I taught them about the algorithm. What we did had to be reproducible. Our resident bra-makers soon learned that whenever they “eyeballed” something, I was going to swoop in and ask a lot of annoying questions. We began to get feedback on the product, even if it wasn’t purely produced by code, in a way that could inform the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Though we pivoted from the 3D technology, it allowed us to simplify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;In 2016, we redefined our goal: define the formula for a happy customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aTkWeBceBCWav7ksX9Oezg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old approach vs new approach (defining the formula for a happy customer)&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*aTkWeBceBCWav7ksX9Oezg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3000&quot; data-height=&quot;2100&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--figure&quot;&gt;Lesson #2: Be prepared to learn all the reasons why no one has solved your problem.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--figure&quot;&gt;I started this journey uninformed and optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*8fhMDC45_obQNH_qgvVVfQ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*8fhMDC45_obQNH_qgvVVfQ.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;216&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;After preliminary research and speaking to industry experts, I was aware of the complexity of bra-making. I was even aware of the above graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;However, I did not &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok&quot;&gt;grok&lt;/a&gt; the time it would take to discover and understand the complicating factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Through more trial-and-error that I’d like to admit, we have learned through firsthand experience many of the variables behind bra-making. I will name a short list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;Whether or not a customer bloats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;Dye color (black is more rigid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;Stretch properties of the fabrics, which differ from mill to mill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;Temperature of the measuring tape at time of measuring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;Elasticity/malleability of the breast, which in turn affects the shape of the breast when lifted and contained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;The precision of how the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://bratheory.com/?p=6044&amp;amp;preview=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bratheory.com/?p=6044&amp;amp;preview=true&quot;&gt;underwire&lt;/a&gt; needs to be manipulated to sit properly below the breast root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;The precision of pattern-making. Sometimes, millimeters can matter. Other times, you can cheat up to 1 cm of tolerance. When and where is key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;The positioning of the strap attachment at the back, which affects the inward tension that prevents the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6098&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=6098&amp;amp;action=edit&quot;&gt;straps from slipping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;How fabrics behave when overlaid on top of each other, thus controlling stretch in different vectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Is this an intimidating proposition? Occasionally. On other occasions, it’s &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;fascinating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Is this a solvable problem? Yes. Our process, for example, can include a custom underwire fitting that no other Ready-to-Wear brand can possibly include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6225&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6225 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_9835-300x225.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Different sized underwires&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; srcset=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_9835-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_9835-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpeg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Different sized underwires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;While we still have a lot of work to do, we haven’t discovered anything that says, “No, this is impossible.” Thus far, every failure has been an opportunity to handle a new &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling&quot;&gt;exception&lt;/a&gt; in our algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Three years later, we’ve been through the trenches of informed pessimism, and are finally on the upswing to optimism. The key to getting past the trench?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Keep going.&lt;/em&gt; You need to maintain a light awareness of all the “no”s — but don’t focus on them — so that you can navigate a path through the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #3: Collaboration is key.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Through sheer stubbornness about the experimental method, Bra Theory was able to validate the hard and soft rules of bra-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;However… did we have to discover it all first-hand, or could we have taken a bra-maker’s word for some of the novice mistakes that we made?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The answer is somewhere in between, which is why &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;it’s important to collaborate with a domain expert as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Partnering with an expert means that someone can point out the pitfalls before we fall, face first, into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*LC0qg1e9gBTu_KG9ag8EhQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit A: the mysterious bra dent&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LC0qg1e9gBTu_KG9ag8EhQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;419&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Exhibit A: the mysterious “dent”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Notice the dent in the middle of the cup. While it is not too noticeable, especially in a photograph, we were certain that no customer would want a dent right where the fullest part of their breast should be. Our in-house team of myself and our freelancer designer were puzzled, until we consulted with an expert with specific industry experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot;&gt;“Have you measured the seams?” she asked. “I know it sounds silly, but the smallest difference can make a large difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;A single millimeter — that was all that it took to knock us out for an afternoon. Since then, we’ve never made the same mistake twice, and measure more carefully… but it would be better to not make a mistake like this, even once!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Our key to success will be a beginner’s mind, an expert’s experience, and a healthy dialogue between the two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The caveat to this lesson is that not every expert will understand your vision, and you’ll have to prove out your concept before they decide to all-in with you. I like to think of this as the modern “&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.dave-bailey.com/its-never-too-late-to-get-a-non-technical-cofounder-a34df62541fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.dave-bailey.com/its-never-too-late-to-get-a-non-technical-cofounder-a34df62541fb&quot;&gt;Non-Technical Founder Seeks Technical Founder&lt;/a&gt;” dilemma, except we’re talking about bra tech (#BraTech).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #4: Perfect is the enemy of good.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Like many others, I founded Bra Theory because I’ve always been on the elusive quest for the “perfect bra.” I even made a &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZP7SfuW5B4hW4dt28_3t7Z8qpC3E0hKL8Jg-24KFGU/edit#gid=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZP7SfuW5B4hW4dt28_3t7Z8qpC3E0hKL8Jg-24KFGU/edit#gid=0&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, years ago when I was still shopping on the market! For better and worse, that desire for perfectionism carried into the ethos of Bra Theory. We were ambitious, and aimed to deliver the Perfect Bra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;There’s a reason for that. From all the conversations we’ve had with women, we heard, again and again, how they feel like they’re &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;“settling for the least bad bra.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;It’s an uncomfortable and often unsatisfying experience. Some women choose to delay shopping for bras for years until they absolutely have to; others have given up entirely on bras, disillusioned by the entire category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-6219 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Word-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What we're up against&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Word-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Word-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Word-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Word-900x600.jpg 900w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Besides, we’re a custom bra maker… a custom-made bra &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; be perfect, especially if you’re paying $350 for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the thought of “Perfect” slowed us down from “Good Enough”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;In the early days of Bra Theory, nothing was quite perfect enough to hit our “launch” button. I spent 2016 &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogfood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogfood&quot;&gt;dog-fooding&lt;/a&gt; our bra, which meant that we worked through far too many prototypes for one person (which can lead to an &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overfitting.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overfitting.asp&quot;&gt;overfitting&lt;/a&gt; error). By 2017, we had engineered one working bra: Bra Theory v2.1.1.17 for Mona Zhang, wide-and-tall-rooted 30E. In retrospect, a customer would probably kick us to the curb by fitting #7 — which, in retrospect, might have given us a wake-up call. If 17 fittings is unacceptable for a customer, it’s unacceptable for Bra Theory, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Our key lesson: it was never up to us to decide what’s Good Enough. It was always up to the customer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;We made bras for friends and family in November 2017 to validate “Good Enough,” and as soon as we got the green light, we hit the metaphorical launch button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;In 2018, we launched our Beta: it was time to invite strangers from the Internet into our studio, and do it live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #5: Just say yes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I had an assumption that in order to launch our Beta to paying customers in 2018, we needed a nicer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;You see, we were measuring and fitting friends and family in a space that looked like my living room, because it WAS my living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot;&gt;“Are you sure you NEED a space?” asked my product manager, &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://brookekao.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://brookekao.com&quot;&gt;Brooke Kao&lt;/a&gt;, who is a strong advocate of prioritizing must-haves, not nice-to-haves. “You know, I went to an Etsy shop in a Manhattan mini-storage the other day… I thought I was going to get mugged, but when I got inside it was okay!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I’ve heard the stories about&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2013/10/29/steve-jobs-apple-garage-landmark/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2013/10/29/steve-jobs-apple-garage-landmark/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs in his garage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;… but could we launch a bra company in a garage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;No, I thought, and I made a decision: I commissioned &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kmfg.space/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.kmfg.space/&quot;&gt;Kate Grau&lt;/a&gt;, a friend and fellow dreamer, to design a comfortable space on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*vDOwQw4QqTeMT0-38bdhFA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Bra Theory SoHo studio&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; height=&quot;479&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*vDOwQw4QqTeMT0-38bdhFA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;357&quot; data-height=&quot;479&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Bra Theory SoHo studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Was it over-optimization? Yes. We realized, after asking our customers for feedback, that they didn’t &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; this space. They had expected to be in a WeWork, though they, too, wondered how we would finagle a nude fitting with “&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeantang/2016/04/28/being-at-wework-the-reality-of-coworking-office-space/#15e81a331f8c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeantang/2016/04/28/being-at-wework-the-reality-of-coworking-office-space/#15e81a331f8c&quot;&gt;a single dry wall and seven sides of glass&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Now we work out of &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://the-wing.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://the-wing.com&quot;&gt;The Wing SoHo&lt;/a&gt;, which is a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*jMoWXpmcZA9J9OfxlksjuA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Feeling at home at The Wing&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*jMoWXpmcZA9J9OfxlksjuA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Feeling at home at The Wing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;While we over-optimized this one, the important part is that we did what we thought we needed to do to move forward. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;We made the mistake of over-optimization. As a result, we stopped thinking about it as a limiting factor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I agree that entrepreneurs need to learn how to say “no.” However, I’ve found it helpful to say “yes” when you’re just getting started, so long as it gets you closer to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Besides, there’s always a place in between “over-optimization” and “making your best educated guess.” When we explained the Manhattan Mini-Storage idea to one of our customers, she laughed and admitted, “Huh… yeah, I probably wouldn’t have come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;(Alternative lesson: Do not launch a lingerie company in a Manhattan mini-storage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The other upside to saying yes is that you give yourself leverage to move forward.&lt;/strong&gt; As soon as we committed to setting up our space, we did. As soon we said yes to a cadence of 2 customers a month, without the production capacity to guarantee it… we found the production capacity. If you put yourself between a rock and a hard place, and you’ll find your way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #5: Launch!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-6228 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bill-jelen-555154-unsplash-200x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bill-jelen-555154-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bill-jelen-555154-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bratheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bill-jelen-555154-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px&quot;/&gt;A mentor gave me advice three years ago: “Knowing you, launch earlier than later. It’ll never be perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I had resistance to this. I’m well aware that there’s a sense of fatigue and learned helplessness when it comes to bras, and I didn’t want to add to their pain by launching something that wasn’t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;What they don’t tell you is that your early adopters will be the best people ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Your Minimal Viable Product will be far from perfect for your customers, and that’s the point: you’ll grow with them.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone will take a chance on you, and when you find them, you will have found your tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;In November of 2017, we launched our website and Beta program. Our demand exceeds our production, which means we have to say no to those waiting patiently on our waitlist. We’ve been calling them in order to get to know them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Another point of resistance came up for me: how can we launch, when we can’t deliver? &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Will they want to give 15 minutes of their time, if we cannot solve their problem right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;We have only learned, more and more, that the problem is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;There is some disappointment, but above all, there is hope. This is what they say at the end of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot;&gt;“Godspeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #6: Your health as an entrepreneur matters.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I have to admit — part of the reason that Bra Theory is not further along is because I had neglected my physical, mental, and emotional health for 25 years prior. It took a backseat to my goals, education, and career. As an over-achiever, Princeton English major, and auto-didactic software engineer, I had fancy titles, but little self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Eventually, it caught up to me. After a bout of an un-diagnosed eating disorder from 2013–2015, acid reflux in 2016, and extreme IBS-C in 2017, I had to dedicate myself to troubleshooting my health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I learned the hard way that if you’re an entrepreneur, most often, the limiting factor is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;you —&lt;/strong&gt; which includes your health and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I don’t mean that in an unkindly way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;If you’re the one doing the brunt of the work to make the impossible possible, you need to treat yourself like your star employee.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately for anyone who has had an eating disorder, you deal with a lot of self-hate — and it is near impossible to run a business from that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The time I invested in myself, in turn, made me more capable of achieving my goals: I now have more energy, creativity in addition to analytical ability, and a &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/&quot;&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Lesson learned: working productively includes accounting for my feelings, desires, and personal life. Who knew — I’m human! So are you, and so are your employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;graf graf--h3&quot;&gt;Lesson #7: Remember who you’re building for.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Paradoxically, a custom bra is not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The price is the main blocker for most people. The full custom-made bra (multiple fittings until you are happy with the fit) is $350. A trial of one measuring and one fitting is a $175 deposit, money back if you don’t like the fit. I am going to &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me&quot;&gt;pull a Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and say that our ultimate goal is to use the cash from our premium product to invest in the R&amp;amp;D of an affordable ~$135 option, but it could be a while until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;As of June 2018, our Cost of Goods Sold was $440 due to multiple fittings. We launched with the retail price of $550, with a strikeout: Name Your Price, a sales promotion for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;The experiment was ill-designed, and we discovered that people will name all sorts of prices when there is no price tag on a product. For example, we received several “$1” bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Then there was a woman — who we’ll call Cardamom — and she put down $550. She wrote a comment that I now keep on a post-it note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have shed more tears than is healthy over this and the bra situation is the biggest sorrow of my life. I am hoping you can solve the issue and help women like me. I’ll be watching and following closely!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Since then, I’ve noticed that Cardamom opens our monthly newsletter, every month, without fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Cardamom is out there, and there are more of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I started this venture because I had a &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/bra-theory/why-i-have-a-problem-with-bras-ff75f0e6fe23&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/bra-theory/why-i-have-a-problem-with-bras-ff75f0e6fe23&quot;&gt;problem with bras&lt;/a&gt;. But in a weird way, I’d wonder if I was alone. That’s what you end up believing — that you’re the odd one out, and that you’re the one with the “weird” boobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;That’s why I am grateful for my breasts, and for this mission. Through Bra Theory, I have realized that I am not alone, and that there is something that I — and we — can do to change the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;Whenever I encounter hardships and challenges in Bra Theory (&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/jessica-bruder/psychological-price-of-entrepreneurship.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/jessica-bruder/psychological-price-of-entrepreneurship.html&quot;&gt;it’s entrepreneurship!&lt;/a&gt;), I think of Cardamom, and of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;I remember that, if I don’t succeed, there is going to be another little girl with breasts that are not your average 34B, with &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/bra-theory/an-open-love-letter-to-my-boobs-e10c2d1a5576&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/bra-theory/an-open-love-letter-to-my-boobs-e10c2d1a5576&quot;&gt;tears in her eyes&lt;/a&gt; from her experience with bras.&lt;/p&gt;
