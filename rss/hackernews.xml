<title>Apple Terminates Epic Games&amp;#039; Developer Account</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-developer-account/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple in mid-August said that it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/17/apple-terminate-epic-developer-accounts-august-28/&quot;&gt;terminate Epic Games' developer account&lt;/a&gt; if the Fortnite app continued to break the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; rules, and today, Apple followed through with that threat and removed Epic's access to the Epic Games account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortnite has been unavailable for a few weeks, but other Epic Games titles like Battle Breakers and Infinity Blade Stickers were still in the ‌App Store‌. Now that the Epic Games developer account has been terminated, those apps are gone.
&lt;p&gt;Searching for Epic Games in the ‌App Store‌ brings up no apps and on the web, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/epic-games/id387428403&quot;&gt;Epic Games developer account&lt;/a&gt; is blank. Though the Epic Games developer account is no longer available, Fortnite continues to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have downloaded Fortnite on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/&quot;&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; can continue to play the game, but there's a catch - none of the new Marvel-themed Season 4 content is available because Fortnite is unable to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnite has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/&quot;&gt;in violation&lt;/a&gt; of the ‌App Store‌ rules since August 13, when it introduced a direct payment option that skirted Apple's in-app purchase system by allowing payments directly to Epic Games. Shortly after Epic blatantly disregarded ‌App Store‌ policies, Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/&quot;&gt;pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; from the ‌App Store‌, leading to a lawsuit from Epic and a quickly escalating legal fight between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Epic initiated the dispute with Apple, it has refused to back down from the direct purchase option added to Fortnite, and Apple has refused to allow the app in the ‌App Store‌ while the direct payment option remains. Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/25/apple-statement-restraining-order-ruling-epic-games/&quot;&gt;told Epic&lt;/a&gt; that it was ready to &quot;welcome Fortnite back onto iOS&quot; if Epic removed the direct payment option and returned to the status quo while the legal battle plays out in court, but Epic has refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Epic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/28/fortnite-emails-new-season-unavailable/&quot;&gt;sent out emails&lt;/a&gt; to Fortnite players blaming the unavailability of the new season on Apple and claming that Apple is &quot;blocking Fortnite&quot; in order to prevent Epic Games from &quot;passing on the savings from direct payments to players.&quot; Apple in turn has taken to featuring Fortnite competitor PUBG in its ‌App Store‌.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1310&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-756812 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://images.macrumors.com/images-new/1x1.trans.gif&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.macrumors.com/t/7ini1LsNykkRu8nXON5xati1Rzk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/08/pubgapple.jpg?lossy&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://images.macrumors.com/t/7ini1LsNykkRu8nXON5xati1Rzk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/08/pubgapple.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Yr2K3wnhx2PSGK-u8Rx0BD77MW4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/08/pubgapple.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/75nE2x8Lm4pD34-EtPPD6t0pNOg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/08/pubgapple.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_X1YYTe-hGi8hl_oAvwQE8a5WVo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2020/08/pubgapple.jpg 2500w&quot; sizes=&quot;&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apple originally wanted to terminate the developer accounts of both Epic Games and Epic International, a separate account linked to Epic's Unreal Engine used by third-party app developers, but a judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/24/apple-epic-court-battle-august-28-removal/&quot;&gt;issued a temporary restraining order&lt;/a&gt; preventing Apple from doing so. The judge declined to stop Apple from terminating the Epic Games account, however, telling Epic that it &quot;created the situation&quot; and made a &quot;strategically and calculated move to breach&quot; ‌App Store‌ terms.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; In a statement, Apple confirmed the account has been removed and said it's disappointing that the termination had to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are disappointed that we have had to terminate the Epic Games account on the ‌App Store‌. We have worked with the team at Epic Games for many years on their launches and releases. The court recommended that Epic comply with the ‌App Store‌ guidelines while their case moves forward, guidelines they’ve followed for the past decade until they created this situation. Epic has refused. Instead they repeatedly submit Fortnite updates designed to violate the guidelines of the ‌App Store‌. This is not fair to all other developers on the ‌App Store‌ and is putting customers in the middle of their fight. We hope that we can work together again in the future, but unfortunately that is not possible today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple says that the termination applies only to the Epic Games developer account, and it occurred after Epic Games was provided with 14 days to comply with the ‌App Store‌ rules. The removal of the Epic Games account is Apple's standard process for all accounts that defy ‌App Store‌ policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic no longer has the option to submit apps or updates through its developer account and in-app purchases in the Fortnite app will no longer be a functional option for Fortnite players. Apple says that disabling in-app purchases will protect users as Fortnite's new season launches as Epic had been directing users to Apple's support staff to get purchase refunds.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;fef4&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;If the attacker only tried executing the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; transaction, it would revert without calling the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;burn&lt;/code&gt; function. We were hoping that by the time the attacker had executed both the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; transactions in sequence to spot the internal call to &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;pool.burn&lt;/code&gt; and frontrun us, our transactions would already be included.&lt;/p&gt;

Our rescue script.
&lt;p id=&quot;daf7&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;To our surprise, the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; transaction would get rejected by Infura even when we manually overrode the gas estimator. After several failed attempts and resets, the time pressure got to us, and we got sloppy. We let the second transaction slip into a later block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b3f7&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;It was a fatal mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

It turned out that, in the seconds after our &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; transaction entered the mempool, someone had executed the call and swept the funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;13b8&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;The monsters had devoured us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;1745&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk kf iy iz gn kg jb jc jd kh gs jf jg ki gv ji jj kj gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;We knew intellectually that these generalized frontrunning bots existed. But until you’ve actually seen them in action, you’re likely to underestimate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9918&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;We held out some hope that doing the rescue as an internal call via an authorized contract, passing a variable from storage as the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; address, might protect us. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6682&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;If you find yourself in a situation like this, we suggest you reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/epheph&quot; class=&quot;bh ii kk kl km kn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Scott Bigelow&lt;/a&gt;, a security researcher who has been studying this topic and has a prototype implementation for a better obfuscator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bcd0&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk kf iy iz gn kg jb jc jd kh gs jf jg ki gv ji jj kj gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;Even under time pressure, we should have stuck to the plan. If we had spent more time on the scripts, tweaked the contracts (perhaps changing the &lt;code class=&quot;dn kp kq kr ks b&quot;&gt;Getter&lt;/code&gt; contract to do nothing instead of reverting if called before being activated), or even synced our own node to avoid using Infura, we probably would have been able to get the transactions into the same block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;d0bf&quot; class=&quot;ma jo bo bn db mb mc iy md me jb mf mg gs mh mi gv mj mk gy ml de&quot;&gt;Don’t rely on normal infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

In our case, we were trying to submit a transaction that looked like it would fail based on the current blockchain state, which Infura has reasonable protections against. Using our own node could have sidestepped this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;02b0&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;Better yet, if you happen to know a miner (we didn’t), you could have them include the transaction directly in a block, skipping the mempool—and the monsters—entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;8716&quot; class=&quot;ma jo bo bn db mb mc iy md me jb mf mg gs mh mi gv mj mk gy ml de&quot;&gt;The future is only going to get scarier&lt;/h2&gt;

In the future, they &lt;em class=&quot;ko&quot;&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; reorder and submit transactions in their mempools for their benefit. Even worse, they could reorg blocks mined by other miners, in an attempt to steal MEV which was not claimed by them, resulting in chain instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3d94&quot; class=&quot;iu iv bo iw b gk ix iy iz gn ja jb jc jd je gs jf jg jh gv ji jj jk gy jl jm ef de&quot;&gt;We think this future can be prevented. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism&quot; class=&quot;bh ii kk kl km kn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Optimism&lt;/a&gt; (another Paradigm portfolio company) has an ambitious vision of how MEV can be redirected for the benefit of the ecosystem, as part of its layer-2 scaling solution, optimistic rollup.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zoom is now critical infrastructure – that’s a concern</title>
<link>https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/08/27/zoom-is-now-critical-infrastructure-thats-a-concern/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/08/27/zoom-is-now-critical-infrastructure-thats-a-concern/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a cybersecurity vulnerability that would have been unimaginable as recently as last year: A single California-based company, Zoom, is now the foundation for education access from elementary school up through graduate school. It has also become a critical tool for many businesses. When Zoom goes down, teachers can’t teach, students can’t learn, and business meetings, conferences, and webinars grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was demonstrated in dramatic form on Monday, August 24 when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/us/zoom-outage-worldwide-trnd/index.html&quot;&gt;widespread outage&lt;/a&gt; blocked many users from accessing Zoom. Just before 6 AM Pacific time, the company acknowledged the problem in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.zoom.us/&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, writing “We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them.” An hour later, Zoom said that it had “identified the issue” and was “working on a fix.” Finally, over three hours after it had first acknowledged the problem, Zoom announced that “We have resolved the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no evidence that the outage was malicious in origin. And it was resolved relatively quickly, although for teachers, students, and participants in business meetings who found themselves unable to convene, not nearly quickly enough. Without information regarding the details of how Zoom’s systems are designed and protected, it’s hard to identify the greatest sources of risk for future service interruptions. But the fact that the August 24 incident occurred at all underscores the possibility that future service outages, whether due to a systems failure or to a cyberattack, could leave classrooms and business meetings shut down for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing new about dependence on digital technologies, which underlie several of the Department of Homeland Security’s 16 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors&quot;&gt;critical infrastructure sectors&lt;/a&gt;, including “financial services,” “communications,” and “information technology.” But in many of the verticals in these sectors—such as banking or mobile phone services—no single company dominates the market. A cyberattack knocking a leading bank or mobile phone network provider offline for a few hours would be a major event and an enormous inconvenience for thousands of individuals and businesses, but it wouldn’t shut down the entirety of the financial system or of mobile cellular communications. By contrast, a successful cyberattack targeting Zoom could bring education and an enormous amount of business activity to a complete halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that Zoom is a relatively young company (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications&quot;&gt;founded in 2011&lt;/a&gt;) that has experienced some security-related growing pains. In March 2020, the company was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201234/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-video-chats-meetings&quot;&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for a dubious claim that it supported end-to-end encryption for videoconferences. As normally used, the term refers to exchanging encrypted content between two end users in a manner such that it can’t be decrypted while in transit, not even by the company managing the servers through which it passes. For instance, as Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209110&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; with respect to iMessage and FaceTime, “there’s no way for Apple to decrypt the content of your conversations when they are in transit between devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom’s approach was different. As a March &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in The Intercept explained, Zoom was actually using “transport encryption, which is different from end-to-end encryption because the Zoom service itself can access the unencrypted video and audio content of Zoom meetings. So when you have a Zoom meeting, the video and audio content will stay private from anyone spying on your Wi-Fi, but it won’t stay private from the company.” While Zoom subsequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.zoom.us/end-to-end-encryption-update/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on new software that will allow it to introduce end-to-end encryption, the fact that confusion on this point had arisen at all is concerning from a security standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of alternatives to Zoom, including Skype, Webex, and GoToMeeting. The challenge of course, is that Zoom has benefited from an enormous network effect. The time people have invested learning how to use Zoom and the licenses companies and universities have signed to make it their main platform for real-time video interactions create strong incentives against adopting an alternative. Just as most people wouldn’t want to purchase and carry two mobile phones, each connected to a different cellular network in case one of the networks goes down, organizations aren’t going to want to pay for licenses to non-Zoom videoconferencing platforms that they may rarely or never need. And people who have spent hours getting used to Zoom don’t want to start over on another platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In combination, these factors mean that we aren’t likely to shake our dependence on Zoom anytime soon. That’s a concern, because if a list of critical infrastructure sectors were created from scratch today, it would probably include videoconferencing as a distinct sector. Organizations that rely on video conferencing—and today, that’s most organizations—would be well served to put backup plans in place to minimize the disruption from future Zoom outages.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Visualize Data Structures in VS Code</title>
<link>https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/tree/master/extension</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/tree/master/extension</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=hediet_dev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/74813140ec111d9ec21acea4a47508a870c6dec9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f747769747465722f666f6c6c6f772f6865646965745f6465762e7376673f7374796c653d736f6369616c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/hediet_dev.svg?style=social&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VS Code extension for visualizing data structures while debugging. Like the VS Code's watch view, but with rich visualizations of the watched value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://hediet.github.io/visualization/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore all available visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supported Languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/demos&quot;&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt; for demos. These languages and debuggers are verified to work with this extension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other languages and debuggers might work too. For languages with &lt;em&gt;Rudimentary Support&lt;/em&gt;, only JSON strings can be visualized - you must implement some logic that builds this JSON for your data structure! Fully supported languages offer &lt;em&gt;Data Extractors&lt;/em&gt; which convert some well known data structures to json.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing this extension, use the command &lt;code&gt;Debug Visualizer: New View&lt;/code&gt; to open a new visualizer view. In this view you can enter an expression that is evaluated and visualized while stepping through your application. This view works the same as the watch view of VS Code, except that the resulting value is presented visually rather than textually and you can only watch one expression (but you can still open multiple windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the command &lt;code&gt;Debug Visualizer: Use Selection as Expression&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Shift + F1)&lt;/em&gt; to use the currently selected text as expression in the most recently opened debug visualizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supported Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all values can be processed. Visualizers consume specific JSON data. This extension uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/visualization&quot;&gt;hediet/visualization&lt;/a&gt;, a generic visualization framework. You can see in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://hediet.github.io/visualization/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt; which data can be visualized and how the visualization looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currently watched expression should evaluate to a JSON Object string, matching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hediet.github.io/visualization/docs/visualization-data-schema.json&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt; of one of the supported visualizers. This JSON string may be surrounded by single or double quotation marks (or none at all) and must not be escaped. A valid example is &lt;code&gt;&quot;{ &quot;kind&quot;: { &quot;text&quot;: true }, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;some text\nmore text&quot; }&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Use the watch window to see what an expression evaluates to. This extension simply interprets that result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some languages (TypeScript/JavaScript), runtime code is injected to support &lt;em&gt;Data Extractors&lt;/em&gt;. A Data Extractor lifts the requirement for the visualized value to be a JSON string and acts as a bridge between custom data structures and the JSON data processed by the visualizers. When multiple Data Extractors are applicable, a preferred one can be selected in the visualization view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hediet.github.io/visualization/docs/visualization-data-schema.json&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JSON Schema for all supported visualizations&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hediet.github.io/visualization/docs/visualization-data.ts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;typescript declaration file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selected Demos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reversing a Doubly Linked List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/doubly-linked-list-reverse-demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/doubly-linked-list-reverse-demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random Walk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/visualization-plotly-random-walk.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/visualization-plotly-random-walk.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ast Visualizer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/ast-demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/ast-demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Table Visualizer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/table-demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/table-demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JavaScript/TypeScript Integrated Data Extractors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data extractors convert arbitrary values into data consumable by visualizers. They live in the debugee. The following data extractors are injected automatically into the debugee by this extension when using the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;node2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;extensionHost&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chrome&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pwa-chrome&lt;/code&gt; debug adapter. Custom data extractors can be registered too. See the package &lt;code&gt;@hediet/debug-visualizer-data-extraction&lt;/code&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/data-extraction/README.md&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; for the implementation and its API. Also, a global object of name &lt;code&gt;hedietDbgVis&lt;/code&gt; with helper functions is injected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ToString&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just calls &lt;code&gt;.toString()&lt;/code&gt; on values and treats the result as text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TypeScript AST&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct Visualization of &lt;code&gt;ts.Node&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization of &lt;code&gt;Record&amp;lt;string, ts.Node&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ts.Node[]&lt;/code&gt;. If the record contains a key &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt;, its value is displayed for each node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Is Data Extractor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treats the data as direct input to the visualizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Method 'getVisualizationData'&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calls &lt;code&gt;.getVisualizationData()&lt;/code&gt; on values and treats the result as direct input to the visualizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plotly y-Values&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses plotly to plot an array of numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object Graph&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constructs a graph containing all objects reachable from object the expression evaluates to. Graph is constructed using a breadth search. Stops after 50 nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array Grid&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creates Grid visualization data for an array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UI Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-line Expressions&lt;/strong&gt;: Press &lt;code&gt;shift+enter&lt;/code&gt; to add a new line and &lt;code&gt;ctrl+enter&lt;/code&gt; to evaluate the expression. When only having a single line, &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; submits the current expression, but when having multiple lines, &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; inserts another line break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/blob/master/docs/multiline-expression.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/vscode-debug-visualizer/raw/master/docs/multiline-expression.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension provides these configuration options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;debugVisualizer.debugAdapterConfigurations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows to set expression templates for specific debug adapter types. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;debugVisualizer.debugAdapterConfigurations&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;lldb&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: {
                &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;expressionTemplate&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;script to_json(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;${expr}&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
                &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;repl&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configurations here overwrite the built-in support for the corresponding debug adapter type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;debugVisualizer.useChromeKioskMode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifies whether to pop out Debug Visualization Views with Chrome in Kiosk Mode. Uses the default browser otherwise or if Chrome is not found. Defaults to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension works very well together with my library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hediet/node-reload&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@hediet/node-reload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for TypeScript/JavaScript. Together, they provide an interactive playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ping me on GitHub by opening an issue! Having runtime infrastructures for languages other than JavaScript would be awesome and I happily accept PRs!&lt;/p&gt;

The willingness of people to draw instant parallels between software (&quot;FOR ANY PURPOSE&quot;) and the beliefs and moral values of the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, large swathes of the fediverse have written off pleroma and pleroma users as undesirable, regardless of whether that was true or not, because of a small element who were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has now decided that fediverse apps, it seems, are likewise undesirable because of a small number of non-representative users. First we have sown, now we reap.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Attached: 1 image Holy crap, google is apparently taking down all/most fediverse apps from google play on the grounds that that some servers in the fediverse engage in hate speech. At least three apps I know of anyway and I'd imagine the others will follow soon under the exact same reasoning.} Seems to be the case with Husky, Fedilab, and &quot;subway&quot; tooter. this is a scary precedent if google play is going to ban any apps that can in any way be used to access content with hate speech. So what about a forum client, do they take that down just because there is a forum somewhere on the internet posting hate speech? This is particularly worrisome because for most people Google Play is the only way they understand to install apps at all.

<title>Ham radio is not dying, it&amp;#039;s evolving</title>
<link>http://k0lwc.com/ham-radio-is-dying-no-its-not-its-evolving/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://k0lwc.com/ham-radio-is-dying-no-its-not-its-evolving/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ham radio licensees are increasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-125&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; height=&quot;447&quot; srcset=&quot;http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The economic collapse of 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…&lt;em&gt;communications equipment&lt;/em&gt;. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FT8/JS8Call&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;FT8/JS8Call&lt;/a&gt; has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Digital Mobile Radio&lt;/a&gt; has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use &lt;a href=&quot;http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Internet-connected hotspots&lt;/a&gt; to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting young kids involved in ham radio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.remotehamradio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Remote Ham Radio&lt;/a&gt; as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;They offer a program where kids can win free time&lt;/a&gt; using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be 25 years old or younger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a General class or higher license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a member of the ARRL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ham radio has evolved&lt;/strong&gt;, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

<title>One Year with ThinkPad and Linux (From MacBook Pro)</title>
<link>https://drikerf.com/one-year-with-thinkpad-and-linux-from-macbook-pro/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drikerf.com/one-year-with-thinkpad-and-linux-from-macbook-pro/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts about my experiences switching from Mac to a ThinkPad with Linux the past year. For context, I'm the founder and maker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wobaka.com&quot;&gt;Wobaka.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bootstrap.email&quot;&gt;Bootstrap.email&lt;/a&gt;. I work with front/backend development, design, marketing and sales every day. I code primarily in Clojure + ClojureScript but I also do some JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, Python and Bash on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post for my past and future self. I was looking for something like this last year but couldn't find much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;past-experience&quot;&gt;Past experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up I used Windows and later on Linux (Slackware!). I started using Macs around 2009. So it's been roughly 10 years straight in Apple land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ThinkPad T480 (14&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora Linux with Gnome, and sometimes i3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editor: Emacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal: Gnome, and sometimes urxvt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell: Bash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brower: Firefox, and sometimes Chromium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://drikerf.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-19-17-10-37.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Neofetch dump&lt;img src=&quot;https://drikerf.com/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-28-14-13-19.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Desktop environment
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-been-working-great&quot;&gt;What's been working great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a really solid machine. Especially for development work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More performance for the $.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control over the environment, like &lt;code&gt;/ls/proc/&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs and programs in general feels snappier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can disable webcam in BIOS when not used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ports: USB-C, USB and SD card reader (for DSLR camera)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance: T480 is not slim and this is for the better. I can replace/upgrade most components by myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thermodynamics: There's a proper fan and heatsink on this one. Fan rarely spins loudly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-hasn-t&quot;&gt;What hasn't&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battery time is not like Macs. ~ 5 hours (after one year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't debug issues in Safari without borrowing a Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't do iOS development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a VM with Windows to sync my Suunto GPS watch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touchpad is not close to Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emoji support is not 100%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some video conference tools can be a bit glitchy until you get the setup right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnome Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Todoist (Homemade Electron wrapper but I believe they're working on Linux release)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peek (GIF recording)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kdenlive (Video editing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP (Photo editing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darktable (RAW Photo editing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FFMPEG (Converting videos etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ImageMagick (Converting and resizing images)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice (Spreadsheets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitwarden (Password manager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evince (PDF reading and annotating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify (Music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram (Messaging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution (Mail, Calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geary (Lightweight mail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gnome Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general I think I've found a worthy replacement for every essential tool that I used on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;staying-with-linux&quot;&gt;Staying with Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. It took a few weeks of tinkering but now I feel at home. Only reason to buy a Mac would be if I needed to work on an iOS/macOS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got questions? I'm on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drikerf&quot;&gt;@drikerf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China Built a Vast New Infrastructure to Imprison Uighurs</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This is Part 1 of a BuzzFeed News investigation. For Part 2, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/china-ex-prisoners-horrors-xinjiang-camps-uighurs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This project was supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opentech.fund/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Technology Fund&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulitzercenter.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pulitzer Center&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eyebeam.org/eyebeam-center-for-the-future-of-journalism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eyebeam Center for the Future of Journalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;China has secretly built&lt;/b&gt; scores of massive new prison and internment camps in the past three years, dramatically escalating its campaign against Muslim minorities even as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/27f00e4feaa2755f25ab514cecda7add&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly claimed the detainees had all been set free&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of these purpose-built, high-security camps — some capable of housing tens of thousands of people — signals a radical shift away from the country’s previous makeshift use of public buildings, like schools and retirement homes, to a vast and permanent infrastructure for mass detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most extensive investigation of China’s internment camp system ever done using publicly available satellite images, coupled with dozens of interviews with former detainees, BuzzFeed News identified more than 260 structures built since 2017 and bearing the hallmarks of fortified detention compounds. There is at least one in nearly every county in the far-west region of Xinjiang. During that time, the investigation shows, China has established a sprawling system to detain and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities, in what is already the largest-scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These forbidding facilities — including several built or significantly expanded within the last year — are part of the government’s unprecedented campaign of mass detention of more than a million people, which began in late 2016. That year Chen Quanguo, the region’s top official and Communist Party boss, whom the US &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/10/us-imposes-sanctions-on-senior-chinese-officials-over-uighur-abuses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently sanctioned&lt;/a&gt; over human rights abuses, also put Muslim minorities — more than half the region’s population of about 25 million — under perpetual surveillance via facial recognition cameras, cellphone tracking, checkpoints, and heavy-handed human policing. They are also subject to many other abuses, ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sterilization&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/fashion/uighur-forced-labor-cotton-fashion.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To detain thousands of people in short order, the government repurposed old schools and other buildings. Then, as the number of detainees swelled, in 2018 the government began building new facilities with far greater security measures and more permanent architectural features, such as heavy concrete walls and guard towers, the BuzzFeed News analysis shows. Prisons often take years to build, but some of these new compounds took less than six months, according to historical satellite data. The government has also added more factories within camp and prison compounds during that time, suggesting the expansion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/fashion/uighur-forced-labor-cotton-fashion.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt; within the region. Construction was still ongoing as of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are living in horror in these places,” said 49-year-old Zhenishan Berdibek, who was detained in a camp in the Tacheng region for much of 2018. “Some of the younger people were not as tolerant as us — they cried and screamed and shouted.” But Berdibek, a cancer survivor, couldn’t muster the energy. As she watched the younger women get dragged away to solitary confinement, “I lost my hope,” she said. “I wanted to die inside the camp.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News identified 268 newly built compounds by cross-referencing blanked-out areas on Baidu Maps — a Google Maps–like tool that’s widely used in China — with images from external satellite data providers. These compounds often contained multiple detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-two of these facilities have been identified or verified as detention centers by other sources, such as government procurement documents, academic research, or, in 19 cases, visits by journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 176 facilities have been established by satellite imagery alone. The images frequently show thick walls at the perimeter, and often, barbed wire fencing that creates pens and corridors in the courtyards. Many compounds in the region are walled, but the facilities identified by BuzzFeed News have much heavier fortifications. At 121 of these compounds, they also show guard towers, often built into the perimeter wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a detailed list of questions about this article as well as a list of GPS coordinates of facilities identified in this article, the Chinese Consulate in New York said “the issue concerning Xinjiang is by no means about human rights, religion or ethnicity, but about combating violent terrorism and separatism,” adding that it was a “groundless lie” that a million Uighurs have been detained in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Xinjiang has set up vocational education and training centers in order to root out extreme thoughts, enhance the rule of law awareness through education, improve vocational skills and create employment opportunities for them, so that those affected by extreme and violent ideas can return to society as soon as possible,” the consulate added, saying human rights are protected in the centers and that “trainees have freedom of movement.” But it also compared its program to “compulsory programs for terrorist criminals” it said are taking place in other countries including the US and UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's Foreign Ministry and Baidu did not respond to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new facilities are scattered across every populated area of the region, and several are large enough to accommodate 10,000 prisoners at a minimum, based on their size and architectural features. (One of the reporters on this story is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://architects-register.org.uk/search/name/Killing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archoutloud.com/alison-killing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike early sites, the new facilities appear more permanent and prisonlike, similar in construction to high-security prisons in other parts of China. The most highly fortified compounds offer little space between buildings, tiny concrete-walled yards, heavy masonry construction, and long networks of corridors with cells down either side. Their layouts are cavernous, allowing little natural light to the interior of the buildings. BuzzFeed News could see how rooms were laid out at some high-security facilities by examining historical satellite photos taken as they were being constructed, including photos of buildings without roofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With at least tens of thousands of detainees crowded into government buildings repurposed as camps by the end of 2017, the government began building the largest new facilities in the spring of 2018. Several were complete by October 2018, with further facilities built through 2019 and construction of a handful more continuing even now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has said its camps are schools and vocational training centers where detainees are “deradicalized.” The government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XofQjW2wyg?amp=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own internal documentation&lt;/a&gt; about its policies in Xinjiang has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GroseTimothy/status/997823497815691267&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;used the term&lt;/a&gt; “concentration,” or 集中, to describe “educational schools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government claims that its campaign combats extremism in the region. But most who end up in these facilities are not extremists of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downloading WhatsApp, which is banned in China, maintaining ties with family abroad, engaging in prayer, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51520622&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;visiting a foreign website&lt;/a&gt; are all offenses for which Muslims have been sent to camps, according to previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/e0224416-4e77-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaked documents&lt;/a&gt; and interviews with former detainees. Because the government does not consider internment camps to be part of the criminal justice system and none of these behaviors are crimes under Chinese law, no detainees have been formally arrested or charged with a crime, let alone seen a day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compounds BuzzFeed News identified likely include extrajudicial internment camps — which hold people who are not suspected of any crime — as well as prisons. Both types of facilities have security features that closely resemble each other. Xinjiang’s prison population has grown massively during the government’s campaign: In 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/world/asia/xinjiang-china-uighurs-prisons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the region had 21% of all arrests in China&lt;/a&gt;, despite making up less than 2% of the national population — an eightfold increase from the year before, according to a New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/world/asia/xinjiang-china-uighurs-prisons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of government data. Because China’s Communist Party–controlled courts have a more than 99% conviction rate, the overwhelming majority of those arrests likely resulted in convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People detained in the camps told BuzzFeed News they were subjected to torture, hunger, overcrowding, solitary confinement, forced birth control, and a range of other abuses. They said they were put through brainwashing programs focusing on Communist Party propaganda and made to speak only in the Chinese language. Some former detainees said they were forced to labor without pay in factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government heavily restricts the movements of independent journalists and researchers in the region, and heavily censors the internet and its own domestic media. Muslim minorities can be punished for posts on social media. But satellite images that are collected from independent providers remain outside the scope of Chinese government censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other kinds of evidence have also occasionally leaked out. In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGYoeJ5U7cQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a drone video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/06/asia/china-xinjiang-video-intl-hnk/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerged&lt;/a&gt; showing hundreds of blindfolded men with their heads shaven and their arms tied behind their backs, wearing vests that say “Kashgar Detention Center.” Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who has done extensive satellite imagery analysis of the detention and prison systems in Xinjiang, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1175353408749891584?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the video shows a prisoner transfer that took place in April 2019 — months after the government first said the system was for vocational training. Previous analyses, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-xinjiangs-re-education-camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;including by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt; in November 2018, identified several dozen early camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The internment and assimilation program in Xinjiang has the overall logic of colonial genocides in North America, the formalized racism of apartheid, the industrial-scale internment of Germany's concentration camps, and the police-state penetration into everyday life of North Korea,” said Rian Thum, a scholar of the history of Islam in China at the University of Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign has done deep damage to many Muslim minority groups — but especially Uighurs, who are by far the most populous ethnic minority group in Xinjiang and do not have ties to any other country. The Chinese government has heavily penalized expressions of Turkic minority culture, from Kazakh- and Uighur-language education to the practice of Islam outside of state-controlled mosques. This, combined with forced sterilizations, has led some critics to say that the campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/whats-happening-in-xinjiang-is-genocide/2020/07/06/cde3f9da-bfaa-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;qualifies as genocide under international law&lt;/a&gt;. The Trump administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/trump-administration-china-genocide-uighurs-401581&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is reportedly discussing&lt;/a&gt; whether to formally call it a genocide, and a spokesperson for Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, said on Tuesday that Biden supports the label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are peaceful people in concentration camps,” said Abduweli Ayup, a Uighur linguist who was jailed and later exiled from Xinjiang after opening kindergartens that taught Uighur children in their own language. “They are businessmen and scholars and engineers. They are our musicians. They are doctors. They are shopkeepers, restaurant owners, teachers who used Uighur textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the pillars of our society. Without them, we cannot exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The position of Muslim minorities&lt;/b&gt;, particularly Uighurs, in China has been fraught since the Communist Party came to power in 1949. But conditions deteriorated quickly starting in 2016, when the government implemented a system of heavy-handed surveillance and policing as a means to push Muslims into a growing internment camp system for “transformation through education.” Chen, the region’s party boss, called on officials to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;round up everyone who should be rounded up&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands were. Tursunay Ziyawudun, who was detained in March 2018, was one of them. When she arrived at the camp’s gates, she saw hundreds of people around her removing their jewelry, shoelaces, and belts. They were being “processed,” she said, to enter the camp through a security checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, the government remade schools, retirement homes, hospitals, and other public buildings into internment camps. There were other, older detention centers available too — BuzzFeed News identified 47 built before 2017 that have been used to lock people up in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some detention facilities are geared toward releasing detainees after several months; in others, detainees may be sentenced to prison terms, said Adrian Zenz, a leading researcher on the abuses in Xinjiang. Three former detainees interviewed by BuzzFeed News said they were held for months in detention without any charges against them — far longer than is allowed by law — before they were transferred to internment camps. The detentions picked up speed in 2017, and numbers in the camps quickly swelled until the inmates were living on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News interviewed 28 former detainees from the region, many of whom described being blindfolded and handcuffed, much like the men shown in the video. Many spoke through an interpreter. They are among a tiny minority of former detainees who were released and left the country — but they described a brutal system that they saw growing and changing with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recalled being frequently moved from camp to camp — a tactic that many believed was meant to combat overcrowding in the first generation of makeshift facilities. At the beginning of the campaign, hundreds of people were arriving on a daily basis. New batches of detainees always seemed to be coming and going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some former detainees described sleeping two to a twin bed, or even sleeping in shifts when there was not enough room to house all the detainees. Almost all said they received meager quantities of rice, steamed buns, and porridge, and little or no meat or other protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orynbek Koksebek, a 40-year-old ethnic Kazakh, was first detained relatively early in the campaign, around the end of 2017. At first, he slept in a room with seven other men, and everyone had a bed to themselves. But within a few months, he began to notice more and more people arriving. “One day I saw a pregnant woman in shackles,” he said. “Another woman had a baby in her arms, she was breastfeeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By February 2018, there were 15 men in his room, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of us had to share blankets or sleep on the floor,” he said. “They told us later that some of us would be given prison sentences or transferred to other camps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camp officials regularly forced detainees to memorize Communist Party propaganda and Chinese characters in classrooms. But some former detainees said their facilities were too crowded for even this — instead, they had to sit on plastic stools next to their beds and stare at textbooks, sitting with their backs perfectly straight while cameras monitored them. Camp guards told them there were too many people to fit in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Koksebek, the claustrophobia was unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a window in our room, but it was so high I couldn’t see much other than a patch of sky,” he said. “I used to wish I were a bird so I could have the freedom to fly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On a frigid, overcast morning&lt;/b&gt; last December, Shohrat Zakir, the region’s governor and second-most-powerful official, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-12/09/content_5459657.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gave a rare press conference&lt;/a&gt; at China’s State Council Information Office, located in a closed compound in central Beijing. The office is one of only a handful of government bodies in China that regularly briefs both local and international journalists, and Zakir sat with four other officials at a long podium at the front of the small room. The officials took the opportunity to tout the region’s economic growth and claim China’s campaign against terrorism in Xinjiang has been a success, calling the US government hypocritical for its criticism of China’s human rights abuses. But Zakir was the one who made international headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those held in the camps as “trainees,” Zakir painted a rosy picture. They “have all graduated, and have realized stable employment with the government’s help, improved their quality of life, and are enjoying a happy life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as reporters were scribbling down his remarks, about 2,500 miles away in Xinjiang, construction was wrapping up on a massive high-security compound near the Uighur heartland county of Shufu, just south of a winding river that flows through a countryside dotted by livestock farms. Shufu is small by Chinese standards, with a population of about 300,000 people. It has a main drag with a post office, a lottery ticket vendor, and eateries selling steamed buns and beef noodle soup. The camp was built on farmland less than a 20-minute drive away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before workers started construction last March, the land beneath the Shufu site was farmland too, blanketed with green vegetation. By August, workers had built a thick perimeter enclosure, with guard towers looming in the corners and in the center of walls that rise nearly 6 meters, or more than 19 feet, satellite images show. Next came the buildings inside, organized in U-shaped groups, with two five-story structures alongside a two-story one forming the base of the U. By October, two rows of barbed wire fencing appeared on either side of the main concrete-walled compound, its shadow visible in satellite images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just outside the walls, on the western side of the compound, two guard buildings were built — distinguished by the narrow walled pathways leading from them up to the wall that would allow guards to access the guard towers and the tops of the walls for patrols. In front of the entrance, a series of buildings provided space for prison offices and police buildings. In total BuzzFeed News estimates that there is room for approximately 10,500 prisoners at this compound — which would help provide a long-term solution to overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      “I wasn’t happy or sad. I couldn’t feel anything. Even when I was reunited with my relatives in Kazakhstan, they asked me why I didn’t seem happy to see them after so long.”

&lt;p&gt;Ruser reviewed satellite images of the compound and said it was a newly built detention camp. “The vast majority of camps have watchtowers, internal fencing, and a strong external wall entranceway or exit,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the old, repurposed camps, new prisons and camps such as this one have higher security, with gates up to four stories tall and thicker walls along their borders, often with further layers of barbed wire on either side of the main walls. These features suggest they are capable of holding much larger groups of people in long-term detention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camps can contain not only cells where detainees sleep, but also classrooms, clinics, canteens, stand-alone shower facilities, solitary confinement rooms, police buildings, administrative offices, and small visitor centers, former detainees told BuzzFeed News. Many of the compounds also contain factories, distinguished by their blue, powder-coated metal roofs and steel frames, which are visible in satellite photos taken while they were being constructed. The police buildings, including for guards and administrative personnel, are usually located by the entrances of the compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locations of these camps and prisons in Xinjiang are not readily available. However, blanked-out portions of maps on China's Baidu make it possible to use satellite imagery to find and analyze them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satellite maps, like Google Earth, are made up of a grid of rectangular tiles. On Baidu, the Chinese search giant that has a map service much like Google’s, BuzzFeed News discovered that spaces containing camps, military bases, or other politically sensitive facilities were overlaid with plain light gray tiles. These “mask” tiles appeared upon zooming in on the location. These look different from the darker gray, watermarked tiles that appear when Baidu cannot load something. The “mask” tiles were also present at other locations where camps had been visited and verified by journalists, though they have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News identified the compounds using other satellite maps — provided by Google Earth, Planet Labs, and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel Hub — which do not mask those images. For some locations where high-resolution images were not publicly available, Planet Labs used its own satellite to take new pictures, then provided them to BuzzFeed News. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/satellite-images-investigation-xinjiang-detention-camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt; about how this investigation was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images showed the facilities being built over a period of months. Details from the images offer a sense of size and scale: Counting the number of windows in building facades, for example, shows how many stories they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, these compounds were built next door to an older prison, sharing parking lots, administrative facilities, and police barracks with the older facility, satellite images show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News found an additional 50 more compounds that were likely used for internment in the past but have lost some security features, including barbed wire fencing within compounds used to create rectangular pens, closed passages between buildings, and guard towers, with a small number having been demolished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruser and other experts said this does not suggest the Chinese government is pulling back from its campaign. Many of those facilities likely still operate as low-security camps, he said. The far more important trend in Xinjiang, he said, is the government’s increased use of higher-security prisons and detention facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions, the Chinese Consulate in New York echoed Zakir's December statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All trainees who received courses in standard spoken and written Chinese, understanding of the law, vocational skills, and deradicalization have completed their training, secured stable employment in the society, and are living a normal life,&quot; it said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All of the detainees interviewed&lt;/b&gt; by BuzzFeed News were released too long ago to have spent any time in one of the brand-new facilities — many said that before they escaped China for good, they were kept under de facto house or town arrest, unable to venture past the borders of their villages without obtaining permission from a police officer. Many — especially those with less formal education — had no idea what type of facility they were held in or even why they had been detained in the first place. They said they often drew conclusions based on weekly interrogation sessions, where police asked about actions that made them “untrustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An older ethnic Kazakh man named Nurlan Kokteubai recognized the camp he was taken to as soon as he arrived in September 2017. Not long before, it had been a middle school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My daughter went to that school,” he said. “I had picked her up there before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smile lines appear on Kokteubai’s deeply wrinkled face when he talks about his daughter, who was born in 1992. She later moved to Kazakhstan, where many ethnic Kazakhs from China emigrate because of the Kazakh government’s resettlement policy for people of Kazakh descent. There, she and her husband campaigned relentlessly for Kokteubai’s release in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kELJhpy-i_o&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu9g39sZkTQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; and long letters to human rights groups. He believes his eventual release in March 2018 was due to her campaign. Inside the camp, instead of classrooms where students like his daughter might have studied math or history, Kokteubai saw dorm rooms overcrowded with as many as 40 or 50 men each sleeping on too few bunk beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the compound itself wasn’t new, it had many updated features, such as high walls and barbed wire around the compound. And the camp was now dotted with CCTV cameras, which a guard told him could film objects as far as 200 meters away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was new: When you entered the gate, a huge red plaque greeted you. “Let’s learn the spirit of the 19th Communist Party Congress,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Kokteubai, several former detainees interviewed by BuzzFeed News said after arriving, they recognized the facilities in which they were held because they had walked or driven past them, or even visited them in their previous incarnations. But these repurposed facilities were never meant to house prisoners and were not big enough to hold all the Muslim minorities the Chinese government intended to detain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2019, workers started clearing land to expand a camp south of Ürümqi, in a town called Dabancheng, that had become infamous after reporters from BBC and Reuters visited the year before. The camp at Dabancheng was already one of the largest internment facilities in the region, capable in October 2018 of housing up to 32,500 people, according to an architectural analysis by BuzzFeed News. Since the expansion, it is now capable of housing some 10,000 more people. By November of last year another, separate compound had been completed, this one capable of holding a further 10,000 people — for a total capacity of more than 40,000, comparable to the size of the town of Niagara Falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These facilities display characteristics consistent with extrajudicial detention facilities in the Xinjiang region that CSIS has previously analyzed,&quot; said Amy Lehr, director of the human rights program at Washington DC-based think tank CSIS after examining the three camps referenced in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp at Dabancheng, Ruser said, “is the main catchment camp for Ürümqi. It’s 2 km (1.2 miles) long and was expanded late last year an extra kilometer with a new facility across the road to the west.” By comparison, the camp is about half the length of Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokteubai never found out precisely why he was detained. Because he’s ethnic Kazakh, he was eventually able to settle in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day he was released, he expected to feel joy, relief, something. Instead he felt nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t happy or sad. I couldn’t feel anything,” he said. “Even when I was reunited with my relatives in Kazakhstan, they asked me why I didn’t seem happy to see them after so long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s something I can’t explain,” he said. “It’s like my feelings died while I was in there.” ●&lt;/p&gt;
