<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON—Both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general are likely to file antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc.’s Google—and are well into planning for litigation, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, some of the people said. At least some state attorneys general—led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican—are likely to file a case, probably in the fall, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;...

<description>&lt;p&gt;A Google search, at one time, could locate a news article on a man accused of attempted child rape, another on someone charged with fraud and still others on Ukrainian politicians facing corruption allegations. Googling certain keywords in March would find an article detailing the movements of two coronavirus-infected British tourists in Vietnam and warning others who visited the same places to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then the stories vanished.&lt;/p&gt;...

<og:title>Google Hides News, Tricked by Fake Claims</og:title>
<og:description>A Wall Street Journal investigation shows how dubious copyright complaints citing 1998 law led the search giant to make unfavorable articles vanish. “We worked hard to reveal corruption,” says an editor whose work disappeared, “but Google corporation can easily ban our story.”</og:description>

<title>A small restaurant owner on Google, DoorDash, and Grubhub</title>

<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;DoorDash &amp;amp; GrubHub charge restaurants an advertising fee and then use that money to pay Google to run advertisements that use our restaurant’s brand name to divert customers away from our website to our competitors on their platform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;My name is Travis Stoliker and I’m a small restaurant owner in Lansing Michigan. Owning two small BBQ restaurants in a small town is an incredibly difficult business. Everyone knows that owning a restaurant, in general, is tough.  But it gets even harder when two of the largest companies in the world conspire against you to steal your customers.  This might seem like hyperbole. But give me a moment to let me explain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most consumers don’t realize this, but when you order delivery from one of the large delivery partners like GrubHub or DoorDash - not only do you pay a delivery fee, service fee, and a generous tip to the driver. But we restaurant owners also pay.  The delivery companies don’t like us to talk about the fee’s but it has been well reported elsewhere that these fees can range from 15% to 35% of your entire order.  So if you order $10 of food from us.  The delivery company usually takes about $3 of it and only gives the restaurant $7.  For an industry with notoriously slim profit margins, that percentage is painful.  That does _not_ include all of the delivery fees, taxes, service fees, and tips that you might pay on top of that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The justification that the delivery companies give to the restaurant for why we would agree to something this crazy is that they call it an “advertising fee”.  How they justify this huge cost is by saying that their platforms are so large and there are so many people searching for food on their platforms, that our restaurants benefit because the delivery platforms are bringing us new customers that have never heard of our restaurants. And of course, that’s what us Restaurant owners are always looking for -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;New Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;That all sounds good if it were the case, but unfortunately, it is not the case at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; DoorDash &amp;amp; GrubHub’s relationship with Google is a perfect example.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our small BBQ Restaurants (Saddleback BBQ) are located in the small town of Lansing Michigan.  If a person in Lansing goes onto Google search to look for directions to our location and types into the Google search bar (or their browser) ‘Saddleback BBQ Lansing’.  DoorDash &amp;amp; Google conspire to take that customer and direct them to DoorDash.  You’ll notice a few things about this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “Advertisement” is much larger than our own “order” button where someone can order directly from our website or get directions to our location. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;DoorDash uses our brand name “Saddleback BBQ” right in the advertisement.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Applebees. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6KsGyAeFFfeliOLsLJzPQf5o1oMHv15IMMvcE08q7-mg-m1UvEaO0pSNB54FQzr1gG81H9vYiUqIMnRVAEZNnfErgGGgcdvTSFPjyVUKe9WPUvBMpCEbvwvjT8c4pFbwcRgB3MI3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From there a customer can purchase from any BBQ restaurant in Lansing or if the customer chooses to order from us we must pay DoorDash a fee for bringing us that customer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I want to be very clear, the problem is NOT that we are paying them for their services. The problem is that they are actively using our brand name to advertise to customers that are already looking for us. They are redirecting those customers to their platform where they can purchase from a competitor or they can charge us a fee to provide food to that same customer.  Whereas the customer could have just gone to our website and ordered directly from our online ordering store and we would not be charged a commission to GrubHub or DoorDash. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c7fdad4d-7fff-601d-f946-2e6b94faea08&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being that we are partners of DoorDash and GrubHub, I have personally reached out to them multiple times.  I’ve spent hours on the phone with each of them to get them to stop this practice.  For a while, they stop, but then, they start up again.  Which they both just did recently.  Our only recourse is to immediately terminate our contract with GrubHub and DoorDash, which we are considering doing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We don’t know.  I doubt it, but we will find out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;After testing the waters this spring with its incubator-esque MVP Lab, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/mozilla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; is doubling down on the effort with &lt;a href=&quot;https://builders.mozilla.community/&quot;&gt;a formal program dangling $75,000 investments in front of early-stage companies&lt;/a&gt;. The focus on “a better society” and the company’s open-source clout should help differentiate it from the other options out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spurred on by the success of a college hackathon using a whole four Apple Watches in February, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/mozilla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;mozilla&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; decided to try a more structured program in the spring. The first test batch of companies is underway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://builders.mozilla.community/springlab/index.html&quot;&gt;having started in April an 8-week program&lt;/a&gt; offering $2,500 per team member and $40,000 in prizes to give away at the end. Developers in a variety of domains were invited to apply, as long as they fit the themes of empowerment, privacy, decentralization, community and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It drew the interest of some 1,500 people in 520 projects, and 25 were chosen to receive the full package and stipend during the development of their MVP. The rest were invited to an “Open Lab” with access to some of Mozilla’s resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1988953 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-logo.png?resize=50,28 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of what they were looking for is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/ameelio-wants-to-take-on-for-profit-prison-calling-rackets-after-starting-with-free-letters-to-inmates/&quot;&gt;Ameelio&lt;/a&gt;, a startup whose members are hoping to render paid video calls in prisons obsolete with a free system, and provide free letter delivery to inmates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The mission of this incubator is to catalyze a new generation of internet products and services where the people are in control of how the internet is used to shape society,” said &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/bart-decrem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;bart-decrem&quot;&gt;Bart Decrem,&lt;/a&gt; a Mozilla veteran (think Firefox 1.0) and one of the principals at the Builders Studio. “And where business models should be sustainable and valuable, but do not need to squeeze every last dollar (or ounce of attention) from the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We think we are tapping into the energy in the student and professional ‘builder communities’ around wanting to work on ideas that matter. That clarion call really resonates,” he said. Not only that, but students with canceled internships are showing up in droves, it seems — mostly computer science, but design and other disciplines as well. There are no restrictions on applicants, like country of origin, previous funding, or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new incubator will be divided into three tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is the “Startup Studio,” which involves a $75,000 investment, “a post-money SAFE for 3.5% of the company when the SAFE converts (or we will participate in an already active funding round),” Decrem clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below that, as far as pecuniary commitment goes, is the “MVP Lab,” similar to the spring program but offering a total of $16,000 per team. And below that is the Open Lab again, but with 10 $10,000 prizes rather than a top 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no hard numbers on how many teams will make up the two subsidized tiers, but think 20-30 total as opposed to 50 or 100. Meanwhile, collaboration, cross-pollination and open-source code is encouraged, as you might expect in a Mozilla project. And the social good aspect is strong as well, as a sampling of the companies in the spring batch shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1988952&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png 2105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=1536,872 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=2048,1163 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.moz_neutral_Mock.png?resize=50,28 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutral is a browser plugin that shows the carbon footprint of your &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; purchases, adding some crucial guilt to transactions we forget are powered by footsore humans and gas-guzzling long-distance goods transport. Meething, Cabal and Oasis are taking on video conferencing, team chat and social feeds from a decentralized standpoint, using the miracles of modern internet architecture to accomplish with distributed systems what once took centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer will see the program inaugurated, but it’s only “the beginning of a multiyear effort,” Decrem said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Our Chrome Extension Is Safe</title>
<link>https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/15/our-extension-is-safe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/15/our-extension-is-safe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a follow-up to Wednesday’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/&quot;&gt;Let’s Guess What Google Requires In 14 Days Or They Kill Our Extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the good news out there right away. Our extension has been approved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;FYI the latest submission has been approved. Apologies to Pushbullet for the rejection after addressed the original violation &amp;amp; to the broader dev community for not providing more actionable rejections 🙇&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/b7Au7Mjppn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/b7Au7Mjppn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Simeon.__proto__ (@DotProto) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DotProto/status/1261047663669084161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those worried about losing Pushbullet’s functionality (and for us worried about losing our extension), things are back to normal now. This is great news and we are happy to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We hope the attention our previous post received results in better feedback for other extension developers that may be struggling with similar vague feedback from Google.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t expect anywhere near the level of attention our previous post received. All of that attention resulted in our issue being resolved. This is good for us. It is not yet clear if the attention will help other developers that are struggling with similar vague rejections. We hope it does help though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great outcome would be if the current Chrome extension review and feedback process was revisited as a result of the criticism the current process has received. This would mean the outpouring of support we received benefits all extension developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe @DotProto and others at Google when they express their desire to improve the feedback extension developers are provided. I hope the overwhelming community support that has been shown will give them the influence they need to push for steps in a better direction.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US video game sales have record quarter as consumers stay at home</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/us-video-game-sales-have-record-quarter-as-consumers-stay-at-home/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/us-video-game-sales-have-record-quarter-as-consumers-stay-at-home/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;New numbers from NPD confirm what we’ve known for a while: The first quarter of 2020 was a very good one for gaming companies. The new report notes that sales hit a record $10.86 billion in the States between January and March of this year, marking a 9% increase over a year prior; $9.58 billion of that figure was from video game content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The primary driver is, you guessed it, COVID-19. As stay at home orders have been enacted on the federal and state levels, people are coping with the ongoing daily horror that is life in 2020 by playing video games. Lots and lots of video games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Here’s NPD’s Mat Piscatella further confirming our suspicions: “Video Games have brought comfort and connection to millions during this challenging time. As people have stayed at home more, they’ve utilized gaming not only as a diversion and an escape, but also as a means of staying connected with family and friends. Whether it was on console or mobile, PC or virtual reality, gaming experienced play and sales growth during the first quarter.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.7807570977918&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;11.091482649842&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;According to NPD's Q1 2020 Games Market Dynamics: U.S. report, overall total industry consumer spending on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/videogaming?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#videogaming&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. reached a record $10.86 billion in the first quarter of 2020 (Jan. – Mar.), an increase of 9 percent compared to the same time period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— NPD Games (@npdgames) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/npdgames/status/1261261525941174273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;That last bit is, in part, key to many consumers’ choice of game titles. As already noted by the firm, Animal Crossing: New Horizons had its own record-setting first quarter. That, in turn, helped drive Switch sales, in spite of Nintendo’s well-documented supply issues. The title arrived just in the nick of time for stay at home orders in the U.S., delivering a kind of front-facing social experience that much of the competition lacks. Also, turnips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Matter of fact, the Switch’s success actually helped supplement losses of other platforms. Microsoft and Sony will no doubt make up gains at the end of the year with their next-gen consoles. For now, however, many consumers are likely holding out until their holiday arrives to invest in Xbox or PlayStation hardware, in spite of the pandemic. The U.S.’s soaring unemployment rate no doubt also had an impact on the industry’s bottom line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/pages/covid-19-updates/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-19-footer.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook to Buy Giphy for $400M</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-to-buy-giphy-for-400-million-4a75a359-833b-484d-b15b-87e94d3de017.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-to-buy-giphy-for-400-million-4a75a359-833b-484d-b15b-87e94d3de017.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook has agreed to buy Giphy, the popular platform of sharable animated images, Axios has learned from multiple sources. The total deal value is around $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; A source close to the situation says that the two companies first began talking prior to the pandemic, although that was more about a partnership than an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Giphy is expected to retain its own branding, with its primary integration to come via Facebook's Instagram platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York-based Giphy had raised around $150 million in VC funding since its 2013 inception, from firms like Betaworks (which incubated the company), Lerer Hippeau, IVP, DFJ Growth, GGV Capital, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Its most recent private valuation was around $600 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook is facing enormous blowback over its previous acquisitions, which means that this deal, however small by comparison, is likely to face a lot of antitrust scrutiny by regulators. The tech giant is currently under investigation by federal and state lawmakers for antitrust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Giphy is a massive video library, with hundreds of millions of daily users that share billions of GIFs, that generates revenue via branded content. Adding Facebook's ad sales and marketing firepower could be what transforms it from a popular service into a highly profitable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook just made it official &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;on its company blog&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-giphy/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;4a75a359-833b-484d-b15b-87e94d3de017&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Scoop: Facebook to buy Giphy for $400 million&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-giphy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on its company blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Giphy&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Whistleblower: Wall Street Has Engaged in Widespread Tampering of Mortgage Funds</title>
<link>https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
A whistleblower complaint accuses 14 major lenders, including Wells Fargo, one of the country’s biggest CMBS issuers, of widespread manipulation of mortgage funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;422.92868240365&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;top-notes&quot; readability=&quot;5.6178571428571&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; id=&quot;newsletter-txt-note&quot; readability=&quot;6.9142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.propublica.org/big-story-2019&quot;&gt;our biggest stories&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they’re published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;Among the toxic contributors to the financial crisis of 2008, few caused as much havoc as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/series/the-wall-street-money-machine&quot;&gt;mortgages with dodgy numbers and inflated values&lt;/a&gt;. Huge quantities of them were assembled into securities that crashed and burned, damaging homeowners and investors alike. Afterward, reforms were promised. Never again, regulators vowed, would real estate financiers be able to fudge numbers and threaten the entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;Twelve years later, there’s evidence something similar is happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;Some of the world’s biggest banks — including Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank — as well as other lenders have engaged in a systematic fraud that allowed them to award borrowers bigger loans than were supported by their true financials, according to a previously unreported whistleblower complaint submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.3&quot;&gt;Whereas the fraud during the last crisis was in residential mortgages, the complaint claims this time it’s happening in commercial properties like office buildings, apartment complexes and retail centers. The complaint focuses on the loans that are gathered into pools whose worth can exceed $1 billion and turned into bonds sold to investors, known as CMBS (for commercial mortgage-backed securities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;Lenders and securities issuers have regularly altered financial data for commercial properties “without justification,” the complaint asserts, in ways that make the properties appear more valuable, and borrowers more creditworthy, than they actually are. As a result, it alleges, borrowers have qualified for commercial loans they normally would not have, with the investors who bought securities birthed from those loans none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;ProPublica closely examined six loans that were part of CMBS in recent years to see if their data resembles the pattern described by the whistleblower. What we found matched the allegations: The historical profits reported for some buildings were listed as much as 30% higher than the profits previously reported for the same buildings and same years when the property was part of an earlier CMBS. As a rough analogy, imagine a homeowner having stated in a mortgage application that his 2017 income was $100,000 only to claim during a later refinancing that his 2017 income was $130,000 — without acknowledging or explaining the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;It’s “highly questionable” to alter past profits with no apparent explanation, said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in securities regulation. “I don’t understand why you can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;In theory, CMBS are supposed to undergo a rigorous multistage vetting process. A property owner seeking a loan on, say, an office building would have its finances scrutinized by a bank or other lender. After that loan is made, it would be subjected to another round of due diligence, this time by an investment bank that assembles 60 to 120 loans to form a CMBS. Somewhere along the line, according to John Flynn, a veteran of the CMBS industry who filed the whistleblower complaint, numbers are being adjusted — inevitably to make properties, and therefore the entire CMBS, look more financially robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;The complaint suggests widespread efforts to make adjustments. Some expenses were erased from the ledger, for example, when a new loan was issued. Most changes were small; but a minor increase in profits can lead to approval for a significantly higher mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;The result: Many properties may have borrowed more than they could afford to pay back — even before the pandemic rocked their businesses — making a CMBS crash both more likely and more damaging. “It’s a higher cliff from which they are falling,” Flynn said. “So the loss severity is going to be greater and the probability of default is going to be greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.6&quot;&gt;With the economy being pounded and trillions of dollars already committed to bailouts, potential overvaluations in commercial real estate loom much larger than they would have even a few months ago. Data from early April showed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/april-cmbs-remittance-data-reveals-more-than-10x-increase-in-non-payment-of-hotel-loans-5x-for-retail?utm_source=hs_email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=86354911&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--noLsqRN8l1KIhKUAe8BMQ9wyQC5yZ0nB-VDW99ULiqWxe7yNJlJ-nbP4SMsyVahpV5bvLzE5mA4tqY9Xa1IWuT07KbhJKHZPmbxeIK7Ax5M5hLmY&amp;amp;_hsmi=86354911&quot;&gt;sharp spike&lt;/a&gt; in missed payments to bondholders for CMBS that hold loans from hotels and retail stores, according to Trepp, a data provider whose specialties include CMBS. The default rate is expected to climb as large swaths of the nation remain locked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;After lobbying by commercial real estate organizations and advocacy by real estate investor and Trump ally Tom Barrack — &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tombarrackjr/preventing-covid-19-from-infecting-the-commercial-mortgage-market-e7444701745e&quot;&gt;who warned of a looming commercial mortgage crash&lt;/a&gt; — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a1.pdf&quot;&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; in early April to prop up CMBS by loaning money to investors and letting them use their CMBS as collateral. The goal is to stabilize the market at a time when investors may be tempted to dump their securities, and also to support banks in issuing new bonds. (Barrack’s company, Colony Capital, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/18e56027-60fe-442f-a998-f6b8af845075&quot;&gt;has since defaulted on $3.2 billion in debt backed by hotel and health care properties&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Financial Times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;The Fed didn’t specify how much it’s willing to spend to support the CMBS, and it is allowing only those with the highest credit ratings to be used as collateral. But if some ratings are based on misleading data, as the complaint alleges, taxpayers could be on the hook for a riskier-than-anticipated portfolio of loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;The SEC, which has not taken public action on the whistleblower complaint, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;Some lenders interviewed for this article maintain they’re permitted to alter properties’ historical profits under some circumstances. Others in the industry offered a different view. Adam DeSanctis, a spokesperson for the Mortgage Bankers Association, which has helped set guidelines for financial reporting in CMBS, said he reached out to members of the group’s commercial real estate team and none had heard of a practice of inflating profits. “We aren’t aware of this occurring and really don’t have anything to add,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;The notion that profit figures for some buildings are pumped up is surprising, said Kevin Riordan, a finance professor at Montclair State University. It raises questions about whether the proper disclosures are being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;Investors don’t comb through financial statements, added Riordan, who used to manage the CMBS portfolio for retirement fund giant TIAA-CREF. Instead, he said, they rely on summaries from investment banks and the credit ratings agencies that analyze the securities. To make wise decisions, investors’ information “out of the gate has to be pretty close to being right,” he said. “Otherwise you’re dealing with garbage. Garbage in, garbage out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.6&quot;&gt;The whistleblower complaint has its origins in the kinds of obsessions that keep wonkish investors up at night. Flynn wondered what was going to happen when some of the most ill-conceived commercial loans — those made in the lax, freewheeling days before the financial crisis of 2008 — matured a decade later. He imagined an impending disaster of mass defaults. But as 2015, then 2017, passed, the defaults didn’t come. It didn’t make sense to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.7&quot;&gt;Flynn, 55, has deep experience in commercial real estate, banking and CMBS. After growing up on a dairy farm in Minnesota, the youngest of 14 children, and graduating from college — the first in his family to do so, he said — Flynn moved to Tokyo to work, first in real estate, then in finance. Jobs with banks and ratings agencies took him to Belgium, Chicago and Australia. These days, he advises owners whose loans are sold into CMBS and helps them resolve disputes and restructure or modify problem loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.0&quot;&gt;He began poring over the fine print in CMBS filings and noticed curious anomalies. For example, many properties changed their names, and even their addresses, from one CMBS to another. That made it harder to recognize a specific property and compare its financial details in two filings. As Flynn read more and more, he began to wonder whether the alterations were attempts to obscure discrepancies: These same properties were typically reporting higher net operating incomes in the new CMBS than they did for the same year in a previous CMBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.1&quot;&gt;Flynn ultimately collected and analyzed data for huge numbers of commercial mortgages. He began to see patterns and what he calls a massive problem: Flynn has amassed “materials identifying about $150 billion in inflated CMBS issued between 2013 and today,” according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.2&quot;&gt;The higher reported profits helped the properties qualify for loans they might not have otherwise obtained, he surmised. They also paved the way for bigger fees for banks. “Inflating historical cash flows creates a misperception of lower current and historical cash flow volatility, enables higher underwritten [net operating income/net cash flow], and higher collateral values,” the complaint states, “and thereby enables higher debt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.3&quot;&gt;Flynn eventually found a lawyer and, in February 2019, he filed the whistleblower complaint. The complaint accuses 14 major lenders — including three of the country’s biggest CMBS issuers, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Ladder Capital — and seven servicers of inflating historical cash flows, failing to report misrepresentations, changing names and addresses of properties and “deceptively and inaccurately” describing mortgage-loan representations. It doesn’t identify which companies allegedly manipulated each specific number. (Spokespeople for Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo declined to comment on the record. The complaint does not mention Barrack or his company. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.4&quot;&gt;The SEC has the power to fine companies and their executives if fraud is established. If the SEC recovers more than $1 million based on Flynn’s claim, he could be entitled to a portion of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;When Flynn filed the complaint, the skies looked clear for the commercial mortgage market. Indeed, last year was a boom year for CMBS, with private lenders in the U.S. issuing roughly $96.7 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities — a 27% increase over 2018, which made it the most successful year since the last financial crisis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbs-issuance-hits-96-7-billion-in-2019-who-are-the-most-active-bookrunners&quot;&gt;according to Trepp&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, investors hold CMBS worth $592 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.6&quot;&gt;Flynn’s assertions raise questions about the efficacy of post-crisis reforms that Congress and the SEC instituted that sought to place new restrictions on banks and other lenders, increase transparency and protect consumers and investors. The regulations that were retooled included the one that governs CMBS, known as Regulation AB. The goal was to make disclosures clearer and more complete for investors, so they would be less reliant on ratings agencies, which were widely criticized during the financial crisis for lax practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.0&quot;&gt;Still, the opinion of the credit-ratings agencies remains crucial today, a point reinforced by the Fed’s decision to hinge its bailout decisions on those ratings. That’s a problem, in the view of Neil Barofsky, who served as the U.S. Treasury’s inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief Program from 2008 to 2011. “Practically nothing” was done to reform the ratings agencies, Barofsky said, which could lead to the sorts of problems that emerged in the bailout a decade ago. If things truly turn bad for the commercial real estate industry or if fraud is discovered, he added, the Fed could end up taking possession of properties that default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.1&quot;&gt;CMBS can be something of a last resort for borrowers whose projects are unlikely to qualify for a loan with a desirable interest rate from a bank or other lender (because they are too big, too risky or some other reason), according to experts. Underwriting practices — the due diligence lenders do before extending a loan — for CMBS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reonomy.com/blog/post/cmbs-loans-explained&quot;&gt;have gained a reputation&lt;/a&gt; for being less strict than for loans that banks keep on their balance sheets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-111JPRT54785/html/CPRT-111JPRT54785.htm&quot;&gt;Government watchdogs&lt;/a&gt; found serious deficiencies in the underwriting for securitized commercial mortgages during the financial crisis, just as they did in the subprime residential market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.2&quot;&gt;The due diligence process broke down, Flynn maintains, in precisely the mortgages he was worried about: the 10-year loans obtained before the financial crisis. What Flynn discovered, he said, was that rather than lowering the values for properties that had taken on bigger loans than they could pay off, their owners instead obtained new loans. “Someone should have taken the losses,” he said. “Instead, they papered over it, inflated the cash flow and sold it on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.3&quot;&gt;For commercial borrowers, small bumps in a property’s profits can qualify the borrower for millions more in loans. Shaving expenses by about a third to boost profit, for instance, can sometimes allow a borrower to increase a loan’s size by a third as well — even if the expenses run only in the thousands, and the loan runs in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.4&quot;&gt;Some executives for lenders acknowledged to ProPublica that they made changes to borrowers’ past financials — scrubbing expenses from prior years they deemed irrelevant for the new loan — but maintained that it is appropriate to do so. Accounting firms review financial data before the loans are assembled into CMBS, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;The financial data that ProPublica examined — a sample of six loans among the thousands Flynn identified as having inflated net operating income — revealed potential weaknesses not readily apparent to the average investor. For those six loans, the profits for a given year were listed as 9% to 30% higher in new securities than in the old. After they were issued, half of those loans ended up on watch lists for problem debt, meaning the properties were considered at heightened risk for default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.6&quot;&gt;In each of the six loans, the profit inflation seemed to be explained by decreases in the costs reported. Expenses reported for a particular year in one CMBS simply vanished in disclosures for the same year in a new CMBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.0&quot;&gt;Such a pattern appeared in a $36.7 million loan by Ladder Capital in 2015 to a team that purchased the Doubletree San Diego, a half-century-old hotel that struggled for years to bring in enough income to satisfy loan servicers, even under a previous, smaller loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.1&quot;&gt;The hotel’s new loan saddled it with far greater debt, increasing its main loan by 60% — even though the property had landed on a watchlist in 2010 because of declining revenue. Analysts at Moody’s pegged the hotel’s new loan as exceeding the value of the property by 40.5% (meaning a loan-to-value ratio of 140.5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.2&quot;&gt;Filings for the new loan claimed much higher profits than what the old loan had cited for the same years: The hotel’s net operating income for two years magically jumped from what had previously been reported: 21% and 16% larger for 2013 and 2014, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.3&quot;&gt;Such figures are supposed to be pulled from a property’s “most recent operating statement,” according to the regulation governing CMBS disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.4&quot;&gt;But, in response to questions from ProPublica, lender Ladder Capital said it altered the expense numbers it provided in the Doubletree’s historical financials. Ladder said it wiped lease payments —$700,608 and $592,823 in those two years — from the historical financials, because the new owner would not make lease payments in the future. (The previous owner had leased the building from an affiliated company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;Ladder, a publicly traded commercial real estate investment trust that reports more than $6 billion in assets, said in a statement, “These differences are due to items that were considered by Ladder Capital during the due diligence process and reported appropriately in all relevant disclosures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.6&quot;&gt;Yet when ProPublica asked Ladder to share its disclosures about the changes, the firm pointed to a section of the pool’s prospectus that didn’t mention lease payments, or explain or acknowledge the change in income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.7&quot;&gt;The Doubletree did not fare well under its new debt package. Revenues and occupancy declined after 2015 and by 2017, the hotel’s loan was back on the watch list. The hotel missed franchise fee payments. Ladder foreclosed in December 2019, after problems with an additional $5.8 million loan the lender had extended the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.8&quot;&gt;The Doubletree loan was not the only loan in its CMBS pool, issued by Deutsche Bank in 2015, with apparently inflated profits. Flynn said he was able to track down previous loan information for loans representing nearly 40% of the pool, and all had inflated income figures at some point in their historical financial data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;11.9&quot;&gt;There was also a noticeable profit increase in two loans Ladder issued for a strip mall in suburban Pennsylvania. The mall’s past results improved when they appeared in a new CMBS. Its 2016 net operating income, previously listed as $1,101,207 in one CMBS, now appeared as $1,352,353 in another, data from Trepp shows — an increase of 23%. The prospectus for the latter does not explain or acknowledge the change in income. The mall owner received a $14 million loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.0&quot;&gt;Less than a year after it was placed into a CMBS, the loan ran into trouble. It landed on a watchlist after one of its major tenants, a department store, declared bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.1&quot;&gt;Ladder said it excluded $203,787 in expenses from the new loan because they stemmed from one-time costs for environmental remediation of pollution by a dry cleaner and a roof repair. Ladder did not explain why the previous lender did not exclude the expense also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.2&quot;&gt;The pattern can be seen in loans made by other lenders, too. In a CMBS issued by Wells Fargo, a 1950s-era trailer park at the base of a steep bluff along the coast in Los Angeles reported sharply higher profits — for the same years — than it previously had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.3&quot;&gt;The Pacific Palisades Bowl Park received a $12.9 million loan from the bank in 2016. The park reported expenses that were about a third lower in its new loan disclosures when compared with earlier ones. As a result, the $1.2 million in net operating income for 2014 rose 28% above what had been reported for the same year under the old loan. A similar jump occurred in 2013. (Edward Biggs, the owner of the park, said he gave Wells Fargo the park’s financials when refinancing its loan and wasn’t aware of discrepancies in what was reported to investors. “I don’t know anything about that,” he said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.4&quot;&gt;Flynn said he found that for the $575 million Wells Fargo CMBS that contained the Palisades debt, about half of the loan pool appeared to have reported inflated profits at some point, when comparing the same years in different securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;Another of the loans ProPublica examined with apparently inflated profits was for a building in downtown Philadelphia. When the owner refinanced through Wells Fargo, the property’s 2015 profit appeared 23% higher than it had in reports under the old loan. Wells bundled the debt into a mortgage-backed security in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;13.6&quot;&gt;The building, One Penn Center, is a historic Art Deco office high-rise with ornate black marble and gold-plated fixtures, and a transit station underneath. One of the primary tenants, leasing 45,000 square feet for one of its regional headquarters, happens to be the SEC. The agency declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrape public filings of the buy + sell orders of U.S. senators and calculate their returns. This repo contains a script to scrape the electronic filings at &lt;a href=&quot;https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/&lt;/a&gt; and a Jupyter notebook to analyze the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;python3, Selenium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrape all of the senators' filings: &lt;code&gt;python3 main.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze the results by starting a Jupyter server and going through the notebook: &lt;code&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We only look at electronic publicly filed trades by senators. Some periodic transaction reports are PDFs, which are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We calculate returns only using the trades observed. This is almost definitely not representative of a senator's entire portfolio. A more accurate way of thinking about the returns is a portfolio that mimics the observed buys and sells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the periodic transaction report specifies a range ($1000 - $5000), then we assume the amount is the lower bound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ignore trades for tickers that do not have data through the Yahoo Finance API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The portfolio is not allowed to go short.&lt;/li&gt;
