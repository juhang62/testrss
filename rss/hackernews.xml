&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;N E W   L O N D O N,  Conn., Sept. 8, 2000 -- A man whose bid to become a police officer was rejected after he scored too high on an intelligence test has lost an appeal in his federal lawsuit against the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court’s decision that the city did not discriminate against Robert Jordan because the same standards were applied to everyone who took the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This kind of puts an official face on discrimination in America against people of a certain class,” Jordan said today from his Waterford home. “I maintain you have no more control over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your gender or anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he does not plan to take any further legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate, took the exam in 1996 and scored 33 points, the equivalent of an IQ of 125. But New London police interviewed only candidates who scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those who scored too high could get bored with police work and leave soon after undergoing costly training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Cops Just Above Normal The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22, the equivalent of an IQ of 104, or just a little above average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan alleged his rejection from the police force was discrimination. He sued the city, saying his civil rights were violated because he was denied equal protection under the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. District Court found that New London had “shown a rational basis for the policy.” In a ruling dated Aug. 23, the 2nd Circuit agreed. The court said the policy might be unwise but was a rational way to reduce job turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan has worked as a prison guard since he took the test.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Basic Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (2019)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qvault.io/2019/12/31/very-basic-intro-to-elliptic-curve-cryptography/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Updated – May 31, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a basic introduction to elliptic curve cryptography. I will assume most of my audience is here to gain an understanding of why ECC is an effective cryptographic tool and the basics of why it works. My goal is to explain it in a general sense, I will be omitting proofs and implementation details and instead focusing on the high-level principles of what makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;What_Its_For&quot;&gt;What It’s For?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only specific people can decrypt it. This has several obvious real-life use cases, but the main usage is in encrypting internet data and traffic. For instance, you can use ECC to ensure that when you send an email, no one but the recipient can read the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ECC_is_a_type_of_Public_Key_Cryptography&quot;&gt;ECC is a type of Public Key Cryptography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Helman, etc. I’m going to give a very simple background of public-key cryptography in general as a starting point so we can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. Please, by all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen below, public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic shows two keys, a public key, and a private key. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data so that anyone in the world can look at the encrypted data while it is being transmitted, and be unable to read the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;An_Example_of_Public-Key-Cryptography&quot;&gt;An Example of Public-Key-Cryptography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the President sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using Public Key Cryptography would go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key= “I love Fox and Friends”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see this is a very useful technology. Here are some key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The public key can be sent to anyone. It is public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key they could decrypt the messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers can very quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and the private key to decrypt a message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers require a very long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;How_it_Works_The_Trapdoor_Function&quot;&gt;How it Works: The Trapdoor Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way easily (in less than millions of years using modern computers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a trapdoor function: &lt;em&gt;A + B = C&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m given A and B I can compute C. The problem is that if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trapdoor function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If given &lt;em&gt;“I love Fox and Friends”&lt;/em&gt; and the public key, I can produce &lt;em&gt;“s80s1s9sadjds9s”&lt;/em&gt;, but if given &lt;em&gt;“s80s1s9sadjds9s”&lt;/em&gt; and the Public Key I can’t produce &lt;em&gt;“I love Fox and Friends”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RSA (Probably the most popular public-key system) the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Key: &lt;em&gt;944,871,836,856,449,473&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Key: &lt;em&gt;961,748,941&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;982,451,653&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;What_Makes_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Different&quot;&gt;What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use ECC for the exact same reasons as RSA. It simply generates a public and private key and allows two parties to communicate securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-ctt-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fpb7Qei-9x&amp;amp;text=There%20is%20one%20major%20advantage%20however%20that%20ECC%20offers%20over%20RSA.%20A%20256%20bit%20key%20in%20ECC%20offers%20about%20the%20same%20security%20as%20a%203072-bit%20key%20using%20RSA.%20This%20benefits%20systems%20with%20limited%20resources.%20&amp;amp;via=wagslane&amp;amp;related=wagslane&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;There is one major advantage however that ECC offers over RSA. A 256 bit key in ECC offers about the same security as a 3072-bit key using RSA. This benefits systems with limited resources.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fpb7Qei-9x&amp;amp;text=There%20is%20one%20major%20advantage%20however%20that%20ECC%20offers%20over%20RSA.%20A%20256%20bit%20key%20in%20ECC%20offers%20about%20the%20same%20security%20as%20a%203072-bit%20key%20using%20RSA.%20This%20benefits%20systems%20with%20limited%20resources.%20&amp;amp;via=wagslane&amp;amp;related=wagslane&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bctt-ctt-btn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones, embedded computers, and cryptocurrency networks are able to use 10% of the hard disk space and bandwidth required by RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ECCs_Trapdoor_Function&quot;&gt;ECC’s Trapdoor Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably why most of you are here. This is what makes ECC special and different from RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool. First, we start with a certain point on the curve. Next, we use a function (called the dot function) to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Lets walk through the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting at A:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dot B = -C (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect across the X axis from -C to C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dot C = -D (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect across the X axis from -D to D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dot D = -E (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflect across the X axis from -E to E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it is very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Key: Number of hops from A to E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Questions&quot;&gt;Questions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;How_is_the_second_point_found_If_the_dot_function_is_basically_drawing_a_line_between_two_points_dont_you_need_a_second_point_to_start_with&quot;&gt;How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start with?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P dot P= -R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is P dot P? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;What_happens_if_the_dot_function_produces_a_line_that_will_go_way_off_out_to_some_extreme&quot;&gt;What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some extreme?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;I_get_the_trapdoor_function_but_how_are_public_and_private_keys_created_in_practice_How_are_they_used_in_conjunction_with_data_to_be_encrypted&quot;&gt;I get the trapdoor function, but how are public and private keys created in practice? How are they used in conjunction with data to be encrypted?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question, but it requires a much more in-depth answer. I gave very hand-wavy explanations of both RSA and ECC in this article. However, there are plenty of more technical resources out there and I encourage you to look into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Who_Cares&quot;&gt;Who Cares?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first studied ECC because of my interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm cryptocurrencies today because it uses less than 10% of the key size (and by extension data) of RSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you learned a bit about ECC and public-key cryptography, this is by no means a technical description. I hope to give more people an interest in the capabilities of ECC and general knowledge of why it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Scrubber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;


This is a tool for anonymizing photographs taken at protests. 

It will remove identifying metadata (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif&quot;&gt;Exif data&lt;/a&gt;) from photographs, and also allow you to selectively blur parts of the image to cover faces and other identifiable information. 

Hit the open button to open a photograph. The program will display the data it is removing.

Click okay, and you can then save the scrubbed image by hitting save or right clicking on it and saving it. Maximum size is 2500x2500 pixels - larger images will be scaled down.

You can select between painting over the image or blurring it out. Dragging on the image will paint on or blur it. You can change your brush size via the slider. The blur function has built-in pixelization and noise.

&lt;strong&gt;All processing happens directly in the browser- no information is stored or sent anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;61.03952901598&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station May 31, less than a day after making history as the first human orbital spaceflight from the United States in nearly nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft, named Endeavour by its crew of NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, docked with the station’s Harmony module at 10.16 a.m. Eastern. The spacecraft’s approach to the ISS went smoothly, with docking taking place nearly 15 minutes ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a real honor to be be just a small part of this nine-year endeavor since the last time a United States spaceship has docked with the International Space Station,” said Hurley moments after docking, thanking NASA and SpaceX for their efforts developing the Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of NASA’s commercial crew program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behnken and Hurley opened hatches and entered the ISS at 1:22 p.m. Eastern, joining NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacenews.com/crew-dragon-in-orbit-after-historic-launch/&quot;&gt;launched on a Falcon 9 at 3:22 p.m. Eastern May 30&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first crewed orbital launch from the United States since the final space shuttle mission, STS-135, in July 2011. Behnken and Hurley said in a brief NASA TV session early May 31 that the spacecraft was working well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That included using the manual controls of the spacecraft, which ordinarily operates autonomously. “I want to complement the teams at Hawthorne. Just a spectacular job with the simulator as the vehicle flew exactly like the simulators out in Hawthorne,” Hurley said, referring to SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behnken, though, noted that those simulators weren’t able to fully capture the experience of launch. “Doug and I were talking about all of the observations that we had all the way uphill,” he said. “While it was an exciting ride, I think we got a couple of minor surprises, just in terms of the way the vehicle is moving and shaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While docking took place only 19 hours after liftoff, the two astronauts said they were able to test various aspects of the spacecraft, including the ability to sleep inside the capsule. “Doug and I had a good night’s sleep last night,” Behnken said. “We were surprised, I think, at how well we actually slept aboard the vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A 1/48 scale model of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket</title>
<link>https://bps.space/falcon-heavy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bps.space/falcon-heavy</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Flight 2 of the Falcon Heavy model will take place in early 2019. Primary goals will be resolving the mechanical issues with the center core, reducing overall mass, and streamlining vehicle flight prep procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, do I even have to say it? Of course those boosters are gonna land! The propulsive landing test program is isolated from the Falcon Heavy program right now, but the two will merge as the success rate for both programs increases.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Xfce switches to GitLab</title>
<link>https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2020/04/30/xfce-switches-to-gitlab/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://simon.shimmerproject.org/2020/04/30/xfce-switches-to-gitlab/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;GitLab is here!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, May 1, we’re switching from our cgit/gitolite setup to GitLab. Our old server, git.xfce.org, is now a ready-only in-sync mirror (so you can still pull code). Our new server is gitlab.xfce.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The detailed version of this blog post can be read in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.xfce.org/pipermail/xfce4-dev/2020-April/032436.html&quot;&gt;announcement on the Xfce Mailing List&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/preview/gitlab-logo-white-preview.png&quot; width=&quot;3828&quot; height=&quot;1688&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt; nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;distributors&lt;/strong&gt; nothing changes (presuming you’re using the release tarballs and not Git tags).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;developers and contributors&lt;/strong&gt; quite a few things change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most importantly: The Git URL changed, so you need to update the remotes of your local repositories. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ochosi/xfce-helpers/blob/master/xfce-migrate-to-gl&quot;&gt;Feel free to use our helper script.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork repositories and use branches and merge requests!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t have an account yet (we created quite a few for you regulars already) please sign up! We have opened registrations for GitLab accounts as well as allowing you to register with your GitHub account (if you have one).&lt;br/&gt;Please poke us on IRC or the mailinglist if you’re lacking repository access or ownership. (By default new users cannot fork before being manually approved. Yes. We &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; afraid of the spambots.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.xfce.org&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UK government MPs are using Signal’s automatic deletion feature</title>
<link>https://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1522/news</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.private-eye.co.uk/issue-1522/news</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.private-eye.co.uk/grfx/logos/news-red.gif&quot; alt=&quot;news&quot; width=&quot;190&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;headline&quot;&gt;Trash talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Government secrecy ,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.private-eye.co.uk/current-issue&quot; class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Issue 1522&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.private-eye.co.uk/pictures/news/boris-phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boris-phone.jpg&quot; class=&quot;article&quot;/&gt;ENCRYPTED messaging app Signal is increasingly popular in Westminster. Many Tory MPs joined the network after the general election, apparently attracted by the larger group size it allows compared to WhatsApp, which is handy for a party with a big majority.
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of the app, which is endorsed by none other than Edward Snowden, has attracted Boris Johnson as well as senior government officials: messages can be set to automatically self-destruct from recipients’ devices any time from five seconds to a week after being read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encrypted nature of the system means that once messages are gone they’re, er, gone, and not even a judge’s order can have them retrieved. And the benefits aren’t limited to making leaks more difficult. The automatic deletion suggests a perilous lack of records on key decision-making processes at a time when many in government are working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No record exists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the short term, freedom of information requests for data can be met with the response that no such records are held as they’ve already been deleted. Manual deletion after a request has been made is an offence under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but if the records have already been deleted, or indeed are automatically deleted after the request is made, no crime is committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, public inquiries into important matters of national interest – and not just how pandemic policy decisions were made on the hoof by the current administration – may be stymied by the fact that no record exists. For example, future historians heading to the National Archives to see how the 2020 pandemic was handled, expecting a wealth of civil servant-penned minutes, may be presented with an empty box marked “Signal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal isn’t the first digital platform to be used by the government with an automatic deletion policy. Starting in late 2004, before the FOIA came into force in early 2005, Downing Street implemented an automatic 90-day deletion of emails aside from those specifically selected by civil servants as relevant for storage in the National Archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caught out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaving it to ministers and spads to choose deletion periods may be problematic. Under the code of practice for the FOIA, public authorities should ensure that records “remain usable for as long as they are required” and consider “the need to refer to authoritative information about past actions and decisions for current business purposes. For example, problems such as outbreaks of foot and mouth disease… The need to explain, and if necessary justify, past actions in the event of an audit, public inquiry or other investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the Johnson government has already been caught out by well-kept physical records, let alone electronic ones, after the publication of No 10 memos in which Boris referred to Cameron as “a girly swot” and revealed prorogation had been planned weeks in advance, Whitehall’s definition of “as long as they are required” may differ from those hoping to scrutinise government policy-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding political leaks, Signal’s own guidance states: “Disappearing messages are [...] a collaborative feature for conversations where all participants want to automate minimalist data hygiene, not for situations where your contact is your adversary.” So that’s all right, then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;block-sections&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PANDEMIC UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Risk in the time of Corona – a full round-up from the Eye’s medical correspondent, MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RISHI LIST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sunday Times Rich List highlights special tax treatment for the wealthiest, but will Rishi Sunak really ensure that ‘we must all pay in equally in future’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARDING IMMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the appointment of political insider Baroness (Dido) Harding as chair the government’s Covid test and trace programme is less than reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIGHT GROUNDED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the aviation industry in meltdown, the prospects for Heathrow bosses’ ongoing legal fight in favour of a third runway don’t look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVERING TRACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department for Transport’s cover-up of HS2’s crazy cost spiral is just the latest episode in a project built on falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLIGHT OF FANCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The repatriation of Brits stranded abroad has been an utter shambles – yet Whitehall still gives Dominic Raab’s Foreign Office a gold star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIKTOK SCHLOCK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with all those complicated dance routines, the world’s most popular app with the under-20s has become a vector for Covid-related conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARE-LESS…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having funnelled squillions offshore, HC-One, Britain’s largest care home group, now goes cap-in-hand to its local authority paymasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CASH TEST DUMMIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given its failings on data and habit of sucking up to foreign regimes, Deloitte’s central role in the Covid testing programme should sound alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRIENDS REUNITED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than ramp up the NHS’s own capacity, Matt Hancock rewards old chums of the Tory party with contracts to run drive-through CV-19 testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUNK WITHOUT TRACERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The government’s 15,000 unqualified Covid contact tracers, supplied by call centres, will be medically “supervised” by, er, script. So that’s all right, then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO BREATHING ROOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muscular dystrophy patients say they are being denied filters for the home ventilators that keep them alive because they are needed for Covid-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMPUTER SAYS NO…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small businesses applying for government-backed Bounce Back loans via HSBC have been stymied by an idiotic glitch in the bank’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSTRUCTION NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many building workers were busy during lockdown, leading to arguments over infection control and daft “15-minute” close contact guidance, now rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>What computer and software is used by the Falcon 9? (2015)</title>
<link>https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/what-computer-and-software-is-used-by-the-falcon-9/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/what-computer-and-software-is-used-by-the-falcon-9/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SpaceX uses an Actor-Judge system to provide triple redundancy to its rockets and spacecraft. The Falcon 9 has 3 dual core x86 processors running an instance of linux on each core. The flight software is written in C/C++ and runs in the x86 environment. For each calculation/decision, the &quot;flight string&quot; compares the results from both cores. If there is a inconsistency, the string is bad and doesn't send any commands. If both cores return the same response, the string sends the command to the various microcontrollers on the rocket that control things like the engines and grid fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microcontrollers, running on PowerPC processors, received three commands from the three flight strings. They act as a judge to choose the correct course of actions. If all three strings are in agreement the microcontroller executes the command, but if 1 of the 3 is bad, it will go with the strings that have previously been correct. The Falcon 9 can successfully complete its mission with a single flight string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triple redundancy gives the system radiation tolerance without the need for expensive rad hardened components. SpaceX tests all flight software on what can be called a table rocket. They lay out all the computers and flight controllers on the Falcon 9 on a table and connect them like they would be on the actual rocket. They then run a complete simulated flight on the components, monitoring performance and potential failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX engineers perform what they call &quot;Cutting the strings&quot; where they randomly shut off a flight computer mid simulation, to see how it responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon uses a similar triple redundant system for its flight computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Bonus: Dragon V2 control panels are modified 17&quot; Tesla Model S touchscreens and include the same Nvidia Tegra SoCs. They are not part of the flight hardware and are only used to display the GUI.&lt;/strike&gt; After talking with the Dragon team at GDC2016, it appears Tesla hardware is not used. They do use some interesting software on Dragon 2. They use Chromium and JavaScript for the Dragon 2 flight interface. The actual flight computers still run on C++.&lt;/p&gt;
