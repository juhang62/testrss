<title>Calculus Explained with GIFs and Pics (2014)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://0a.io/chapter1/calculus-explained.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Calculus is just a fanciful name for the study of change in maths. Calculus in general refers to the branch of maths that was made famous by Newton in the 17th century. Don’t confuse it with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus&quot;&gt;Lambda calculus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus&quot;&gt;propositional calculus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385375557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385375557&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=0aarhe-20&amp;amp;linkId=G75NU4TLDFAYKFK2&quot;&gt;unicorns&lt;/a&gt;, which are completely different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand calculus, one needs to be able to visualize the concepts of &lt;u class=&quot;go_click&quot;&gt;function&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u class=&quot;go_click&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u class=&quot;go_click&quot;&gt;differentiation&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u class=&quot;go_click&quot;&gt;integration&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;● ● ●&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index to_function&quot;&gt;1. What is a function?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;u&gt;function&lt;/u&gt; can be seen as a machine that takes in value and gives you back another value. It is what we use in maths to map numbers (input) to other numbers (output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/f_machine.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ f(input) = output \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function is normally defined by an equation like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(x) = x+10\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you put 2 into this function you will get 12 in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(2) = 12\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.0513833992095&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of numbers that you can put into a function is known as the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; of the function. If you’d like to have a more in-depth understanding of function (e.g. its formal definition), check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://0a.io/0a-explains-set-theory-and-axiomatic-systems-with-pics-and-gifs&quot;&gt;my article on set theory&lt;/a&gt;. (You will probably love it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index to_limit&quot;&gt;2. What is a limit?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;u&gt;limit&lt;/u&gt; is the number you are “expected” to get from a function (or algebraic expression) when it takes in a certain input. By “expected” it is referring to the expectation of the output when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; “approaches” a certain value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example where the limit (the expected output) is the same as the actual output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 2}\frac{5^x}{25} = 1\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limit above is often read as “the limit of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{5^x}{25}\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches 2 is 1”. You can visualize “&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches 2” as a dot moving along the graph towards where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x = 2\)&lt;/span&gt; (and, as you can see, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/limit.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take this function for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(x) = \frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Division by 0 is undefined. We would get &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(undefined\)&lt;/span&gt; when we put 3 into the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(3) = \frac{(3^2-3 \cdot 3)^2}{3-3} = undefined \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also why there is a hole in the graph of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/hole.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking at the graph, we can see that 0 is the expected value when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; approaches 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 3}f(x) = 0 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compute the limit when the actual output is undefined, in normal case we simply need to simplify the algebraic expression to avoid division by 0. And then put the value &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is approaching into the function as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \frac{x^4-6x^3+9x^2}{x-3} = \frac{x^2(x-3)^2}{x-3} = x^2(x-3)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\lim_{x\rightarrow 3}\frac{(x^2-3x)^2}{x-3} = \lim_{x\rightarrow 3} x^2(x-3) = 3^2(3-3) = 0\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to learn more about limit, feel free to check out my essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://0a.io/chapter1/what-do-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-limit.html&quot;&gt;What do we talk about when we talk about limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index to_differentiation&quot;&gt;3. What is differentiation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiation is a fanciful name for the process of obtaining a &lt;u&gt;derivative&lt;/u&gt;. And a derivative is a function that gives you the “slope” (or rate of change) of another function at a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, differentiation can be seen as a machine that takes in a function and gives you back another function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/d_machine.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that the slope of a linear equation/function has a constant value. It has the same rate of change at every point on the line. So the graph of a linear equation/function is indeed a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/linear.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every value of 1 added to the input, a value of the slope (in this case, 4) would be added to the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/linear2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change between input and output is always in the ratio of 1 to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; is the value for the slope. Adding 0.1 to the input will trigger a change of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(+0.1m\)&lt;/span&gt; in the output, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}f(5)&amp;amp;=8 \\\\f(6) &amp;amp;= f(5) + 1 \times 4 = 12 \\\\f(5.1) &amp;amp;= f(5)+0.1\times 4 = 8.4 \\\\f(5.02) &amp;amp;= f(5)+0.02 \times 4 = 8.08 \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is only true for linear function. For functions that are not linear, every point doesn’t have a constant rate of change. Take a look at the function &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)=2^x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}f(3)&amp;amp;=8 \\\\f(4)&amp;amp;=16 \\\\f(5)&amp;amp;=32 \\\\ f(6)&amp;amp;=64 \\\\ f(7)&amp;amp;=128 \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/well.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when we cannot use a constant to represent the “slope”: we need to use a function that gives us different “slope” (rate of change) at different point. Or rather, we shouldn’t even call it a “slope” anymore since the rate of change is not constant. We call it derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you are still trying to get your head around what it means by “the rate of change is not constant”, imagine a cat at rest starts to accelerate constantly at &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(1m/s^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. Three seconds later it would be moving at the speed of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(3m/s\)&lt;/span&gt;. So far the rate of change in its speed is constant. But when the cat begins to slow down, the rate of change would no longer be constant.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index&quot;&gt;4. How to find the derivative of a function?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of change at a certain point in the function can be visualized as a straight line across the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;2.4166666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is normally called the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent&quot;&gt;tangent line at a certain point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a non-linear function doesn’t have a constant rate of change, it means that every point of the function needs a different straight line to represent the rate of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/nonlinear3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the derivative of a function is to find another function that will output a value at every point, which can be represented by a corresponding straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of change at point &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is therefore sometimes also known as the derivative at point &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the straight line that represents the derivative at a certain point, one way to do it is to first locate 2 different points on the graph and draw a line across them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/draw_a_straight_line.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.8541666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people refer to this line as a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line&quot;&gt;secant line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line represents a value. It represents the rate of change if the 2 points belong to a linear function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/belong.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now this function is not linear. So this line is not accurate at all if we try to use it to represent the rate of change at any one of the 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the closer the 2 points are, the more accurate the line is in representing the rate of change at any one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s start off with a line that cuts across 2 points (A and B), and shift the line accordingly as we shift B towards A along the graph. By the time B is at the same point as A, we would have a line that can accurately represent the rate of change at point A - we would have a line that represents the derivate of the function at point A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By turning the process above into a function (denoted by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;), this function would be the derivative of the function of the graph (denoted by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}slope &amp;amp;= \frac{y_B-y_A}{x_B-x_A}\\\\f'(x) &amp;amp;= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are denoting the coordinate of point B as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((x+h, f(x+h))\)&lt;/span&gt;. And what we are doing is obtaining a value for the straight line (the “slope”/derivative) at point A as we shift point B to A by making &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt; approach 0. So the coordinate becomes &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((x+0, f(x+0))\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is the coordinate for point A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/dot_closer2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the modern definition of derivative in terms of limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21.237150586114&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[aka Lagrange’s notation]&lt;/sub&gt;, here is another common notation for differentiation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz&quot;&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;, a great German mathematician, came up with this notation in the 17th century when he was still alive. He came up with it by seeing &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dx\)&lt;/span&gt; as an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal&quot;&gt;infinitesimal (infinitely small)&lt;/a&gt; change in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; [the input of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;]. And the single &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; at the numerator here is supposed to be merged with &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; to indicate an infinitesimal change in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; [the output of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;]. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is sometimes written as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; stands for the output of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a more &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_non-standard_analysis&quot;&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; way of defining a derivative: a derivative tells you the rate of change of the output at an infinitesimal scale as the input changes. Therefore it is &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dy\)&lt;/span&gt; [or &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(d\ f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;] divided by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dx\)&lt;/span&gt; - an infinitesimal change in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, divided by an infinitesimal change in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;. So we are defining derivative in terms of a fraction (&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)&lt;/span&gt;) here, instead of a limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this way of thinking about derivative &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis&quot;&gt;non-standard analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to get the derivative of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x^3\)&lt;/span&gt;. The straightforward way to do it is to compute the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^3 &amp;amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{(x+a)^3-x^3}{(x+a)-x} \\&amp;amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{a(3x^2+a(3x+a))}{a} \\&amp;amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0} 3\cdot x^2+a(3x+a) \\&amp;amp;=3\cdot x^2+0(3x+0) \\&amp;amp;=3 \cdot x^2\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can speed up the process by using shortcuts like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^n &amp;amp; = n(x^{n-1}) \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^3 &amp;amp;= 3(x^{3-1}) = 3 \cdot x^2 \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of famous shortcuts for differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shortcuts can all be derived from the limit of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}\)&lt;/span&gt; above. They are sometimes referred to as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules&quot;&gt;“differentiation rules”&lt;/a&gt;. Calling them “rules” certainly makes them sound like some fundamental principles in calculus, but the truth is they are merely shortcuts to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;to_antidifferentiation&quot;&gt;5. Introducing anti-differentiation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_index&quot;&gt;I shall now introduce a new concept called &lt;u&gt;anti-differentiation&lt;/u&gt;. It is just the inverse of differentiation. It can be seen as a machine that takes in a function, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and give you back another function, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, whose derivative is &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Here, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is known as the &lt;u&gt;anti-derivative&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/a_machine.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we will get the same derivative when differentiating functions that are only different at the part where it adds (or subtracts) a constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx} x^2+100 &amp;amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^2+49 &amp;amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} x^2 &amp;amp;= 2x \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, we can see that no matter what the constant is, it would always give us back the same function if we differentiate it. So, in order to be technically correct, we would need to put a placeholder, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(+ C\)&lt;/span&gt;, in the end of the function to indicate that the anti-derivative can be any function that plus some constant (or minus some constant for cases when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt; is negative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}f(x) &amp;amp;= 2x \\ \frac{d}{dx} g(x) &amp;amp;= f(x) \\ g(x) &amp;amp;= x^2 + C \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index to_integration&quot;&gt;6. What is integration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration is a fanciful name for the process of finding &lt;u&gt;integral&lt;/u&gt;. Integral here is referring to either &lt;u&gt;indefinite integral&lt;/u&gt;, or &lt;u&gt;definite integral&lt;/u&gt;. (Therefore sometimes we say indefinite integration or definite integration just to be specific.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indefinite integral&lt;/u&gt; is fundamentally equivalent to anti-derivative. They are basically the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/i_machine.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\frac{d}{dx}f(x) + C = g(x) \\\\ \int g(x)\ dx = f(x) + C \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;1.864406779661&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is shown in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus&quot;&gt;first fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dx\)&lt;/span&gt; in the equation indicates that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is the input we are integrating &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; with respect to. A function can take in more than one input [e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x,q) = x^2+q^3\)&lt;/span&gt;] so there are times when it is crucial to specify which input we are integrating the function with respect to [e.g. Is it &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt;? Integrating the function with respect to a different input would give us a different result].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Definite integral&lt;/u&gt; can be defined as the difference between 2 identical anti-derivatives that take in different inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\int_a^b g(x)\ dx = f(b)-f(a) \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often read as “the definite integral of g(x) from a to b”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.0208333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition of definite integral is derived from the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus&quot;&gt;second fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; here is sometimes referred to as the lower limit, while &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; is referred to as the upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another way to define what a definite integral is. Imagine you want to find out the area of the region under a curve in a graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/rs_fn.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/rs_area.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can approximate the area of the region by drawing rectangles under the curve and adding the area of these rectangles together. The smaller the width of the rectangle is, the more rectangle there would be, and the more accurate the approximation would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/rs1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/rs2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can actually be written into a summation. Here &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(\frac{b-a}{n})\cdot g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.3937007874016&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known as the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannSum.html&quot;&gt;Riemann sum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{b-a}{n}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the width of each rectangle, and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would be able to find the actual value for the area if we get the limit as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;, the number of rectangle, goes to &lt;u&gt;infinity&lt;/u&gt;. Infinity here can be imagined as a theoretically enormous number that is bigger than every real number on the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line&quot;&gt;number line&lt;/a&gt;. This limit is another way of defining &lt;u&gt;definite integral&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://0a.io/img/from-chapter-1/ri.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\int_a^b g(x)\ dx = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(\frac{b-a}{n})\cdot g(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integral defined in this way is often known as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral&quot;&gt;Riemann integral&lt;/a&gt;. When the limit exists, we say the function is Riemann-integrable. When a function is not Riemann-integrable, it doesn’t mean it is completely not integrable. It really just depends on how we define “integral”. In a branch of maths known as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis&quot;&gt;real analysis&lt;/a&gt;, integration is normally defined &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration&quot;&gt;in the Lebesgue’s way&lt;/a&gt;, different from the Riemann’s way above. Functions that can be integrated in the Lebesgue’s way are Lebesgue-integrable. One typical example for a function that is not Riemann-integrable but Lebesgue-integrable is the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_continuous_function&quot;&gt;nowhere continuous function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the limit above, we are getting the area of region underneath the graph of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(B\)&lt;/span&gt;. And this is actually equivalent to “stacking up” the rate of changes of its anti-derivative, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, at every point from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(B\)&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore we are actually getting the difference between &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(a)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(b)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is why definite integral of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is able to give us the area from point &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(B\)&lt;/span&gt; in the graph of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;: definite integral is giving us the overall change in value from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(a)\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(b)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely why &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dx\)&lt;/span&gt; is there as a part of the integral notation &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\int f(x)\ dx\)&lt;/span&gt;. In the logic that differentiation is defined as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can see that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\ dx = d f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; is an infinitesimal change interpreted as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{1}{\infty}\)&lt;/span&gt;. The relation of every &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; in the function &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; [how &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; changes affects &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; changes, vice versa] can therefore be constructed by indeterminately&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; summing up&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the infinite number of infinitesimal “slices” of its derivative &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, with each infinitesimal “slice” being a nonspecific&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; multiplied by an infinitesimal change in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(dx\)&lt;/span&gt;, that governs the value of the corresponding &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;indeterminately&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: this is why it is called &lt;em&gt;indefinite&lt;/em&gt; integration. We are getting a result in terms of a variable, rather than getting an actual value. summing up&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: this is what &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\int\)&lt;/span&gt; indicates in the notation. nonspecific&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: thus it is &lt;em&gt;indefinite&lt;/em&gt; integration. What matters is the relation in terms of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, not the actual value. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: this &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing the limit of a Riemann sum can really be a tedious thing to do. So what we normally do is to find the indefinite integral first before putting &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; into the indefinite integral and getting the difference between them (using the definition of definite integral from the 2nd fundamental theorem of calculus mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[g(x) = x^4 \\ \int g(x)\ dx =\frac{x^5}{5} + C \\ \int_2^3 g(x)\ dx = \frac{3^5}{5}-\frac{2^5}{5} = 42.2 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/q/710175/65082&quot;&gt;not always necessary to get the indefinite integral first (it is possible to arrive at an answer after some transformations of the definite integral)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index&quot;&gt;8. How to find the indefinite integral (anti-derivative) of a function?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we can reverse the differentiation shortcuts/rules above and turn them into integration shortcuts/rules. But sometimes a little bit of creativity is required for integration. Let’s take a look at the reverse-&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule&quot;&gt;chain-rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ f'(g(x))g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things don’t always come in a perfect bundle. To use reverse-chain-rule, most of the time we need to see the algebraic structure as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f'(g(x))\)&lt;/span&gt; and compute &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{g'(x)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x))\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example. Let’s say we need to solve this indefinite integral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{3}{x^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(2x+1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx = \int f'(g(x)) dx\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need to do now is to obtain &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; by integrating &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and obtain &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g'(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; by differentiating &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(x) = \int f'(x)\ dx = \int \frac{3}{x^2} \ dx= \frac{-3}{x}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} g(x) = \frac{d}{dx} 2x+1 = 2\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\int \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{g'(x)} \cdot f'(g(x)) \\&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{-3}{2x+1} + C \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we need to solve the definite integral &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\int_0^1 \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2} dx\)&lt;/span&gt;, we just put the two values into the indefinite integral and get the difference like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}\int_a^b \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot ( \frac{-3}{2 \cdot b +2} - \frac{-3}{2 \cdot a +2}) \\\\ \int_0^1 \frac{3}{(2x+1)^2}\ dx &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{-3}{2 \cdot 1 +2} - \frac{-3}{2 \cdot 0 +2}) \\&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1 \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique (reversing chain rule) is known as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution&quot;&gt;integration by substitution&lt;/a&gt;, or, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt;-substitution, where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(g(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is often written as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is: finding an indefinite integral can be really hard sometimes. Aside from the fact that there isn’t an “absolute” way of humanly doing it, there is actually a rigorous mathematical reason behind it. The set of functions we humans love to do differentiation on is normally closed under differentiation. This means if we differentiate a function, we should anticipate to get back a similar function (e.g. differentiating an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function&quot;&gt;elementary function&lt;/a&gt; gives us back an elementary function). But it is not the case for integration. It is possible to integrate an elementary function, and get a non-elementary function in return (e.g &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\int e^{x^2} dx\)&lt;/span&gt; ). And as we can see, definite integration is more of a local operation, while indefinite integration is a global operation. This is why sometimes it makes more sense to solve a definite integral using transformations and techniques, arriving at the answer without having to compute the indefinite integral. There are respected individuals (e.g. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/users/19661/vladimir-reshetnikov&quot;&gt;Vladimir Reshetnikov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/users/97378/cleo&quot;&gt;Cleo&lt;/a&gt; on Maths StackExchange) who are amazingly good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;● ● ●&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;_index&quot;&gt;9. Bonus: Partial derivative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a function has more than one input value, we call it a multivariable function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[f(x_1,x_2) = 3x_1+x_2\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphs of functions that take in 1 input are lines in a 2D plane, while the graphs of functions that take in 2 inputs are surfaces in a 3D space, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To differentiate functions like this, we find the derivative with respect to one of the variables (denoted by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_i\)&lt;/span&gt; in this case). This type of derivative is known as a partial derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a partial derivative is very similar to finding a normal derivative: we get the limit as x approaches 0. But instead of having just &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x+a)-f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)\)&lt;/span&gt;, since the function takes in more than one input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}&amp;amp;\ \ \ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n) \\ &amp;amp;= \lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_1,x_2..x_i+a..x_n)-f(x_1,x_2..x_i..x_n)}{(x_i+a)-x_i}\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do a partial differentiation, we simply pretend that other variables in the function are constants as we differentiate the function with respect to the chosen input. Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align}f(x,a,b,c) &amp;amp;= x^5+2ax+10b^{9}+log_{a}(c) \\\\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c) &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^5+2ax+10C^{9}+log_{C}(C)) \\ &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^5+2Cx+C) \\ &amp;amp;= 5x^4+2C \\ &amp;amp;= 5x^4+2a \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;added on 29th Oct, at 5PM (SG Timezone, +8): [edited a couple of times around 8 30PM to express the idea of tangent space in a more clear and concise way. And corrected some mistakes I made in the analogy of tangent plane.]&lt;/small&gt; Upon differentiating the function, we need to replace the remaining &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt; back with the corresponding variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align} g(x,a,b,c) &amp;amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c) \\ &amp;amp;= 5x^4+2C = 5x^4+2a \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,a,b,c)\)&lt;/span&gt; tells you about how an infinitesimal change in the input &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; would affect the output &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x,a,b,c)\)&lt;/span&gt; when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt; remains unchangeable. To get the numerical value for the derivative, it is sometimes necessary to put an actual value into these variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align} g(1,2,0,0) &amp;amp;= 629 \\g(1,3,0,0) &amp;amp;= 631 \end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of functions with 1 input at one point (&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x,f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt;) can be represented by a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentLine.html&quot;&gt;tangent lines&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is specified. Meanwhile, the representation for the derivative of functions with 2 inputs at points(&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2)\)&lt;/span&gt;) where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is specified is a plane (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangentPlane.html&quot;&gt;tangent plane&lt;/a&gt;), for functions with 3 input it is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space&quot;&gt;3D space&lt;/a&gt; (3D &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space&quot;&gt;tangent space&lt;/a&gt;), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;31.849056603774&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal differentiation (single-input functions). To obtain a numerical value for the rate of change at a certain point is to obtain the slope of the tangent line at that point: there is only 1 slope because there is only one single line going across one single &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((x,f(x))\)&lt;/span&gt;. To do it we just need to specify &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; since &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; is only dependent on &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph of a two-variable function is a 2 dimensional surface in 3 dimensional space, so each point can be represented by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((x_1,x_2,f(x_1,x_2))\)&lt;/span&gt;, where the value of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x_1,x_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is dependent to both &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative with respect to any one of the variable (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;) when the variable (this case, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt;) is specific is a value dependent to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(f(x_1,x_2)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;. So it is no longer a tangent line across one point, but a tangent plane across infinitely many points whose &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1 = \text{the specific value}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is why, if we want to get an actual numerical value for the slope, we need to specify &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to tangent of higher dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Yes, And – How to be effective in the theatre of work</title>
<link>https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178&quot;&gt;Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Johnstone &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;impro&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tomcritchlow.com/images/Impro-by-Keith-Johnstone.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I loved the book and as Venkatesh said &lt;em&gt;‘it is a textbook that teaches you how to see the world differently.’&lt;/em&gt; so consider it recommended.&lt;/span&gt; . It’s a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly &lt;em&gt;how to teach&lt;/em&gt; improvisational theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I’ve created a four-part series covering the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work&lt;/strong&gt;. This post looks at the central problem of “performing” work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System&lt;/strong&gt;. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We’ll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 3 - Generative Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the “Yes! and…” exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 4 - Status Switching&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally we explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of “status switching” in order to be successful inside client organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter is below, the remaining will come out over the next week or so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these do you recognize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of modern knowledge work is performance… In fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The office is a theatre, and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - &lt;strong&gt;for knowledge work, the performance of the work &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in truth - how else could it function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as we might like to think of organizations as rational machines - the reality is that companies are social organizations and people interacting with people is the way decisions are made and how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this theatre of human work it’s crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted - in fact quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without performance work gets sidelined, ignored or worse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11.957219251337&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation’s future work. &lt;strong&gt;A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.”&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038&quot;&gt;why your hard work sits on the shelf and what to do about it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433&quot;&gt;this excellent Twitter thread from Maxim&lt;/a&gt; shows the value in caring deeply about the presentation and context of the work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;6.010101010101&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nobody ever picks the third, wacky, design direction.&lt;/p&gt;
— Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 1, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the “performance” of work look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Presentations of your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hallway chats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:1 conversations to build alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crafting the wrapper and positioning of your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the language of your work to match others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including wider contexts of the organization, the industry and the market in your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformating your presentations to fit other team’s strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and much more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the theatre of work the performance of work is intimately tied to the work itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many employees attempt to hide or ignore the performance of work and the politics of the organization. They imagine that this public sphere of voice and politics is wasted energy or somehow “unfair” &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;unfair&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Yes actually internal company politics and performance &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unfair but changing that is not the scope of this post…&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-present-public-and-acting-with-voice&quot;&gt;Being present, public and acting with voice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think of the office as a theatre for work the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; meaningful way forward is through this sphere of politics and voice. As Venkatesh Rao from Ribbonfarm outlines in his post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-history/&quot;&gt;how to make history&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do not appear in public through labor, let alone make history. Laboring humans are fungible as individuals, and only consequential actors with a political voice en masse&lt;/strong&gt; (whether organized in egalitarian ways as a working class or non-egalitarian ways as a patriarchy, or ethno-nationalist clientelistic identity group). […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If labor is about blending into the processes of nature, and making about interrupting and slowing it to create a durable world, action is about free behaviors that make history.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ideas of “being public” and “exercising voice” both have relatively specific meanings in the Hannah Arendt sense and I’d encourage you to spend time reading here if you’re not familiar &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;arendt&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Handily Venkatesh has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/12/21/the-computational-condition/&quot;&gt;more formal summary of Hannah Arendt’s work here&lt;/a&gt; - the first 22 slides are most of what you need for this post.&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples that might help explain opportunities for being public and having voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example #1: choosing to take a position on something that situates &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; in the company’s world. A great example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611&quot;&gt;Steve Yegge’s platform rant&lt;/a&gt;. Note how closely Steve is situated in the narrative here - it’s not simply an observation of the market but of taking a position on the world that situates Google, Amazon and Steve. This can feel daunting but ask yourself the last time you showed up in Slack to post something that has voice? To say something about the organization…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example #2: asking questions in public forums (all-hands, quarterly business updates etc). These are opportunities where executives are inviting public voice - they’re asking for people to take positions and have opinions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are an infinite number of other situations where voice and being public are possible &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;speech&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I’ve not delved into it but I think there are insights to be had from studying &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/HowToDoThingsWithWordsAUSTIN&quot;&gt;speech act theory&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/span&gt; … but most employees would rather shy away from these instead of embracing them as part of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestrating performances for your work is the key to more influence and more impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-stage-left-the-consultant&quot;&gt;Enter Stage Left: The Consultant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but so far what we’re describing is the reality of the working world. Now let’s situate the consultant in the theatre of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The luxury that full time employees gain is the ability to script and rehearse their performances - to plan ahead. The consultant is like an improv actor thrust into a play mid-performance, forced to find ways to fit in, go with the flow and steer the performance all while &lt;em&gt;on stage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example - full time employees get the luxury of being involved in 2020 planning. &lt;strong&gt;Consultants are an outcome of 2020 planning&lt;/strong&gt; and so get brought in mid-performance to course correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultants that attempt to halt the performance cause pain and typically don’t stick around. Instead consultants that accept and embrace their nature as improv actors thrive and become integrated into the great performance of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-theatre-of-work-is-an-improv-theatre&quot;&gt;The Theatre of Work is an Improv Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consultant, attempting to tightly script and design the performance of the work will inevitably lead to &lt;strong&gt;missed timings, missed context or missed feedback&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missed timings&lt;/strong&gt; - As a consultant you’re often working less than 5-days a week with a client. So you’re slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client’s organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missed context&lt;/strong&gt; - Because you’re not a full-time employee (even if you’re working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. &lt;strong&gt;Tightly scripting a performance doesn’t leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missed feedback&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org&lt;/strong&gt; (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit queues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you’re aiming for. It’s the essence of why Venkatesh’s idea of client “sparring” &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sparring&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;More on sparring here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://venkateshrao.com/&quot;&gt;venkateshrao.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the work we can’t leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you’re reacting to work mid-performance half of what you’re reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one non-obvious idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-serendipity-deficit-of-consultants--manufacturing-improv-sessions&quot;&gt;The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp;amp; Manufacturing Improv Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I say “spontaneous” because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it’s often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be manufacturing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember - if you’re a consultant in a client’s office two days a week you’re operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-think-on-your-feet-without-bullshitting&quot;&gt;How to think on your feet without bullshitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all else however, you need to embrace a level of “thinking on your feet” - it’s essential to the consultant’s work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “thinking on your feet” is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with “difficult” questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that’s being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it’s the executive asking two questions at once - firstly “how much do you know?” and secondly “can you improv?” to understand how useful you’re going to be in the theatre of work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately - in the theatre of work there’s a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I’m forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we’re often the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt; in the industry… And sometimes we’re &lt;em&gt;experts&lt;/em&gt; at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;industry&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s a little guide to avoiding bullshit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp;amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language, acronyms and buzzwords of the client’s business. If they call it “earned marketing” you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client’s CMS and the market’s CMS (for example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don’t seem to make sense. No pretending. Don’t adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It’s very common that the number or stat you’re using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don’t concede the idea but also don’t try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they’re wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don’t be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there’s one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won’t or can’t work. Except… this is a mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we’re going to talk about that in the next post…. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/&quot;&gt;Optimism as an Operating System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google AdWords charged me for clicks in Istanbul while location-targeting the US</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;5.7874015748031&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;dm&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n dn do dp dq&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o n&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@siggi?source=post_page-----e705b3bdc8a5----------------------&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Siggi Simonarson&quot; class=&quot;r dr ds dt&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/2*zjw5NvsgZjf10xTzOdNSrg.png&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fa18&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;Three months ago, I &lt;a class=&quot;at cg fs ft fu fv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@siggi/what-ive-been-building-since-leaving-google-8512ef7e25e2&quot;&gt;quit my job&lt;/a&gt; at Google to start my own company. This past week, I decided that I wanted to get a feel for how much it would cost to acquire new users for our app through paid channels. Having been a Googler for over 5 years (2 of which were as a software engineer on the AdWords team), my instinct was to start with Google Ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8678&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;I set up a small search campaign to drive traffic to my subscription page. After what seemed like an eternity waiting for approval on my creatives, my ads were serving and I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;11b9&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;My past 3 months have been spent building &lt;a href=&quot;http://usehyperlink.com/&quot; class=&quot;at cg fs ft fu fv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; that lets you get push notifications when your links get clicked on, so I was excited to start receiving push notifications as the AdWords traffic started to roll in. I put unique url parameters in my creatives so I could distinguish this ad traffic from organic visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;329b&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;I waited — excitedly checking my phone for notifications with the ref=adwords url parameter. A few hours went by and then, when I was least expecting it, I got my first click!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;895d&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;Two more clicks quickly followed. I was excited that my notifications were working properly — but was confused to see that all 3 of the notifications said the clicks came from &lt;strong class=&quot;fg gt&quot;&gt;Istanbul&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b8ae&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;The location I display in the notification come from Google’s own GCP &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/user-defined-request-headers&quot; class=&quot;at cg fs ft fu fv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;request headers&lt;/a&gt; which are determined based on the users IP address. My initial reaction was that I must have forgotten to enable location targeting, so I quickly opened up AdWords and checked the settings tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0725&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;The location settings were there — I was only targeting the United States. I was also a little shocked that I was &lt;strong class=&quot;fg gt&quot;&gt;charged&lt;/strong&gt; for all three of those clicks, given that all three of them came from the same IP address in Turkey in very quick succession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1098&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;I asked a friend who’d spent more time than I implementing AdWords campaigns what he thought about this (in the meantime, I got a notification for another AdWords click from &lt;strong class=&quot;fg gt&quot;&gt;Kafr Abu Sir, Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;). He mentioned there were some advanced location settings that I should check out. I dug into the advanced Location settings and discovered these three options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;b86e&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;None of these three options would give me the targeting settings that I want (U.S. only). There is enough wiggle-room in the wording of each of these options that I could still be charged for clicks in Turkey and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e369&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;So this is my warning to my fellow advertisers out there — if you think you’re only targeting certain locations, you’re probably getting clicks from outside of those locations. I have a strategy in mind that I might try out if this remains such a high percentage of my clicks (still currently at 100%, but a small sample size). It involves manually going in and excluding all of the countries that are not the United Sates. In the meantime, I’m going to be keeping a close eye on my ad clicks that are coming in with &lt;a href=&quot;http://usehyperlink.com/&quot; class=&quot;at cg fs ft fu fv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cf6a&quot; class=&quot;fe ff dc bk fg b fh fi fj fk fl fm fn fo fp fq fr&quot;&gt;And to the folks back on the AdWords team, it’d be great if there was an option to respect the location targeting settings that we select. At the very least, it seems like the default option shouldn’t allow for such a high percentage of clicks to come from outside of the targeted countries.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ISOC sold the .org registry to Ethos Capital for $1.1B</title>
<link>https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/advancing-the-internet-societys-mission-into-the-future</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/advancing-the-internet-societys-mission-into-the-future</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;By Andrew Sullivan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our continued interest to be transparent about the details of the agreement regarding Ethos Capital’s acquisition of Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society, earlier today we disclosed the purchase price of the transaction: $1.135 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Internet Society will receive this as a fund that it will invest as an endowment, and will use the earnings that come from this investment to fund its work to fulfil its mission on a broader scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This funding is sufficient to provide the Internet Society with broadly equivalent annual earnings we currently receive from PIR. And through responsible, well managed investment, we believe this fund will provide a comparable level of funding to the Internet Society in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this way, we will be able to continue to operate to deliver efforts that are aligned with our focus of expanding the reach of the Internet, and making it stronger. The Internet Society will build a new governance structure for the new endowment mechanism that delivers this money, which will be treated as a separate supporting organization in the same way PIR is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Governance structures for the endowment will be proposed following consultation with experts in non-profit endowment management. Once options are put forward, the Internet Society will run an open consultation process with the community to determine the most appropriate governance structure to put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through this funding mechanism and the investments that we will be able to make through the endowment, the Internet Society will no longer be reliant on one revenue stream from one company, in one industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our mission is to support and promote the development of the Internet around the world — an Internet that is open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy. Our agreement with Ethos Capital will allow us to accelerate our initiatives based on more sustainable, dependable funding, to enable us to commit to longer-term investments and to do much more to ensure that the Internet is there for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Arrest Of U.S. Citizen For Assisting North Korea In Evading Sanctions</title>
<link>https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-united-states-citizen-assisting-north-korea</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-united-states-citizen-assisting-north-korea</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, John C. Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Brown, Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) Counterintelligence Division, and William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the FBI, announced today the unsealing of a criminal complaint charging VIRGIL GRIFFITH, a United States citizen, with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) by traveling to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“DPRK” or “North Korea”) in order deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.  GRIFFITH was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport yesterday and will be presented in federal court in Los Angeles later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated:  “As alleged, Virgil Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions.  In allegedly doing so, Griffith jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General John Demers said:  “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions.  By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said:  “There are deliberate reasons sanctions have been levied on North Korea.  The country and its leader pose a literal threat to our national security and that of our allies.  Mr. Griffith allegedly traveled to North Korea without permission from the federal government, and with knowledge what he was doing was against the law.  We cannot allow anyone to evade sanctions, because the consequences of North Korea obtaining funding, technology, and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk.  It’s even more egregious that a U.S. citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-united-states-citizen-assisting-north-korea#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;[1]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to the IEEPA and Executive Order 13466, United States Persons are prohibited from exporting any goods, services, or technology to the DPRK without a license from Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In or about April 2019, GRIFFITH traveled to the DPRK to attend and present at the “Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference” (the “DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference”).  Despite that the U.S. Department of State had denied GRIFFITH permission to travel to the DPRK, GRIFFITH presented at the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, knowing that doing so violated sanctions against the DPRK.  At no time did GRIFFITH obtain permission from OFAC to provide goods, services, or technology to the DPRK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, GRIFFITH and other attendees discussed how the DPRK could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions.  GRIFFITH’s presentation at the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference had been approved by DPRK officials and focused on, among other things, how blockchain technology, including a “smart contract,” could be used to benefit the DPRK.  GRIFFITH identified several DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference attendees who appeared to work for the North Korean government, and who, during his presentation, asked GRIFFITH specific questions about blockchain and cryptocurrency and prompted discussions on technical aspects of those technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, GRIFFITH began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency between the DPRK and South Korea, despite knowing that assisting with such an exchange would violate sanctions against the DPRK.  GRIFFITH also encouraged other U.S. citizens to travel to North Korea, including to attend the same DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference the following year.  Finally, GRIFFITH announced his intention to renounce his U.S. citizenship and began researching how to purchase citizenship from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;*                      *                     *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIRGIL GRIFFITH, 36, is a resident of Singapore and citizen of the United States.  GRIFFITH is charged with conspiring to violate the IEEPA, which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and its New York Field Office, Counterintelligence Division, and thanked the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, for their assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is being handled by the Office’s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kimberly Ravener, Michael K. Krouse, and Kyle A. Wirshba are in charge of the case, with assistance from Trial Attorneys Christian Ford and Matthew J. McKenzie of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge in the Complaint is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;By Don Monroe&lt;br/&gt;Communications of the ACM, November 2019, Vol. 62 No. 11, Pages 13-15&lt;br/&gt;10.1145/3360909&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;imageWithCaptionLeft&quot; id=&quot;asset-35765&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Maxwell's demon, illustration&quot; src=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/system/assets/0003/5765/101919_Info-Is-Physics.large.jpg?1571688529&amp;amp;1571688529&quot; title=&quot;Maxwell's demon, illustration&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficient error-correcting codes for quantum computing recently emerged from mathematical models used to study black holes. This surprising finding joins to a long list of profound connections between information and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing examples began as paradoxes or &quot;thought experiments&quot; that are hard to test experimentally. Physicists take them seriously because they challenge core concepts and may require revolutionary theoretical changes that could have practical consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Physics of Computation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hints that information has physical significance emerged in the 1800s, as researchers connected the somewhat mysterious thermodynamic quantity known as entropy to the information needed to describe a particular physical configuration. In this view, the progressive loss of information about an orderly initial state leads to the inexorable increases in entropy of an isolated system demanded by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which constrains the efficiency of engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond such statistical accounting, individual bits of information can have direct physical consequences, as illustrated by thermodynamics pioneer James Clerk Maxwell. He suggested that a &quot;demon&quot; that could see approaching molecules could merely open or close a trapdoor between two compartments of gas to let slow and fast molecules accumulate on opposites sides. The resulting temperature difference, seemingly without any entropy increase elsewhere, would violate the Second Law. (Maxwell's tricky creature also inspired the name of programs that operate behind the scenes in some operating systems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3370000/3360909/uf1.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1022,height=754'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;uf1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3370000/3360909/uf1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure. The lattice structure of carbon atoms in a diamond crystal contains a nitrogen-vacancy center with surrounding carbon nuclear spins. Researchers have demonstrated reliable quantum state transfer of photon polarization into a carbon isotope nuclear spin coupled to the nitrogen-vacancy center, based on photon-electron Bell state measurement by photon absorption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicists resolved the paradox by noting that Maxwell's demon eventually would need to erase the information it had gleaned about the molecules, and that this erasure would create enough entropy to preserve the Second Law. Overcoming the erasure of one bit requires an energy expenditure of a few billionths of a picojoule (at room temperature). This puts a lower bound on the energy needed for computation, because the output of a logic gate usually compresses the information in its inputs. Fortunately, current electronics devices use millions of times more energy per operation, so the limit is not (yet) important practically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quantum Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this fundamental limit could in principle be avoided, however, by making all computations reversible, retaining enough information to reconstruct the original input. For researchers working on candidate components for quantum computers, this turns out to be immediately relevant, because these devices always operate reversibly, and this needs to be incorporated in circuit design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, according to quantum mechanics, the mathematical evolution of any system is restricted to &quot;unitary&quot; transformations, which &quot;basically means that whatever information you have, it always is there in some form,&quot; said theoretical physicist Brian Swingle of the University of Maryland. &quot;Maybe it's very hard to read it out in some sense, but it's there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum information should still be conserved even when it is scrambled by interactions with the environment, which can be viewed as a larger quantum system. Although such interactions are often viewed as uncontrolled noise that causes &quot;decoherence&quot; that scrambles quantum information, quantum error-correction schemes exploit the overall reversibility of the combined system to ensure the desired information is preserved where it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, &quot;classical&quot; (non-quantum) physics also follows microscopic equations that pay no attention to the direction of time. Indeed, physicists have long struggled to describe how such deterministic processes lead to the apparent loss of information embodied in increasing entropy, since the final state contains all of the details needed to reconstruct the initial state. &quot;Information is just as preserved classically as in quantum,&quot; said Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Beyond the Horizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in the quantum realm, however, that information has raised the most profound conceptual challenges. This is most apparent in the field of quantum gravity, which aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, quantum mechanics plays out on a &quot;stage&quot; of unchanging spacetime, Swingle said. &quot;If you try to make that stage dynamical, as happens in general relativity, where the geometry of spacetime is changing as a function of time, then combining those two things is hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gravitational and quantum frameworks can usually agree to disagree, since they apply to very large and small scales respectively. However, their conflict becomes unavoidable for physicists studying black holes, which are both extremely massive and relatively compact. In this reconciliation effort, information plays a central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once anything falls within a black hole's &quot;event horizon,&quot; from which even light cannot escape, it should have no more influence on outside space. In particular, any information embedded in the infalling material is forever inaccessible. However, in the 1970s, Stephen Hawking of the U.K.'s University of Cambridge suggested that normally ephemeral pairs of particles that appear in the quantum-mechanical vacuum could be ripped apart at the horizon, with one sucked inside and the other escaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3370000/3360909/uf2.jpg&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=984,height=360'); return false;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;uf2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; src=&quot;http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/3370000/3360909/uf2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure. A schematic of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this escaping &quot;Hawking radiation&quot; is that the black hole will eventually evaporate completely. At that time (usually ridiculously far in the future), information that had been carried in would not just be inaccessible, but gone forever, violating the quantum rule that it is always preserved. Physicists argued about how to resolve this &quot;black-hole information paradox&quot; for decades, but they largely came to accept that the information was somehow carried away in quantum &quot;entanglement&quot; between different radiated particles. In 2004, Hawking famously agreed, conceding a bet with the California Institute of Technology's John Preskill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Universe as a Hologram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important support for this consensus came from a tool proposed in 1997 by Juan Maldacena of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. It is called the AdS/CFT correspondence because it allows a mathematical mapping between a particular model of spacetime (AdS) and a class of quantum models (CFT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, although the gravitational and quantum systems are equivalent, the quantum system has one fewer spatial dimension, somewhat like the surface of the gravitational system. This is an example of a &quot;holographic&quot; universe, so called because it resembles the way that a flat holographic film can encapsulate a three-dimensional image. Black holes constructed in this idealized universe can evaporate while conserving information. Carroll said the hope is that looking at such explicit examples will &quot;reveal general principles,&quot; although he stresses that other approaches should also be explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AdS/CFT framework has also yielded other insights, including new ways to study complex quantum-mechanical systems like superconductors by looking at the corresponding gravitational model. It also revealed the surprising quantum error-correcting codes referred to at the start of the article, in which the surface information captures a subtle redundancy in the way information is encoded in the higher-dimensional bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Cosmic Firewall?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking's concession did not end the controversies about black holes, because of ambiguity when one particle of an entangled pair falls in. Traditionally, this particle would remain entangled with its partner outside, sharing its quantum information. If this information is also carried away in the Hawking radiation, however, that violates a quantum rule known as &quot;monogamy of entanglement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, physicists thought this conflict might be tolerable because no one could ever compare the information inside and outside, but in 2012 a group of physicists showed that this loophole fails right at the horizon. Instead, they proposed that passing through the horizon destroys the entanglement, creating a huge sheet of energy at the horizon known as the &quot;firewall.&quot; This idea is repellent to many physicists, because a guiding principle for Einstein was that falling freely through space feels the same everywhere, with &quot;no drama&quot; at the event horizon. Other researchers have proposed other ideas, for example that the information carried in is conveyed to a different part of space by a &quot;wormhole&quot; and thus survives the evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These radical ideas, driven by the information paradox, threaten to restructure fundamental aspects of how physicists understand the universe. Although there remains no consensus on the resolution, Carroll said, it has &quot;settled into something that many people agree is a problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/11/240356-information-is-physics/fulltext#PageTop&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Emergent Spacetime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if wormholes were not exotic enough, Carroll, Swingle, and other physicists are exploring the idea that the entire structure of spacetime emerges from entangled quantum information. This alternative approach, sometimes called &quot;It from Qubit,&quot; starts with abstract points, with no sense of space between them at all, said Swingle. &quot;Then you start entangling them in some characteristic pattern, and that pattern can take on a geometric structure, in that you follow a link from one particle to another particle, eventually you have some sense of being able to go somewhere, some sense of distance, some sense of space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carroll, Swingle, and other physicists are exploring the idea that the entire structure of spacetime emerges from entangled quantum information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ambitious scheme remains a work in progress and may not prove successful, but there is no doubt that information will continue to guide fundamental thinking about physics. &quot;Taking an information-theoretic point of view,&quot; Swingle said, can provide a &quot;unifying framework to think about lots of different things. It's sort of a software versus a hardware view of the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Syntax Highlighting Is Backwards (2018)</title>
<link>https://www.benkuhn.net/syntax</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.benkuhn.net/syntax</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Most code editors color different pieces of your program in different ways. For instance, they’ll make keywords like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bold and bright so that you notice when you’ve misspelled them. They’ll make non-executable parts like comments and documentation fainter so that you know that the computer isn’t seeing that part of the program. Take this example in Pycharm colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; frobnicate(swizzle):
    &lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;Frobnicates the given swizzle.&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But isn’t this exactly backwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want the syntax of my language to get out of my way, not jump into the foreground. I can easily recognize keywords, and I’d rather focus on the parts of the code with higher information density—method names, arguments, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your code is locally readable, then there are only two times you need comments: (a) high level overviews and signposts; or (b) to call out some tricky non-local effect of the code. These are the two most important and least straightforward parts of programming: I want them &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt;, not faded out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take as an example the following function definition from the Zulip codebase (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/83d422d5bc7008725d38fb2a29d8da925e6234dd/zerver/lib/avatar_hash.py#L30&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; user_avatar_path(user_profile: UserProfile) -&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bi&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;# WARNING: If this method is changed, you may need to do
    # a migration similar to
    # zerver/migrations/0060_move_avatars_to_be_uid_based.py .&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; user_avatar_path_from_ids(
        user_profile.id, user_profile.realm_id)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; is the least important part of this snippet—I know it’s a function. The comment is way more important: if I update the code without reading it, I’ll probably ship a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if we flipped these two styles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw2&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; user_avatar_path(user_profile: UserProfile) -&amp;gt; str:
    &lt;span class=&quot;doc2&quot;&gt;# WARNING: If this method is changed, you may need to do
    # a migration similar to
    # zerver/migrations/0060_move_avatars_to_be_uid_based.py .&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw2&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; user_avatar_path_from_ids(
        user_profile.id, user_profile.realm_id)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems better! The keywords fade into the background and I definitely won’t forget to write a migration. I’m not convinced about bolding every comment—it’s a little obtrusive—but I don’t have any better ideas and I’d rather read too many comments than not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using this color scheme for a few weeks now and it’s been fine so far! The most noticeable effect is that my source code is way less noisy and distracting. I think I’m paying attention to comments more (and leaving them to be stale less often), but that’s a lot harder to tell so I can’t say for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;11.852280955829&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really do want to find something better than bold for comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.8930693069307&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious why many languages today display keywords in bold so I looked up the history of syntax highlighting on Wikipedia. It sounds like the first IDE to bold keywords may have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting#cite_ref-macpascal_9-0&quot;&gt;MacPascal&lt;/a&gt;, which was written for a monochrome display. In that case it makes sense: with a monochrome display and one font, they could either make keywords bold or make everything else bold, and keywords was the less-intrusive option. But now that we have 16-million-color displays, maybe it’s time to revisit that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.9090909090909&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about this after discovering Robert Melton’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertmelton.com/posts/syntax-highlighting-off/&quot;&gt;No Frils&lt;/a&gt; Vim theme, which I noticed also has an option “to turn on high contrast comments rather than the default faded style, for projects where the comments are not deceit and lies.” Maybe the deceit and lies problem is why this isn’t more popular? On the other hand, it seems like fading out comments and docstrings probably makes the staleness problem a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also probably a lot easier to do this in codebases with familiar and obvious naming conventions (e.g. classes are &lt;code&gt;CamelCase&lt;/code&gt;, functions are verbs, decorators are adjectives, timestamps start with &lt;code&gt;when_&lt;/code&gt;…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to search around for any systematic studies of what kinds of syntax highlighting help, and I couldn’t find a single one. I’d love any pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>Syntax highlighting is backwards</og:title>
<og:description>Most code editors color different pieces of your program in different ways. For instance, they’ll make keywords like if bold and bright so that you notice when you’ve misspelled them. They’ll make non-executable parts like comments and documentation fainter so that you know that the computer isn’t seeing that part of the program. But isn’t that exactly backwards?</og:description>
