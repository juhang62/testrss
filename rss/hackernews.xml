<title>Stable 1.2 Gigabit/s Internet achieved in moving train in Switzerland</title>
<link>https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/news/2020/10/21-mehr-bandbreite-im-zug.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/news/2020/10/21-mehr-bandbreite-im-zug.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A four-kilometre antenna corridor was constructed along the railway line at Lake Walen for the test, in conjunction with network equipment supplier Ericsson. The proximity of the antenna to devices means the transmitting power is lower and the coverage along the railway corridor is more targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a step-by-step procedure, numerous combinations (4G and 5G mobile phone generations, seating position, type of train car, transmitting power, train windows, mast antennas, smartphone models, etc.) were measured and analysed over more than 200 train journeys. The project has shown that the antenna corridor is possible and offers good performance. Download speeds of over 1.2 Gbit/s were possible on a moving train with a combination of 4G and 5G. The 5G response time was four times shorter than 4G – an impressive 8 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to network coverage, safety-critical applications on rail transport are another consideration. The existing GSM-R railway communication network standard will be replaced in the coming years by the new Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS). Good mobile phone coverage is also therefore crucial for rail companies as well as passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>1Password for Linux beta</title>
<link>https://blog.1password.com/1password-for-linux-beta-is-now-open/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.1password.com/1password-for-linux-beta-is-now-open/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;introduction&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Buckle up Linux Desktop users! We just opened an awesome ride that we’d love for you to join us on. 🎢 🙌🏼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited to announce our first beta release of 1Password for Linux. That’s right – we now have a full-featured desktop app for Linux which you can use to quickly find, edit, and organize your items! And it looks gorgeous, too! 😍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/linux-beta/1password-linux-hero.png&quot; alt=&quot;Main 1Password window, unlocked running on Ubuntu&quot; title=&quot;Main 1Password window, unlocked running on Ubuntu&quot; width=&quot;584.05px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned for official release early next year, we couldn’t wait to share the news with you so today we’re unveiling a beta so you can join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-true-linux-app&quot;&gt;A true Linux app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new app is built to meet the security and performance expectations of Linux users. Its backend is written completely in Rust, a secure systems programming language that has made a lot of waves in the Linux community. We’re especially proud to be using the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/briansmith/ring&quot;&gt;ring crypto library&lt;/a&gt; to power the end-to-end encryption that keeps your data safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used this new foundation to bring you the 1Password experience you know and love to Linux and extended it further with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick Find and intelligent search suggestions 🔎&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautiful new look and feel based on our new design language 😍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move item dialog allows you to easily share items and see who they are shared with 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data export ✈️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock screen shows all your accounts and supports using different passwords 🔐&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watchtower Dashboard provides suggestions on how to improve your Security Score 🎯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these great improvements we’ve tailored the app to integrate with Desktop Linux:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple and secure installs using apt and dnf package managers 📦&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic Dark Mode selection based on your GTK theme 🌓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open network locations (FTP, SSH, SMB) 🌍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiling window manager support and descriptive window titles 🏠&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlock with your Linux user account, including biometrics ☝️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System tray icon for staying unlocked while closed 📌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X11 clipboard integration and clearing ✂️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard shortcuts ⌨️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is just what’s available in the first beta. We have many more great things planned to make 1Password for Linux even greater. 😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/posts/2020/linux-beta/devlists-penguin.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Linux enthusiast reading a newspaper announcing 1Password for Linux&quot; title=&quot;A Linux enthusiast reading a newspaper announcing 1Password for Linux&quot; width=&quot;184.05px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beta-users-welcome&quot;&gt;Beta users welcome!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re really excited about what’s now possible with 1Password on Linux and all the incredible things we have planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As thrilled as we are it’s important to remember 1Password for Linux is still in beta. Expect some sharp turns and sudden drops so please keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such this initial release should be used &lt;strong&gt;for testing and validation purposes only and is not suitable for business critical environments&lt;/strong&gt;. For a stable experience on Linux you’ll want to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.1password.com/explore/whats-new-1password-x/&quot;&gt;1Password X&lt;/a&gt; in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-accounts-for-open-source-teams&quot;&gt;Free accounts for open source teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new app is built on great open source projects like the Rust programming language for the underlying logic, and React for a responsive component-based UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an app for Linux wouldn’t have been possible without these giant shoulders to stand upon so we want to give back to the free software community. If you work on an open source team that needs a password manager, open a pull request in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source&quot;&gt;1Password for Open Source Projects&lt;/a&gt; repo and we’ll give you and everybody on your team a free account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your contributions and making the world a better place. 🤗❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;apt-get-install-1password&quot;&gt;apt-get install 1password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re excited to report issues, work with us to resolve them, and update to verify fixes, then you’re welcome to get onboard. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.1password.com/getting-started-linux/&quot;&gt;Get to know 1Password for Linux&lt;/a&gt; for installation and troubleshooting instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We maintain signed apt and rpm package repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as well the &lt;a href=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/1password&quot;&gt;Snap store&lt;/a&gt;. We also have an AppImage for as-of-yet unsupported distributions. Let us know what distribution you use and how well 1Password works there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you are as excited about a 1Password Linux app as we are. To discuss this release, report issues, and talk with our development team, please join us in &lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.community/categories/linux-beta&quot;&gt;our Linux forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quibi Holdings LLC is shutting down a mere six months after launching its streaming service, a crash landing for a once highly touted startup that attracted some of the biggest names in Hollywood and had looked to revolutionize how people consume entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streaming service, which served up shows in 5- to 10-minute “chapters” formatted to fit a smartphone screen, has been plagued with problems since its April debut, facing lower-than-expected viewership and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-elliott-management-to-finance-lawsuit-against-streamer-quibi-11588536108&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;a lawsuit from a well-capitalized foe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our failure was not for lack of trying,” founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and Chief Executive Meg Whitman said in an open letter to employees and investors. “We’ve considered and exhausted every option available to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman decided to shut down the company in an effort to return as much capital to investors as possible instead of trying to prolong the life of the company and risk losing more money, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees will be laid off and will be paid a severance, the people said, and Quibi will explore selling the rights to some of its content to other media and technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a video call with employees Wednesday, an emotional Mr. Katzenberg suggested Quibi staffers listen to the song “Get Back Up Again,” sung by actress Anna Kendrick in the animated film “Trolls,” to buoy their spirits, according to people familiar with the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision marks a disappointing turn of events for Mr. Katzenberg, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS&quot;&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Co.&lt;/span&gt; executive and DreamWorks co-founder who pitched the streaming service as a revolutionary new entrant to the video-streaming wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quibi was designed for people who consume entertainment in short increments on their smartphones, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; forced would-be subscribers away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-jeffrey-katzenbergs-on-the-go-streaming-bet-adjusts-to-life-on-the-couch-11588266129&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;the kinds of on-the-go situations&lt;/a&gt; Quibi executives envisioned for its users. Quibi eventually allowed subscribers to watch its shows on their televisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot; media-object type-InsetRichText wrap scope-web|mobileapps article__inset article__inset--type-InsetRichText article__inset--wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Streamer Struggles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the Covid-19 crisis, Quibi had its share of skeptics in the media world, because consumers already had free options for short-form video, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt; YouTube. Quibi’s bet was that it could charge subscriptions by creating higher-end content, and it paid handsomely to develop that programming. Some Quibi executives believed the venture could have been a success, if not for the pandemic, with better execution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-videos-are-goofy-its-strategy-to-dominate-social-media-is-serious-11561780861&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;pointing to the rise of TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, people close to the company said. Some of them believed, for example, that Quibi could pivot to what is known as a freemium model, offering some content free while making customers pay for the top programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quibi, which cost $4.99 a month, also had to compete &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/graphics/streaming-tv-services-quiz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;with a growing number of rivals&lt;/a&gt;, with launches of Walt Disney’s Disney+, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt; Apple TV+, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt; HBO Max and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CMCSA&quot;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Corp.’s&lt;/span&gt; Peacock all occurring in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wednesday’s letter, Mr. Katzenberg and Ms. Whitman said there were “one or two reasons” for Quibi’s failure: The idea behind Quibi either “wasn’t strong enough to justify a stand-alone streaming service” or the service’s launch in the middle of a pandemic was particularly ill-timed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, we will never know, but we suspect it’s been a combination of the two,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of Hollywood was doubtful Quibi would succeed but was willing to sell content to the service. Some large media companies, including AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS Inc., agreed to invest in the platform. Overall, Quibi raised about $1.75 billion from high-profile investors which also included Disney and Comcast’s NBCUniversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call with investors earlier Wednesday, Mr. Katzenberg said the company decided to return $350 million in capital rather than pursue a new strategy that could have attracted additional subscribers but would have required a hefty investment, according to a person familiar with the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spent aggressively to develop its content. Its lineup of star-studded programming included a court show featuring Chrissy Teigen, a romantic comedy with Anna Kendrick and an action thriller starring Christoph Waltz and Liam Hemsworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quibi drew on the deep Hollywood connections of Mr. Katzenberg, who ran Disney’s movie business, co-founded DreamWorks SKG and led its animation spinoff DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., the studio behind “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quibi made the classic mistake of getting too wrapped up in a product vision—videos on the phone—and forgetting about the customer,” said Tien Tzuo, CEO of Zuora, a subscription-management company. “They had great artists and storytellers, and the short-form approach had a lot of promise, just look at the success of TikTok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streaming service attracted blue-chip advertisers including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PEP&quot;&gt;PepsiCo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WMT&quot;&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BUD&quot;&gt;Anheuser-Busch InBev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;SA,&lt;/span&gt; securing about $150 million in ad revenue in the run-up to its launch. Those deals came under strain earlier this year amid lower-than-expected viewership for Quibi’s shows, prompting advertisers to defer their payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Quibi hired a restructuring firm, AlixPartners LLP, to evaluate its options, the people said. It recommended the options to the board of directors this week, laying out a list that included shutting the company down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AlixPartners didn’t respond to a request for comment. The firm previously handled the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM&quot;&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;Co.&lt;/span&gt; and Kmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/katzenberg-tried-to-sell-quibi-content-raising-questions-about-services-future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;The Information earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; that Mr. Katzenberg told people in the media industry he might have to shut down the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to hire AlixPartners came after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-explores-strategic-options-including-a-possible-sale-11600707806&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;starting a process to sell the company&lt;/a&gt;, The Wall Street Journal reported. Quibi pitched suitors including NBCUniversal on a sale, according to people familiar with the matter, but would-be buyers were put off by the fact that Quibi doesn’t own many of the shows it puts on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBCUniversal declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quibi is also fighting a legal battle with interactive-video company Eko, which claims Quibi is violating its patents and has stolen trade secrets. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. is financing the patent lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight centers on a key feature of Quibi’s app that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/streamer-quibi-faces-patent-infringement-claim-over-video-feature-11583775981&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;plays different videos for users&lt;/a&gt; depending on whether they are holding their phone horizontally or vertically. Quibi has denied infringing on Eko’s patents or stealing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The majority of Facebook&amp;#039;s traffic now uses QUIC and HTTP/3</title>
<link>https://engineering.fb.com/networking-traffic/how-facebook-is-bringing-quic-to-billions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://engineering.fb.com/networking-traffic/how-facebook-is-bringing-quic-to-billions/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are replacing the de facto protocol the internet has used for decades with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the latest and most radical step we’ve taken to optimize our network protocols to create a better experience for people on our services. Today, more than 75 percent of our internet traffic uses QUIC and HTTP/3 (we refer to QUIC and HTTP/3 together as QUIC). QUIC has shown significant improvements in several metrics, including request errors, tail latency, response header size, and numerous others that meaningfully affect the experience of people using our apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-3-from-root-to-tip/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;currently developing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;both QUIC and HTTP/3 for standardization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are QUIC and HTTP/3?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broadly speaking, QUIC is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://quicwg.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;replacement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), one of the main protocols for internet communication. QUIC was originally developed internally by Google as Google QUIC, or gQUIC, and was presented to the IETF in 2015. Since then, it has been redesigned and improved by the broader IETF community, forming a new protocol we now call QUIC.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bagder/http3-explained&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is the next iteration of HTTP, the standard protocol for web-based applications and servers. Together, QUIC and HTTP/3 represent the latest and greatest in internet-focused protocols, incorporating decades of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;best practices and lessons that we, Google, and the IETF community learned through running protocols on the internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC and HTTP/3 generally outperform TCP and HTTP/2, which in turn outperform TCP and HTTP/1.1. TCP and HTTP/2 first introduced the concept of allowing a single network connection to support multiple data streams in a process called stream multiplexing. QUIC and HTTP/3 take this one step further by allowing streams to be truly independent by avoiding TCP’s dreaded head of line blocking, where lost packets jam and slow down all streams on a connection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC employs state-of-the-art loss recovery, which allows it to perform better than most TCP implementations under poor network conditions. TCP is also prone to ossification, where the protocol becomes difficult to upgrade because network middleboxes such as firewalls make assumptions about the packets’ format. QUIC avoids this issue by being fully encrypted, making protocol extensibility a first-class citizen and guaranteeing that future improvements can be made. QUIC also allows new ways to instrument, observe, and visualize transport behavior through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quiclog&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QLOG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a JSON-based tracing format designed specifically for QUIC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience-focused protocol development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We developed our own implementation of QUIC, called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookincubator/mvfst&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mvfst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, in order to rapidly test and deploy QUIC on our own systems. We have a history of writing and deploying our own protocol implementations, first with our HTTP client/server library,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/production-engineering/introducing-proxygen-facebook-s-c-http-framework/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proxygen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and following that with the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/android/building-zero-protocol-for-fast-secure-mobile-connections/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zero protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/security/fizz/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fizz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, our TLS 1.3 implementation. Facebook apps utilize both Fizz and Proxygen to communicate with our servers via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngBiMCLxn8Y&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proxygen Mobile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’ve also developed two security solutions for TLS, an extension called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/security/delegated-credentials/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;delegated credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for securing certificates and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/security/dns-over-tls/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;DNS over TLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for encrypting and authenticating web traffic over TLS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Developing and deploying a new transport protocol from scratch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We wanted our new protocol to seamlessly integrate with our existing software and allow our developers to work quickly. As a proving ground, we decided to deploy QUIC on a large subset of Facebook network traffic, specifically internal network traffic that included proxied public traffic to Facebook. If QUIC didn’t work well for internal traffic, we knew it likely wouldn’t work well on the larger internet either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to shaking out bugs and other problematic behaviors, this strategy let us design a method that makes our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/open-source/open-sourcing-katran-a-scalable-network-load-balancer/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;network load balancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;deeply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3284850.3322434&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC-aware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and maintains our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3387514.3405885&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;load balancer’s zero-downtime release guarantees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With this solid foundation in place, we moved toward deploying QUIC to people on the internet. Because of mvfst’s design, we were able to smoothly integrate QUIC support into Proxygen Mobile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Facebook app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Facebook app was our first target for using QUIC on the internet. Facebook has a mature infrastructure that allows us to safely roll out changes to apps in a limited fashion before we release them to billions of people. We began with an experiment in which we enabled QUIC for dynamic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GraphQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;requests in the Facebook app. These are requests that do not have static content such as images and videos in the response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our tests have shown that QUIC offers improvements on several metrics. People on Facebook experienced a 6 percent reduction in request errors, a 20 percent tail latency reduction, and a 5 percent reduction in response header size relative to HTTP/2. This had cascading effects on other metrics as well, indicating that peoples’ experience was greatly enhanced by QUIC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there were regressions. What was most puzzling was that, despite QUIC being enabled only for dynamic requests, we observed increased error rates for static content downloaded with TCP. The root cause of this would be a common theme we’d run into when transitioning traffic to QUIC: App logic was changing the type and quantity of requests for certain types of content based on the speed and reliability of requests for other types of content. So improving one type of request may have had detrimental side effects for others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a heuristic that adapted how aggressively the app requested new static content from the server was tuned in a way that created issues with QUIC. When the app makes a request to, say, load the text content of a News Feed, it waits to see how long this request takes, then determines how many image/video requests to make from there. We found the heuristic was tuned with arbitrary thresholds, which probably worked OK for TCP. But when we switched to QUIC, these thresholds were inaccurate, and the app tried to request too much at once, ultimately causing News Feed to take longer to load.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making it scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next step was to deploy QUIC for static content (e.g., images and videos) in the Facebook apps. Before doing this, however, we had to address two main concerns: the CPU efficiency of mvfst and the effectiveness of our primary congestion control implementation,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Up to this point, mvfst was designed to help developers move quickly and keep up with ever-changing drafts of QUIC. Dynamic requests, whose responses are relatively small compared with those of static requests, do not require significant CPU usage, nor do they put a congestion controller through its paces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To address these concerns, we developed performance testing tools that allowed us to assess CPU usage and how effectively our congestion controller could utilize network resources. We used these tools and synthetic load tests of QUIC in our load balancer to make several improvements. One important area, for example, was optimizing how we pace UDP packets to allow for smoother data transmission. To improve CPU usage, we employed a number of techniques,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;including using generic segmentation offload (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/752956/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GSO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to efficiently send batches of UDP packets at once. We also optimized the data structures and algorithms that handle unacknowledged QUIC data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC for all content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before turning on QUIC for all content in the Facebook app, we partnered with several stakeholders, including our video engineers. They have a deep understanding of the important product metrics and helped us analyze the experimental results in the Facebook app as we enabled QUIC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experiments showed that QUIC had a transformative effect on video metrics in the Facebook app. Mean time between rebuffering (MTBR), a measure of the time between buffering events, improved in aggregate by up to 22 percent, depending on the platform. The overall error count on video requests was reduced by 8 percent. The rate of video stalls was reduced by 20 percent. Several other metrics, including meta-metrics, considering a variety of factors and specifically outlier conditions, were significantly improved as well. QUIC improved the video viewing experience, with an outsized impact on networks with relatively poorer conditions, especially those in emerging markets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the path to these results came with roadblocks of its own. Similar to our experience with dynamic content, we encountered heuristics in the app that had been tuned to TCP’s behavior. For example, the apps on iOS and Android had differing mechanisms for estimating the available download bandwidth. These estimators sometimes overestimated the available bandwidth when using QUIC, causing the app to play a higher-quality video than the network could support and resulting in stalls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also had to tune and iterate the flow control parameters. Flow control limits the amount of data a receiver is willing to buffer from the sender. The Facebook app had a statically defined flow control limit for HTTP/2 that was implicitly tuned for TCP and did not perform well with QUIC. It took some experimental iteration for us to find the new optimal flow control value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instagram and beyond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;QUIC’s performance on the Facebook app has been a testament to its ability to improve peoples’ experience on the internet, even on rich and complex applications like Facebook. In the future, we plan to continue to utilize more of QUIC’s existing features, such as connection migration and true 0-RTT connection establishment, as well as invest in improvements to congestion control and loss recovery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We deployed QUIC to the Instagram apps as well, using the same strategies as our Facebook deployment — testing it on a small percentage of Instagram’s traffic and then scaling up. Today, QUIC is deployed on Instagram for iOS and Instagram for Android. Both versions of Instagram have seen metrics that are comparable to or better than those of the Facebook app. Facebook and Instagram on the web also have QUIC enabled, so as more web browsers enable support for QUIC, as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google has recently done for Chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10111/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple has done for Safari beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, even more people will benefit from the improvements. Beyond Instagram, we believe we can bring the benefits of QUIC to every experience in our family of apps, with QUIC eventually representing not just the majority but the entirety of Facebook’s internet traffic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The IETF is on track to finalize the QUIC protocol as a request for comments (RFC) document sometime in 2021. Once this happens, even more websites, applications, and networking libraries will start offering QUIC for general use. In the very near future, new protocols like QUIC will be essential to unlocking innovative internet applications. For us, QUIC is a starting point from which we can continue to enhance people’s Facebook experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are so many people within and outside of Facebook who have made this deployment possible. We would like to thank everyone who has participated in the IETF QUIC working group over the past several years, tirelessly debating and designing QUIC. The working group comprises a multitude of individuals from many different backgrounds who have produced a truly remarkable protocol in a relatively short period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook can track almost all your web activity and tie it to your Facebook identity. If that’s too much for you, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/?src=external-www.mozilla.org-facebookcontainer&amp;amp;utm_source=www.mozilla.org-facebookcontainer&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;Facebook Container extension&lt;/a&gt; isolates your identity into a separate container tab, making it harder for Facebook to track you on the web outside of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;So it finally happened: the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Google, alleging anticompetitive behavior under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. And, as far as I can tell, everyone is disappointed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download&quot;&gt;the DOJ’s case&lt;/a&gt;; Nilay Patel’s tweets were representative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are Google, you have been batting down most of the DOJ's argument in Europe, which has stronger antitrust laws and more aggressive regulators, for YEARS. This complaint is like a vacation for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— nilay patel (@reckless) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1318621728101326849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak to Barr’s motivations for launching this lawsuit now, although it has been frustrating to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/uber-layoffs-t-mobile-sprint-merger-approved-additional-notes-on-the-merger/&quot;&gt;the degree to which antitrust seems to have been politicized&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-need-for-neutrality/&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T-Time Warner case&lt;/a&gt;; I can understand the instinctual skepticism and suspicion that this was timed for the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That noted, I think the conventional wisdom about the specifics of this lawsuit are mistaken: I believe the particulars of the Justice Department’s complaint have been foreshadowed for a long time, and make for a case stronger than most of Europe’s; if the lawsuit fails in court — as it very well may — it also points to where Congress should act to restrain the largest companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Delrahim’s Preview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 11, 2019, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-antitrust-new-frontiers&quot;&gt;a speech to the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference in Israel&lt;/a&gt; that laid out the conceptual framework within which this lawsuit fits (Delrahim &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/technology/makan-delrahim-antitrust-google-tech.html&quot;&gt;recused himself&lt;/a&gt; from this case specifically as he previously worked on Google’s DoubleClick acquisition). The most interesting part of the speech was focused on the history of antitrust, starting with Standard Oil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Oil acquired many refineries in the late 19th century. Refiners that would not sell were underpriced and driven out of the market. Price-cutting is the essence of competition, of course, but the Standard Oil case and later Supreme Court cases helped establish what would become settled law: there are some things that a monopolist cannot do. A company does not ordinarily violate the antitrust laws for merely exercising legitimately gained market power. But even if a company achieves monopoly position through legitimate means, it cannot take actions that do not advance plausible business goals but rather are designed to make it harder for competitors to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the speech Delrahim specifically called out exclusivity agreements as an example of this illegal behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exclusivity is another important category of potentially anticompetitive conduct. The Antitrust Division has had a long history of analyzing exclusive conduct in traditional industries under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Generally speaking, an exclusivity agreement is an agreement in which a firm requires its customers to buy exclusively from it, or its suppliers to sell exclusively to it. There are variations of this restraint, such as requirements contracts or volume discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, in some circumstances, these can be procompetitive, especially where they enable OEMs and retailers to maximize output and overcome free-riding by contractual partners. In digital markets, they can be beneficial to new entrants, particularly in markets characterized by network effects and a dominant incumbent. They also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition. This is true in digital markets as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/delrahims-speech-on-tech-and-antitrust-tech-and-antitrust-updated-youtube-and-instagrams-scale-defense/&quot;&gt;I noted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, this speech was clearly a very big deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping back, the first and most important takeaway from this speech is that this focus on tech companies does not feel like a top-down directive from President Trump to focus on political enemies (like the AT&amp;amp;T case did). This is a substantive and far-reaching overview of why tech is worthy of being investigated, and my estimate as to whether an antitrust case will happen has increased considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was filed yesterday: contrary to the complaints of many Google critics and competitors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/ends-means-and-antitrust/&quot;&gt;the European Union in the Google Shopping case&lt;/a&gt;, it is not focused on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERP), and, contrary to the (still ongoing) investigation from 50 state and territory attorneys general, it is not focused on Google’s ad business. The focus is narrow, and inline with Delrahim’s framework: Google may have earned its position honestly, but it is maintaining it illegally, in large part by paying off distributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The DOJ’s Case, and Google’s Response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the DOJ’s argument is at the beginning of the complaint; this excerpt is a bit long, but that is because these five paragraphs contain basically the entire case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a general search engine, by far the most effective means of distribution is to be the preset default general search engine for mobile and computer search access points. Even where users can change the default, they rarely do. This leaves the preset default general search engine with de facto exclusivity. As Google itself has recognized, this is particularly true on mobile devices, where defaults are especially sticky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Google has entered into exclusionary agreements, including tying arrangements, and engaged in anticompetitive conduct to lock up distribution channels and block rivals. Google pays billions of dollars each year to distributors — including popular-device manufacturers such as Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb — to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors. Some of these agreements also require distributors to take a bundle of Google apps, including its search apps, and feature them on devices in prime positions where consumers are most likely to start their internet searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has thus foreclosed competition for internet search. General search engine competitors are denied vital distribution, scale, and product recognition—ensuring they have no real chance to challenge Google. Google is so dominant that “Google” is not only a noun to identify the company and the Google search engine but also a verb that means to search the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google monetizes this search monopoly in the markets for search advertising and general search text advertising, both of which Google has also monopolized for many years. Google uses consumer search queries and consumer information to sell advertising. In the United States, advertisers pay about $40 billion annually to place ads on Google’s search engine results page (SERP). It is these search advertising monopoly revenues that Google “shares” with distributors in return for commitments to favor Google’s search engine. These enormous payments create a strong disincentive for distributors to switch. The payments also raise barriers to entry for rivals—particularly for small, innovative search companies that cannot afford to pay a multi-billion-dollar entry fee. Through these exclusionary payoffs, and the other anticompetitive conduct described below, Google has created continuous and self-reinforcing monopolies in multiple markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s anticompetitive practices are especially pernicious because they deny rivals scale to compete effectively. General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising require complex algorithms that are constantly learning which organic results and ads best respond to user queries; the volume, variety, and velocity of data accelerates the automated learning of search and search advertising algorithms. When asked to name Google’s biggest strength in search, Google’s former CEO explained: “Scale is the key. We just have so much scale in terms of the data we can bring to bear.” By using distribution agreements to lock up scale for itself and deny it to others, Google unlawfully maintains its monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google argues that this is “deeply flawed”; from the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department’s complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make Google Search easily available to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, like countless other businesses, we pay to promote our services, just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at the end of a row or on a shelf at eye level. For digital services, when you first buy a device, it has a kind of home screen “eye level shelf.” On mobile, that shelf is controlled by Apple, as well as companies like AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Samsung and LG. On desktop computers, that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we negotiate agreements with many of those companies for eye-level shelf space. But let’s be clear—our competitors are readily available too, if you want to use them…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger point is that people don’t use Google because they have to, they use it because they choose to. This isn’t the dial-up 1990s, when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM. Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds—faster than you can walk to another aisle in the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as Google founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2012/04/05/larry-page-posts-update-from-the-ceo-2012%E2%80%B3-memo-detailing-googles-aspirations/&quot;&gt;Larry Page was fond of saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Competition is only a click away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the vast majority of antitrust complaints about big tech generally, and online services specifically, is that Page is right. You may only have one choice of cable company or phone service or any number of physical goods and real-world services, but on the Internet everything is just zero marginal bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, means there is an abundance of data, and Google helps consumers manage that abundance better than anyone. This, in turn, leads Google’s suppliers to work to make Google better — what is SEO but a collective effort by basically the entire Internet to ensure that Google’s search engine is as good as possible? — which attracts more consumers, which drives suppliers to work even harder in a virtuous cycle. Meanwhile, Google is collecting information from all of those consumers, particularly what results they click on for which searches, to continuously hone its accuracy and relevance, making the product that much better, attracting that many more end users, in another virtuous cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1-1024x334.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google benefits from two virtuous cycles&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5349&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1-1024x334.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1-300x98.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1-768x250.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1-1200x391.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/us-google-1.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the central ongoing projects of this site has been to argue that this phenomenon, which I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;, is endemic to digital markets. From the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory Article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users. The best way to make outsize profits in any of these markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution. In the pre-Internet era the latter depended on controlling distribution…Note how the distributors in all of these industries integrated backwards into supply: there have always been far more users/consumers than suppliers, which means that in a world where transactions are costly owning the supplier relationship provides significantly more leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its head. First, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-1024x440.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3339&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-1024x440.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-300x129.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-768x330.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-1200x515.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png 1816w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, increased digitization leads to increased centralization (the opposite of what many originally assumed about the Internet). It also provides a lot of consumer benefit — again, Aggregators win by building ever better products for consumers — which is why Aggregators are broadly popular in a way that traditional monopolists are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, too many antitrust-focused critiques of tech have missed this essential difference. I wrote about this mistake in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/&quot;&gt;Where Warren’s Wrong&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is best for Senator Warren’s argument that her article never does explain how these companies became so big, because the reason cuts at the core of her argument: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple dominate because consumers like them. Each of them leveraged technology to solve unique user needs, acquired users, then leveraged those users to attract suppliers onto their platforms &lt;em&gt;by choice&lt;/em&gt;, which attracted more users, creating a virtuous cycle that I have christened &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation Theory is the reason why all of these companies have escaped antitrust scrutiny to date in the U.S.: here antitrust law rests on the consumer welfare standard, and the entire reason why these companies succeed is because they deliver consumer benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union does have a different standard, rooted in a drive to preserve competition; given that the virtuous cycle described by Aggregation Theory does tend towards winner-take-all effects, it is not a surprise that Google in particular has faced multiple antitrust actions from the European Commission. Even the EU standard, though, struggles with the real consumer benefits delivered by Aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the Google Shopping case: Google was found guilty of antitrust violations in a case brought by a shopping comparison site called Foundem, which complained about their site being buried when consumers were searching for items to buy. This complaint made no sense, as I explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/ends-means-and-antitrust/&quot;&gt;Ends, Means, and Antitrust&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I search for a specific product, why would I not want to be shown that specific product? It frankly seems bizarre to argue that I would prefer to see links to shopping comparison sites; if that is what I wanted I would search for “Shopping Comparison Sites”, a request that Google is more than happy to fulfill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/ends-means-and-antitrust/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-6.40.22-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2017-06-28 at 6.40.22 PM&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;702&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2644&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-6.40.22-PM.png 795w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-6.40.22-PM-300x265.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-6.40.22-PM-768x678.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-6.40.22-PM-713x630.png 713w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission is effectively arguing that Google is wrong by virtue of fulfilling my search request explicitly; apparently they should read my mind and serve up an answer (a shopping comparison site) that is in fact different from what I am requesting (a product)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly an argument to be made that Google, not only in Shopping but also in verticals like local search, is choking off the websites on which Search relies by increasingly offering its own results. At the same time, there is absolutely nothing stopping customers from visiting those websites directly, or downloading their apps, bypassing Google completely. That consumers choose not to is not because Google is somehow restricting them — that is impossible! — but because they don’t want to. Is it really the purview of regulators to correct consumer choices willingly made?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is that answer “no” for philosophical reasons, it should be “no” for pragmatic reasons, as the ongoing Google Shopping saga in Europe demonstrates. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/regulating-demand-ad-targeting-and-unintended-consequences-expedia-ceo-out/&quot;&gt;I noted last December&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission keeps changing its mind about remedies in that case, not because Google is being impertinent, but because seeking to undo an Aggregator by changing consumer preferences is like pushing on a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Regulating Aggregators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, to be clear, is not simply throwing one’s hands up in the air and despairing that nothing can be done. It is nearly impossible to break up an Aggregator’s virtuous cycle once it is spinning, both because there isn’t a good legal case to do so (again, consumers are benefitting!), and because the cycle itself is so strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What regulators can do, though, is prevent Aggregators from artificially enhancing their natural advantages. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/&quot;&gt;A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregators are different. Yes, they provide value to end users and to third-parties, at least for a time, but the incentives are warped from the beginning: 3rd-parties are not actually incentivized to serve users well, but rather to make the Aggregator happy. The implication from a societal perspective is that the economic impact of an Aggregator is much more self-contained than a platform, which means there is correspondingly less of a concern about limiting Aggregator growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Aggregator power comes from controlling demand, regulators should look at the acquisition of other potential Aggregators with extreme skepticism. At the same time, whatever an Aggregator chooses to do on its own site or app is less important, because users and third parties can always go elsewhere, and if they don’t, that is because they are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Facebook is a useful example: the company’s competitive position would be considerably shakier — and the consumer ad-supported ecosystem considerably healthier — if it had not acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, two other consumer-facing apps. At the same time, Facebook’s specific policies around what does or does not appear on its apps, or how it organizes its feed, has no reason to be a regulatory concern; I would argue the same thing when it comes to Google’s search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same principle applies to contracts; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/&quot;&gt;Where Warren’s Wrong&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregators already have massive structural advantages in their value chains; to that end, there should be significantly more attention paid to market restrictions that are enforced by contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to Microsoft: in my estimation the most egregious antitrust violations committed by Microsoft were the restrictions placed on OEMs, both to ensure the installation of Internet Explorer as well as to suppress alternative operating systems. These were not violations rooted in market dominance, at least not directly, but rather contracts that OEMs could not afford to say ‘No’ to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area where &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-commission-versus-android/&quot;&gt;the European Commission has gotten it right&lt;/a&gt; with regard to Google: as a condition of access to Google apps, most critically the Play Store, OEMs were prohibited from selling any phones with Android forks. This is a restriction on competition produced not by market dominance, at least not directly, but rather contracts that OEMs could not afford to say ‘No’ to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the issue with Apple’s App Store: the restriction on linking to a website for purchasing an ebook or subscribing to a streaming service is not rooted in any sort of technical limitation; rather, it is an arbitrary rule in the App Developer Agreement enforced by Apple’s App Review team. It has nothing to do with consumer security, and everything to do with Apple’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area ripe for enhanced antitrust enforcement: these large tech companies have enough advantages, most of them earned through delivering what customers want, and abetted by the fundamental nature of zero marginal costs. Seeking to augment those advantages through contracts that suppliers can’t say ‘No’ to should be viewed with extreme skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why I am so pleased to see how narrowly focused the Justice Department’s lawsuit it: instead of trying to argue that Google should not make search results better, the Justice Department is arguing that Google, given its inherent advantages as a monopoly, should have to win on the merits of its product, not the inevitably larger size of its revenue share agreements. In other words, Google can enjoy the natural fruits of being an Aggregator, it just can’t use artificial means — in this case contracts — to extend that inherent advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google’s Defense&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the fact that the Justice Department is focused on the correct issue with Google Search does not mean this lawsuit will be successful. Google’s defense is fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Google will argue that its deals do not represent lock-in; users can change the default search option for the vast majority of touch points that Google pays for, and the fact they choose not to is because Google’s search is better. This last point is why the Justice Department took pains to emphasize the importance of data in improving search engine performance, because to the extent that is true, it means it is impossible for alternative search engines to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Google will argue that its deals on non-Google platforms (i.e. Apple platforms and rival browsers) were because Google was willing to pay more than the competition, which is not only the open market at work, but also means that the associated products can be offered at a lower price or even for free. Here again the Justice Department is relying on a scale argument: Google’s monopoly in search means it has a monopoly in search advertising, which means it can afford to outbid all of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, Google will argue that its deals for Android distribution and the tying of search defaults to Google Play Services (including the Play Store) is not only pro-consumer in its benefits, including free services, less fragmentation, and a larger market for apps, but is also Google’s just reward for having invested in the creation of Android. This last argument didn’t work in front of the European Commission, but it may be more effective before a U.S. judge. The Justice Department, meanwhile, probably has the strongest case on this point: sure, Google created Android, but it also made the choice to open source it, and if its attempts to re-seize control through blatant tying aren’t illegal then it’s hard to imagine what could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Google and Apple&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, though, one more complicating factor: the weird dynamics of Google’s relationship with Apple. From the lawsuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has had a series of search distribution agreements with Apple, effectively locking up one of the most significant distribution channels for general search engines. Apple operates a tightly controlled ecosystem and produces both the hardware and the operating system for its popular products. Apple does not license its operating systems to third- party manufacturers and controls preinstallation of all apps on its products. The Safari browser is the preinstalled default browser on Apple computer and mobile devices. Apple devices account for roughly 60 percent of mobile device usage in the United States. Apple’s Mac OS accounts for approximately 25 percent of the computer usage in the United States…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has not developed and does not offer its own general search engine. Under the current agreement between Apple and Google, which has a multi-year term, Apple must make Google’s search engine the default for Safari, and use Google for Siri and Spotlight in response to general search queries. In exchange for this privileged access to Apple’s massive consumer base, Google pays Apple billions of dollars in advertising revenue each year, with public estimates ranging around $8–12 billion. The revenues Google shares with Apple make up approximately 15–20 percent of Apple’s worldwide net income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to change the search default on Safari from Google to a competing general search engine, few people do, making Google the de facto exclusive general search engine. That is why Google pays Apple billions on a yearly basis for default status. Indeed, Google’s documents recognize that “Safari default is a significant revenue channel” and that losing the deal would fundamentally harm Google’s bottom line. Thus, Google views the prospect of losing default status on Apple devices as a “Code Red” scenario. In short, Google pays Apple billions to be the default search provider, in part, because Google knows the agreement increases the company’s valuable scale; this simultaneously denies that scale to rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is fascinating about this relationship is the number of ways in which this can be interpreted. From one perspective, the fact that Google has to pay so much to Apple is evidence that there is competition in the market. From another perspective, the fact that Apple can extract so much money from Google is evidence that it is Apple that has monopoly-like power over its value chain. A third perspective — surely the one endorsed by the Justice Department — is that the fact that Google values the default position so highly is &lt;em&gt;ipso facto&lt;/em&gt; evidence that default position matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the true answer is a mixture of all three, with a dash of collusion. The lawsuit notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s RSA incentivizes Apple to push more and more search traffic to Google and accommodate Google’s strategy of denying scale to rivals. For example, in 2018, Apple’s and Google’s CEOs met to discuss how the companies could work together to drive search revenue growth. After the 2018 meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets at a larger problem in many tech markets: the tendency towards duopoly, which often lets one company cover for the other acting anti-competitively. In the case of Apple and Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Android’s presence in the market means that Apple can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;act anticompetitively&lt;/a&gt; with its App Store policies (which Google is happy to ape).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple’s privacy focus justifies decisions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/privacy-fundamentalism/&quot;&gt;limiting trackers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/&quot;&gt;restricting cookies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/&quot;&gt;cutting off in-app analytics&lt;/a&gt;; Google happily follows Apple’s lead, which impacts its advertising rivals far more than it does Google, improving their relative competitive position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple earns billions of dollars giving its customers the best default search experience, even as that ensures that Google will remain the best search engine (and raises questions about the sincerity of Apple’s privacy rhetoric).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only duopoly: Google and Facebook jointly dominate digital advertising, Microsoft and Google jointly dominate productivity applications, Microsoft and Amazon jointly dominate the public cloud, and Amazon and Google jointly dominate shopping searches. And, while all of these companies compete, those competitive forces have set nearly all of these duopolies into fairly stable positions that justify cooperation of the sort documented between Apple and Google, even as any one company alone is able to use its rival as justification for avoiding antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Anti-Aggregation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the House Antitrust Committee released its report on the tech industry I wrote that it was important to distinguish between &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/anti-monopoly-vs-antitrust/&quot;&gt;Anti-monopoly and Antitrust&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is why it is a mistake to read the report as some sort of technocratic document. There are, to be sure, a lot of interesting facts that were dug up by the committee, and some bad behavior, which may or may not be anticompetitive in the legal sense. Certainly the companies would prefer to have a legalistic antitrust debate, for good reason: it is exceptionally difficult to make the case that any of these companies are causing consumer harm, which is the de facto standard for antitrust in the United States. Indeed, what makes Google’s contention that “The competition is only a click away” so infuriating is the fact it is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters more is the context laid out by Letwin: there is a strain of political thought in America, independent of political party (although traditionally associated with Democrats), that is inherently allergic to concentrated power — monopoly in the populist sense, if not the legal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state; later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts; but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this subcommittee report is simply a new expression of an old idea; the details matter less than the fact it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a critical sentiment to keep in mind as this case unfolds. If I had to bet on an outcome, I would bet on Google winning. Apple and everyone else are free to enter into whatever contracts they wish, and consumers are free to undo the defaults that flow from those contracts. Where is the harm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, of course, wants the conversation to stop there: as long as the argument is a legal one, or even an economic one, Aggregators have powerful justifications for their dominance. That, though, is why the real question is a political one: are we as a society comfortable with a few big companies having such an outsized role in our lives? If the answer is no, the ultimate answer will not be through the courts, but through new laws for a new era. Anti-aggregation, not antitrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc joined the cryptocurrency market on Wednesday, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other virtual coins using the U.S. digital payments company’s online wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;PayPal hopes the service will encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by central banks and corporations, President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“We are working with central banks and thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said. It plans to expand to Venmo and some countries in the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Other mainstream fintech companies, such as mobile payments provider Square Inc and stock trading app firm Robinhood Markets Inc, allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but PayPal’s launch is noteworthy given its vast reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The company, based in San Jose, California, has 346 million active accounts around the world and processed $222 billion in payments in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrencies tend to be volatile, making them attractive to speculators, but a lot less appealing to merchants and shoppers. Transactions have been slower and more costly than other mainstream payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency payments on PayPal will be settled using fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, meaning merchants will not receive payments in virtual coins, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Many central banks around the world have expressed their intention to develop digital versions of their currencies in the coming years, while Facebook Inc-led the creation of a cryptocurrency project called Libra in 2019. PayPal was a founding member but dropped out after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;PayPal, which has secured the first conditional cryptocurrency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, will initially allow purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies called ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, it said. It partners with Paxos Trust Company to offer the service. (Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hands-Free Coding: How I develop software using dictation and eye-tracking</title>
<link>https://joshwcomeau.com/accessibility/hands-free-coding/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://joshwcomeau.com/accessibility/hands-free-coding/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, I developed Cubital Tunnel Syndrome, a repetitive-strain injury, in both of my elbows. As a result, I pretty much can't use a mouse or keyboard; after a few minutes, I get a burning pain shooting down my arms. Even if I try to limit my computer usage to 60-second bursts, I wind up inadvertently making the situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;As you might imagine, this was a pretty big deal; as a software developer, my entire career is based on being able to use a keyboard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;After many failed attempts at solving the problem with physiotherapy, ergonomics, braces, diet and supplements, prescription medications, supplements, and a bunch of other stuff, I've found a solution that allows me to be productive without risking further nerve damage. I now work almost exclusively using a microphone and an eye-tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;In this article, I'll show you what that workflow looks like, and how I've optimized it to fit my needs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;Heading__MajorHeading-fi8r6p-4 hiInQI&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;To give you a quick sense of what this looks like, here's a short video of me writing a React component:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;We'll get into how this all works, don't worry if it doesn't make a ton of sense yet! I mostly wanted to showcase this upfront to show how &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; this process can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Dictation software has been around for a long time, but it's usually used purely to transcribe speech, often in the legal and medical industries. Writing code is a different beast, since there's a lot of syntax and conventions and non-dictionary words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Fortunately, specialized software exists! I currently use &lt;a href=&quot;https://talonvoice.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Talon Voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Talon Voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tool built specifically to help software developers work without using their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Talon has a free public version, but the exciting stuff happens in the paid private beta. You can gain access by supporting the creator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;on Patreon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;on Patreon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Let's dive into how this software works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;&gt;Link to this headingAlphabet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The first thing you learn as a new Talon user is how to dictate individual letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Generally, you won't be dictating one letter at a time, but it comes in handy now and then, like specifying CSS units (px, rem, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;English is an annoying language when it comes to phonetics. So many of our letters sound the same. There's a reason telephone operators say things like &quot;M like Mary&quot;, &quot;T as in Thomas&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The United Nations solved this problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;NATO phonetic alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;NATO phonetic alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—you know, the Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot thing. But these words tend to be multi-syllable, and nobody has time for that jazz. So Talon includes its own phonetic mappings of (mostly) single-syllable words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;List__UnorderedListElem-ox71bz-1 iwiPcQ&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;List__Wrapper-ox71bz-3 dQYnDv&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; - air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;List__Wrapper-ox71bz-3 dQYnDv&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; - bat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;List__Wrapper-ox71bz-3 dQYnDv&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; - cap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;List__Wrapper-ox71bz-3 dQYnDv&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; - drum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;When I say “drum” into the microphone, the letter &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is written as if I had pressed that key on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;You can capitalize letters by prefixing them with “ship”. “ship drum” will output &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Numbers are spoken normally, from 0 through 9. If I wanted to output &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;1024&lt;/code&gt;, I would speak “one zero two four”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;&gt;Link to this headingHotkeys and ordinals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Talon has intuitive mappings for most special characters. &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;command cap&lt;/code&gt;, for example, will hold &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; while pressing the &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; key, to copy to the clipboard. &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;control command space&lt;/code&gt; will open the Emoji drawer on MacOS, since that's the OS-level mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Certain keys are mapped to shorter/cuter terms. Instead of &quot;backspace&quot;, I say &quot;junk&quot;. &quot;Delete&quot; becomes &quot;dell&quot;. If you're unhappy with any of the mappings, by the way, everything is editable in Talon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Arrow keys are prefixed with the word &quot;go&quot;. If I want to move the cursor left, I say &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;go left&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;This would be really tedious if not for one awesome addition: &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;ordinals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;In English, an ordinal number is one used to describe order, like &quot;fifth&quot; or &quot;ninth&quot; or &quot;three hundredth&quot;. In Talon, they're used to repeat commands. If I wanted to go left by 9 spaces, I would say &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;go left ninth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The phrasing is a little strange. Surely, &quot;go left nine&quot; would be more intuitive, right? But &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;nine&lt;/code&gt; is already taken; it outputs the literal number &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This works for all commands.&lt;/strong&gt; If I wanted to write the number &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;, I would say &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;one zero third&lt;/code&gt;, to repeat the &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; character 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;&gt;Link to this headingFormatters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The conventional way to write Javascript uses camelCase for variables. In fact, there are lots of conventions when it comes to variable names! Talon has a solution for this: &lt;strong&gt;formatters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;A formatter is a command which will transform the text spoken afterwards. When I say “camel hello world”, for example, the software outputs &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;helloWorld&lt;/code&gt;. Conversely, “snake hello world” produces &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;hello_world&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;If you want to output text without transforming it, the command is &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;say&lt;/code&gt;. “say hello world” will output &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Formatters can be composed. For example, I'm a fan of UPPER_SNAKE for Javascript constants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;To output &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;DARK_COLORS&lt;/code&gt;, I can combine the &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;snake&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;allcaps&lt;/code&gt; formatters. “allcaps snake dark colors” outputs &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;DARK_COLORS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Heading__NormalHeading-fi8r6p-5 MHJjN&quot;&gt;Link to this headingCommand mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;While Talon does have a &quot;dictation mode&quot;, the default mode is command-based. Commands can be thought of as functions. Everything we've seen so far is command-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;For example, when I say &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;focus chrome&lt;/code&gt;, it's like I'm calling the &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; function, and passing &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;chrome&lt;/code&gt; as an argument. &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; is a command that focuses the specified application, so this would be equivalent to using Spotlight to select Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; isn't some black-box native thing built into Talon, though; it's part of a community package of commands. I can access and edit the source, which is written in Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The real power of Talon is being able to &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;create your own commands&lt;/em&gt;. It offers a bunch of APIs for interacting with the operating system and outputting characters. I've created a dozen handy utilities for front-end development, and I expect I'll add many more as I keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;You can add simple &quot;say X to produce Y&quot; commands using a YAML-like syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;When I speak &quot;react&quot;, the software outputs &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;import React from 'react';&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;For more complex commands, you can write Python functions. As an example, here's what happens when I say “styled button fancy button”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The second word, &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;button&lt;/code&gt;, is matched against a known set of HTML elements. The subsequent words, &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;fancy button&lt;/code&gt;, are UpperCamelCased and used for the component name. It adds some whitespace, and moves the cursor to the appropriate spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Here's the Python source for the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;And here's the Talon mapping:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Programming Talon commands is beyond the scope of this article. If you're interested, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://talon.wiki/unofficial_talon_docs/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;unofficial Talon docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;unofficial Talon docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can also learn a ton by reading how existing commands are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;You can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talon-commands&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;my fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;my fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the commands, which includes all the React stuff I've added—be warned, though, it's messy, incomplete, and poorly documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;No matter how good speech recognition gets, there will always be ambiguities that will be difficult to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;For example, if I say &quot;check out my site&quot;, do I mean &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;sight&lt;/code&gt;? Or possibly &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;cite&lt;/code&gt;??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;To resolve these ambiguities, Talon includes a &lt;code class=&quot;InlineCode-sc-187729h-0 kWtAqN&quot;&gt;phones&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I learned about this trick from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yomilly&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Emily Shea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Emily Shea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s amazing conference talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz3JeYfBTcY&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Perl Out Loud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Perl Out Loud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong class=&quot;Sidenote__Title-rbeavg-4 bBebJQ&quot;&gt;Menu UI!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;In order to select the correct homophone, Talon pops open a little menu. Because everything in Talon is made available through APIs, I imagine we can use the same UI for other things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I'm excited to experiment more with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ContentHeading__Wrapper-sc-11npftn-0 iNEKxj&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;By far the most sci-fi part of my setup is my eye-tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;tobii 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;tobii 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's a bar with an infrared sensor, and it tracks your eye motion. It slaps onto the front of your monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;&lt;span type=&quot;default&quot; class=&quot;PostImage__Wrapper-xip32o-0 eTpvwr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://joshwcomeau.com/images/hands-free-coding/eye-tracker.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;imac computer with a slim bar stuck on the front&quot; class=&quot;PostImage__Image-xip32o-2 eyiMVf&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Interestingly, it isn't marketed as a mouse replacement; it's designed for Windows users for some sort of competitive gaming purpose. But Talon—the same software I use for dictation—includes custom MacOS drivers that allow it to function as a mouse replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Clicking is a two step process. First, you look where you want to click, and make a popping noise with your mouth. This will zoom way in, and allow you to be really precise with your click. A second pop will perform a left-click:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;There are commands to double-click, to right-click, and to drag and release. It takes some getting used to, but it works surprisingly well. The accuracy is good enough to do some pretty precise things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The tobii 5 sells for $229 USD. You can also try and find the tobii 4C, which is purported to offer a smoother experience with Talon, but they're really rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;So far, I've shared only the tip of the iceberg of what I've learned, and what I've learned is only the tip of an even-bigger iceberg—Talon is a really powerful tool, and I'm still figuring it out. It took &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; to become proficient with a keyboard, so I'm still very early into my journey with dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;In fact, I'd say that this whole cottage industry is pretty new. Talon is a wonderful piece of technology, and it's already had a huge positive impact in my life, but I think there's so much potential and opportunity ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Talon continues to improve every day—it uses a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to handle speech-recognition, and I've already seen a noticeable improvement with it. Other products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://serenade.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Serenade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Serenade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seem pretty compelling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuralink.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are working on establishing a &quot;direct link&quot; between our brains and everyday technology. It sounds like science fiction, but I may soon be able to &quot;think&quot; my code into existence ✨😮✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I'd say I probably work at about 50% of my normal speed&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;UnstyledButton-sc-1qlpyz4-0 Asterisk__TouchArea-sc-7mknzy-3 kpvqgA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__AsteriskGlyph-sc-7mknzy-2 kRONNh&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Now, this doesn't mean that I produce 50% of the results; it just means I need to prioritize a little more ruthlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I've heard that learning Vim can make this much more effective. Depending on how much longer my injury lasts, I may consider switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The biggest issue I've found so far is voice strain; I'm not used to talking for 8+ hours a day! I imagine I need to build a tolerance, and I hope to get better at this with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The first few weeks were rough. In addition to it being slow and frustrating, Talon work best when you write your own commands. I'd wind up hurting myself trying to get it set up. Being able to configure Talon by voice is a real milestone, and it's gone much smoother since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Honestly, it's just been such a relief to discover that my hands aren't needed for me to do my work. Recently, I heard Kent C Dodds and Joel Hooks talking on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://egghead.io/podcasts/kent-c-dodds-chats-about-how-epic-react-was-designed-for-learner-success&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;egghead podcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;egghead podcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Kent's wary of injuring his hands, since as a software developer and educator, they're his money-makers&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;UnstyledButton-sc-1qlpyz4-0 Asterisk__TouchArea-sc-7mknzy-3 kpvqgA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__AsteriskGlyph-sc-7mknzy-2 kRONNh&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. I used to feel the same way, whereas now I see that with a bit of determination and a lot of awesome technology, nothing's gonna stand in my way 💖&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;There's something else I want to talk about, and it's a bit less fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;Here's the thing: you are not likely to develop Cubital Tunnel Syndrome. Even if you do, it'll likely go away on its own after a few weeks; many cases resolve spontaneously, and most respond well to conservative treatments. I'm an edge-case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;At some point in your life, however, you will likely experience some sort of impairment, whether temporary or permanent. Almost all of us will&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;UnstyledButton-sc-1qlpyz4-0 Asterisk__TouchArea-sc-7mknzy-3 kpvqgA&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__Wrapper-sc-7mknzy-1 lnnXwr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Asterisk__AsteriskGlyph-sc-7mknzy-2 kRONNh&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;It's so so easy to fall into the trap of thinking about accessibility as something that affects &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt;, a hypothetical abstract group. I've known that accessibility is important for years, but it felt kinda nebulous to me; I've never watched someone struggle to use a thing I built because I neglected to test it without a mouse or keyboard. It feels more urgent to me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I am still incredibly privileged, and I don't mean to compare my situation to anybody else's. But this experience has given me a window into what it's like trying to operate on an internet not designed with alternative input mechanisms in mind. Before I got comfortable with the eye-tracker, things were &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;tricky&lt;/em&gt;. And certain things are much more difficult than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;The internet has become critical infrastructure. It's a necessary part of living in modern society, and it needs to be accessible! As front-end developers, it's our job to advocate for it, and to ensure that we build with accessibility principles in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;If you'd like to learn more about accessibility, I recommend checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://a11y.coffee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;a11y.coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;a11y.coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I've learned one other thing from this experience: I should prioritize stuff which is important to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;One of the very first web apps I built was an education platform. This was about a decade ago, and it was built with PHP, MySQL, and jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I gave up on that product when I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was essentially what I was doing, but way better. I would later go on to work as a software engineer at Khan Academy, and do some of the most fulfilling work of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I've long since imagined that at some point, I'd start my own thing in education. Even though I've been motivated to do this for years, I kept putting it off. This experience has taught me something valuable: I don't have an infinite amount of time ahead of me. If there's something I want to do, I should do it now, since I may not be able to do it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;A few weeks ago, I left my job as a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Gatsby Inc, and I've been quietly working on a New Thing. I'm &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; ready to announce it. All I'll say for now: if you enjoyed my recent blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 Link__InternalLink-sc-68e6gi-1 jammUC TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;full-bleed layouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;full-bleed layouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you'll &lt;em class=&quot;Em-sc-1jc74i7-0 kDfTEl&quot;&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; what I'm working on 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I'd like to thank two friends and former coworkers who suggested the idea of dictation to me: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amber1ey&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Amberley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Amberley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/madalynrose&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;Link__ExternalLink-sc-68e6gi-0 fRBNyP TextLink__Wrapper-omifi9-0 wcPOv&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextLink__MainText-omifi9-1 cnmPCj&quot;&gt;Madalyn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;TextLink__HoverText-omifi9-2 cQJOJi&quot;&gt;Madalyn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure the idea ever would have occurred to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-d2u36h-0 btOwpF&quot;&gt;I was also inspired by two conference talks on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot;&gt;Case studies have revealed neurological problems in severely affected COVID-19 patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of severity. We analysed cognitive test data from 84,285 Great British Intelligence Test participants who completed a questionnaire regarding suspected and biologically confirmed COVID-19 infection. People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders. They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty. Finer grained analyses of performance support the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-system impact on human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Competing Interest Statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot;&gt;The authors have declared no competing interest.&lt;/p&gt;
