<title>iPhone workers given choice of forced labor or being sent to detention centers</title>
<link>https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/29/iphone-workers-forced-labor/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/29/iphone-workers-forced-labor/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A fresh claim of &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; workers being used as forced labor in &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has appeared today, following an investigation by the Tech Transparency Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It suggests that iPhone glass supplier Lens Technology has been using Muslim minority Uighurs, who were given the stark choice of working in the company’s plant or being sent to detention centers which have been likened to concentration camps …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-687912&quot;/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle author_ad&quot; data-ad-host=&quot;ca-host-pub-5506057612223327&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-2445248216782983&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/lens-technology-apple-uighur/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; carries the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest and most well-known iPhone suppliers has been accused of using forced Muslim labor in its factories, according to documents uncovered by a human rights group, adding new scrutiny to Apple’s human rights record in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents, discovered by the Tech Transparency Project and shared exclusively with The Washington Post, detail how thousands of Uighur workers from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang were sent to work for Lens Technology […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lens Technology is one of at least five companies connected to Apple’s supply chain that have now been linked to alleged forced labor from the Xinjiang region, according to human rights groups. Lens Technology stands out from other Apple component suppliers because of its high-profile founder and long, well-documented history going back to the early days of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous reports, the company is located in Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is said to have placed more than a million Uighurs into detention centers, or forced them to work for companies in prison-like conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government claims that all the Uighur workers are there by choice, but a US academic says that is misleading at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s really no way to give informed consent in Xinjiang any longer because the threat of extrajudicial detention is so extreme,” said Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies Uighur migrants […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Chinese government does not permit human rights groups to enter the country to interview laborers or observe conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; denies the claims, stating that it has specific checks in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said the company has confirmed that Lens Technology has not received any labor transfers of Uighur workers from Xinjiang. He said Apple earlier this year ensured that none of its other suppliers are using Uighur labor transferred from Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor,” Rosenstock said. “Looking for the presence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment we conduct, including surprise audits. These protections apply across the supply chain, regardless of a person’s job or location. Any violation of our policies has immediate consequences, including possible business termination. As always, our focus is on making sure everyone is treated with dignity and respect, and we will continue doing all we can to protect workers in our supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple took action against iPhone camera supplier O-Film over similar forced labor claims, though that report stated that the Cupertino company has &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/03/iphone-camera-supplier-o-film/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;not yet entirely removed the company&lt;/a&gt; from its supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous forced labor report &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/02/apple-suppliers-implicated-in-reports-of-uyghur-forced-labor-in-china/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;implicated LCD screen maker BOE&lt;/a&gt;, and a garment company which was said to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/10/apple-store-staff-t-shirts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;made Apple Store staff t-shirts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many now believe it is impossible to use any suppliers based in Xinjiang without running a strong risk of being complicit in the use of forced labor.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ten year study: No link between violent video games and aggressive behavior</title>
<link>https://gamesage.net/blogs/news/ten-year-long-study-confirms-no-link-between-playing-violent-video-games-as-early-as-ten-years-old-and-aggressive-behavior-later-in-life</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gamesage.net/blogs/news/ten-year-long-study-confirms-no-link-between-playing-violent-video-games-as-early-as-ten-years-old-and-aggressive-behavior-later-in-life</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Longitudinal Study into Violent Video Games&quot; href=&quot;https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2020.0049&quot;&gt;ten-year longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in the Journal of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking&lt;/em&gt; on a group in early adolescence from as young as ten years old, investigated how playing violent video games at an early age would translate into adulthood behavior (23 years of age). Titled &quot;Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents&quot; the study found no correlation between growing up playing video games and increased levels of aggression ten years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study utilized a more contemporary approach for analyzing its data, known as the person-centered approach. Traditional studies use a variable-centered approach whereby researchers treat each variable, or characteristic, as related to another variable. An example would be that exercising is related to a reduced incidence of heart disease. This has been particularly valuable when comparing groups. In a person-centered approach researchers combine various algorithms across variables to determine how these variables compare among individuals. This approach provides a more accurate depiction of how variables relate to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, this study “accounts for heterogeneity, grouping individuals who are similar and who share a set of characteristics that vary similarly over time.” Participant families were recruited through “a large north-western city” beginning in 2007 (Wave 1) via telephone directories and required to complete questionnaires. 65% were Caucasian, 12% black and 19% multi-ethnic, 4% other. Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add to and diversify the sample group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video game violence ratings were assessed through the Common Sense Media, known to be a viable rating body for media. Participants were assessed through various behavioral characteristics such as aggression, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that boys played more violent video games than girls. Groups displayed three forms of video game play, according to the study: high-initial violence (4%) which indicated individuals played a high-level of violent video games at an early age, moderate initial violence (23%) whereby violent video game play was moderate at an early age, and low initial violence (73%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that group with low initial violence “was no higher in aggressive behavior than the high initial violence group at the final time point.” Therefore, it is determined that adolescents who played a high-level of violent video games at an early age did not show more aggressive behavior later in life than those who played fewer to no hours of violent video games at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Maps&amp;#039; Moat Is Evaporating</title>
<link>https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/google-maps-moat-is-evaporating</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/google-maps-moat-is-evaporating</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The views expressed in this newsletter are solely my own, and do not represent the views of my employer. Well, they aren’t solely my own, because I’ve stolen most of them from people smarter than me. But, you get what I’m saying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work at the intersection of maps and software, at some point in your life you’ve probably heard yourself muttering some version of the following analogy to a stubbornly confused family member:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Google Maps? What I do is, like, build little pieces of Google Maps over and over for people who need them but can’t just use Google Maps because they’re not allowed to for some reason, or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you never quite put it &lt;em&gt;that way,&lt;/em&gt; because it would hurt too much to admit it to yourself so plainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have half-heartedly compared their profession to Google Maps at family gatherings for well over a decade, because since inception, Google has consistently created the best consumer-facing maps in the world. And I’m not just talking about coverage—they are top of the class in turn-by-turn navigation, geocoding, satellite imagery layers, street level imagery, place data, and on, and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of today’s newsletter is an allusion to a blog post from a few years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat&quot;&gt;Google Maps’ Moat&lt;/a&gt;, by Justin O'Beirne.¹ He demonstrates, quite convincingly, that Google has a huge head start over Apple in terms of foundational data (e.g. roads, buildings, parks, etc.), especially in the continental United States. But in the years since, Justin has posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/look-around-coverage-areas&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; showing Apple’s steady climb toward parity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Google’s crown jewel, Street View, is under siege—a new initiative from Apple called “Look Around” is pumping out street-level panoramic imagery at a furious clip that’s becoming furiouser and furiouser by the week. Here’s an excerpt from Justin’s last dispatch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fear and Loathing in Mountain View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to knock Big G. They’re still the biggest and best—a Morgan Stanley analyst &lt;a href=&quot;https://skift.com/2019/08/30/google-maps-poised-to-be-an-11-billion-business-in-4-years/&quot;&gt;estimated that Google Maps generated almost $3B in advertising revenue in 2019&lt;/a&gt; alone. But I suspect we’re at the tail end of the golden era for Google Maps. They appear, to me, to be acting from a place of fear and conservatism rather than innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, I had not yet been born (I am, in fact, only six years old). But I am a student of history. Apple Maps launched that year, and it was received so terribly that Tim Cook decided to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2012/09/28/technology/apple-ceo-letter-maps/index.html&quot;&gt;a personal apology&lt;/a&gt; for the state of the app. He even went so far as to recommend that iPhone users download Bing Maps while Apple sorted itself out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, Google’s strategy of investing ungodly sums into Google Maps and keeping all of the data proprietary paid off in spectacular fashion. Apple had pie all over their face and Microsoft had tethered their consumer map product to the Bing brand, which was saddled with a comically inferior reputation in the search domain. Even if Bing Maps had somehow been comparable with Google Maps out of the gate, the average consumer would have associated the brand with being a knock-off of Google anyway. That year, and for many years afterward, Google looked unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then things started to take a turn around 2018, a year after Justin O'Beirne’s seminal summary of Google’s “moat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, Google Maps is not just an app on your phone. It’s also a suite of developer tools that power countless other applications that are used by millions of people every day. And that part of the business is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation&quot;&gt;Google Maps Platform&lt;/a&gt; (but most of the time I hear it referred to as the Google Maps API).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Google inexplicably decided to self-sabotage their enterprise maps business by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/&quot;&gt;raising their prices ~1,400% overnight&lt;/a&gt;. The only time in my life that I’ve ever felt envious of commission-based sales people was in the wake of that announcement — I would have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked to work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/&quot;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt; as an order-taker that following quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, today, you need an MBA with a specialization in Mind Games to understand the Google Maps Platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet&quot;&gt;pricing scheme&lt;/a&gt;, and it helps to have a joint law degree to navigate their &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms&quot;&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the ToS are so Draconian, they’re the subject of investigations by the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law. My favorite tidbit from their recent report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf&quot;&gt;Competition in Digital Markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; quotes an anonymous Google Maps Platform customer&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several developers stated that Google Maps introduced greater licensing restrictions as it gained a stronger market position. One noted that Google’s control over what now serves as a key mapping technology has allowed Google to call all the shots. “We license Google Maps and it’s essentially a contract of adhesion. It’s full of restrictions and we aren’t able to negotiate any changes,” the developer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the actions of an organization that is annoyed they ever let people become their customers. And for what? A few hundred million in fees, maybe? That’s likely nothing compared to the billions in advertising revenue from consumers searching for the best hamburger in town. So why not jack up the prices, lock down the data, and let ‘em churn, baby, churn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, Google isn’t the only game in town anymore. If they keep alienating their customers and pursuing a proprietary data strategy at all costs, they’re going to continue to lose ground to competition while spending more than ever just to tread water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAAMm is Coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear yet that mapping is big business, but it’s quite clear that big business is mapping. The most popular thing I’ve ever written is a piece about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/openstreetmap-is-having-a-moment-dcc7eef1bb01&quot;&gt;incredible year OpenStreetMap is having&lt;/a&gt;, largely because of enormous investment from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Mapbox (FAAMm).²&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s slight advantage in terms of navigation and foundational features may well be overtaken by the collective effort of their deep-pocketed competitors. Google’s remaining edge in street level imagery, place data, and 3D data all seem weaker than at any moment in their history. Challengers are crowding in from all sides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;13.502188868043&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.6995708154506&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to street level imagery, I’m keeping an eye on what Facebook will do with Mapillary, the slew of well-funded HD mapping companies popping up (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepmap.ai/&quot;&gt;DeepMap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carmera.com/&quot;&gt;CARMERA&lt;/a&gt;), and Apple making a concerted effort with Look Around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/pages&quot;&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt; dataset seems like a natural rival to Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview&quot;&gt;Places API&lt;/a&gt; if they ever decide to make a go of it. Yelp &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html&quot;&gt;hates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html&quot;&gt;Google for many reasons&lt;/a&gt; (including an acquisition deal that fell through more than a decade ago) and would make for a suitable acquisition target for any of Google’s many competitors looking to jump-start an assault on their place data dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.9864864864865&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Facebook ever did want to challenge Google with place data, they might consider partnering with someone like AWS. In fact, AWS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itpro.co.uk/cloud/358173/amazon-previewing-its-new-cloud-based-location-service&quot;&gt;just launched its own mapping service&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon Location, loaded with data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esri.com/en-us/home&quot;&gt;Esri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.here.com/&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.83229813664596&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Mapbox’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-gl-js-v2-3d-maps-camera-api-sky-api-launch&quot;&gt;launch of Mapbox GL JS v2.0&lt;/a&gt; is taking direct aim at global 3D data, which Google won’t even deign to offer via their Maps Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.5585585585586&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget about Microsoft getting serious about their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/planetary-computer&quot;&gt;Planetary Computer&lt;/a&gt;” and affiliated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth&quot;&gt;AI for Earth&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which are gearing up to be the stiffest competition &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthengine.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt; has faced to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.2037037037037&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile at an office down the hall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-maps/&quot;&gt;Azure Maps has been humming along quietly since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, beating AWS to the punch by over two years. And Microsoft’s consumer app, Bing Maps, has been investing heavily in automated foundational feature creation, having not only &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data&quot;&gt;openly licensed over 100M AI-generated building footprints&lt;/a&gt; but *also* &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/PretrainedModels/Image.md#resnet&quot;&gt;the model and toolkit used to create them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Google Will Regress to the Mean if Nothing Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite blog posts of all time is Steve Yegge’s missive, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/why-i-left-google-to-join-grab-86dfffc0be84#:~:text=The%20main%20reason%20I%20left,pretty%20much%20lost%20that%20ability.&amp;amp;text=First%2C%20they're%20conservative%3A,norm%20rather%20than%20the%20exception.&quot;&gt;Why I left Google to join Grab&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, he claims the primary reason he is leaving is because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they’re conservative: They are so focused on protecting what they’ve got, that they fear risk-taking and real innovation. Gatekeeping and risk aversion at Google are the norm rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap (OSM), over the next decade, has the potential to do to Google what Android did to Apple: dramatically grow the overall market while drawing a clear line between the larger “open” ecosystem and the smaller “proprietary” one. The difference is that while Google Maps probably makes billions annually, it also probably costs billions to maintain, leaving it wallowing in a low-margin no-man’s land compared to its big brother Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives Google Maps an edge over other experiences? Today, I would argue the three pillars of its comparative advantage are Places, Street View, and 3D data. But in a few years, I think it will mostly just be Places. And shortly thereafter, it may well wind up with no remaining edge beyond convenience and brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe Google can maintain its leading position in the software mapping world for another decade without pivoting to embrace the same open ecosystem that FAAMm is using to challenge them. Imagine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixel8earth.medium.com/should-the-3d-map-of-the-globe-be-a-public-good-c50e3e667b0e&quot;&gt;as my friend Sean Gorman recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;, a world in which the 3D globe was a public good (or, by extension, if all foundational features and places of interest were treated that way). What would that mean for the competitive landscape? ³&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a question of who has the resources to generate the best private datasets and protect their proprietary nature, the battleground of competitive advantage would shift to user experience, convenience, and creativity. And, in my opinion, Google has an edge there over FAAMm—the more Google Maps can tie into GSuite and the rest of their prodigious ecosystem of popular applications, the more they can differentiate on superior user experience and less they have to rely on superior data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google doesn’t start taking the Google Maps Platform seriously, they’ll slowly but surely find themselves alone on an island of inferior, less frequently updated, and expensive-to-maintain proprietary data. A new generation of innovative apps built on top of OSM will feast like piranhas on a cow treading water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there are three major strategic decisions that could position them to maintain their leadership position into the next decade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride the OSM wave instead of fighting it. Foundational feature data is becoming commoditized, but Google could make it collectivized. By combining efforts with OSM more broadly, Google could reduce its cost basis moving forward and free up resources for competing at what they’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; great at: building great software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosen up licensing restrictions on the Maps Platform generally. Allow customers to digitize features visible in Street View imagery, for instance. Grant permission to users who want to mix-and-match your geocoding service with a beautifully-styled basemap from Mapbox. You’re stifling countless creative uses for your services while fighting against an irresistible force that the core of your search business is built upon: information wants to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressively price services to grow the overall market. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is likely an outsized share of the future of your business—Microsoft and Amazon clearly understand this about themselves. But when it comes to maps, you have the lead. By mis-pricing your maps API, you’re taking a cracked door and slamming it wide open for your competitors. And for what? Do you really need the incremental revenue today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ Who is Justin O’Beirne? I am confident he worked at Apple based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.justia.com/inventor/justin-o-beirne&quot;&gt;publicly available patent applications&lt;/a&gt; in his name, but I don’t think he still works there or else they’d probably be pissed at him for writing publicly about their work (they are notoriously secretive). He keeps an incredibly low profile—no LinkedIn profile that I can find, no Github profile, and perhaps most confusingly, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/justinobeirne&quot;&gt;Twitter profile&lt;/a&gt; that was deleted earlier this montf &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mouthofmorrison/status/1341516137176023040?s=20&quot;&gt;after I mentioned it&lt;/a&gt; publicly (but which had no tweets, a blank profile picture, and thousands of followers). I love a good mystery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;² Sorry, Mapbox, but you don’t get a capital letter. Sure, you’re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-new-target-in-antitrust-battle-against-google-maps&quot;&gt;billion-dollar juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; and a massive company by any normal measure, but your conspirators are each valued at over one trillion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;³ The recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.placekey.io/&quot;&gt;Placekey initiative&lt;/a&gt; deserves a shoutout here. I still don’t understand it (sorry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/auren&quot;&gt;Auren&lt;/a&gt;!), but it provides at least some evidence that there is widespread appetite for more openness and shared standards around common geospatial datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it &quot;initimidation surveillance&quot; as it lacks the aspect of &quot;covert&quot; type of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1o1xvo000j7ioo352apwdw@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;155&quot;&gt;Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini. At first, the evidence was purely anecdotal. My boyfriend and I would bravely venture to both our local Italian grocer and our local chain groceries, masked beyond recognition, searching in vain for the bucatini that, in my opinion, not to be dramatic, is the only noodle worth eating; all other dry pastas might as well be firewood. But where there had once been abundance, there was now only lack. Being educated noodle consumers, we knew that there was, more generally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/business/2020/05/pasta-shortage-coronavirus-why.html&quot;&gt;a pasta shortage due to the pandemic,&lt;/a&gt; but we were still able to find spaghetti and penne and orecchiette — shapes which, again, insult me even in concept. The missing bucatini felt different. It was specific. Frightening. Why bucatini? Why now? Why us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oev6y002a3d6bgyymwvl8@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;100&quot;&gt;We began to talk about it, quietly and carefully, in May. “Are you guys having trouble finding bucatini? We haven’t found any in a while,” said my friend Dan, one of my most bucatini-headed friends, during an otherwise innocuous Saturday-evening Zoom session. I felt a chill, like I’d seen a ghost, perhaps the ghost of Pietro Barilla, founder of the Barilla pasta empire. “We actually … haven’t been able to find it either,” I said. The conversation halted as dramatically as if we’d just seen someone stabbed to death with a bucatini noodle inside one of the little Zoom windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oevfp002b3d6bpt8eu52h@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;54&quot;&gt;Our other friends stared at us in horror. “I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; haven’t been able to find any bucatini, actually,” said another friend, slowly. “Maybe it’s just a temporary thing, and maybe it’s just in our neighborhoods,” I said, feeling the fear rise like pasta water in my throat. “I’m sure the bucatini will come back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oevle002c3d6bh3hkq5n2@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;177&quot;&gt;But it did not come back. Spring turned to summer (allegedly; there is no hard proof of time actually moving forward). Summer turned to fall. All the while we searched high and low for bucatini, at Whole Foods and Russo’s and New York Market and Key Food, our friends searching at City Acres and Food Town and Brooklyn Harvest, stumbling upon it only occasionally and then panic-buying it, then feeling bad for panic-buying it, then repeating the cycle. As Dan’s partner, Chanan, recently recalled, “All I know is, once it ran out, it stopped being replaced. We’ve had to compromise and eat spaghetti, fusilli, and rigatoni. It’s an added layer of uncertainty during an uncertain time.” Still, we pressed forward, pretending things were fine, forcing smiles when we knew deep down all we wanted was to wring our hands and scream into the dark sky. Our only solace was that we assumed this was likely a New York–specific problem, one that, if we really wanted to solve, we could do so by traveling discreetly to another state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oevqe002d3d6blk5bluxd@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;120&quot;&gt;Would it be worth renting a car to drive to a store in New Jersey, or possibly Pennsylvania, to buy bags of dried pasta? For bucatini, we considered it. Bucatini is spaghetti but thicker and with a hole in it, meaning it absorbs 200 percent more sauce than its thinner, hole-free brethren, due to math. When asked via email for comment on bucatini’s allure, New York City pasta magnate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/01/making-sauce-with-chef-frank-prisinzano.html&quot;&gt;Frank Prisinzano&lt;/a&gt; simply told me, “Lol it’s spaghetti with a hole in it. Who doesn’t like that?” In 2018, &lt;em&gt;Bon Appétit&lt;/em&gt; deemed it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bucatini-best-long-pasta&quot;&gt;“best long pasta,”&lt;/a&gt; citing its powerful sauce-absorption capabilities and its general slurpiness. Bucatini Head Dan put it thusly: “There’s something about the hole. It feels more luxurious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oevud002e3d6bjxura3fz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;91&quot;&gt;I’d like to go a step further and praise its innate bounciness and personality. If you boil bucatini for 50 percent of the time the box tells you to, cooking it perfectly al dente, you will experience a textural experience like nothing else you have encountered in your natural life. When cooked correctly, bucatini bites back. It is a responsive noodle. It is a self-aware noodle. In these times, when human social interaction carries with it the possible price of illness, bucatini offers an alternative: a social interaction with a pasta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oew18002f3d6bwqlskz93@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;60&quot;&gt;But the problem, I would learn, was not limited to New York. In the fall, I was speaking with my mother, a longtime resident of suburban Chicago, and, as it often does, the conversation quickly turned to pasta. “Rachel,” my mother said gravely. “I haven’t been able to find bucatini anywhere at home. Do you have any in New York?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oewm5002g3d6b3xmpll98@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;3&quot;&gt;My heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

What are you telling me right now?” I asked, trying to keep my voice level. “I am telling you,” she said, “that I have not been able to find any bucatini in months.” She had even taken the step of writing an (extreme mom energy) email to the head of customer service at De Cecco, her preferred bucatini brand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a HUGE fan of Bucatini pasta. I have not been able to find it for many weeks at any store. It is my favorite pasta to cook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARE YOU STILL MAKING IT????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me how to get some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ofiuv002q3d6bcvyd9ow5@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;120&quot;&gt;Bucatini HQ had replied to her in Italian: “BUONGIORNO SIG. Si sono sempre in produzione. Mi potete fornire il paese.” (“GOOD MORNING SIR. Yes, they are always in production. Can you supply me with the country.”) My mother had explained where she was, then shortly thereafter had received a phone call from a man named Brian who was, apparently, her regional De Cecco sales executive. He left a voicemail: “I did get your message that you’re seeking bucatini,” said Brian. “Bucatini is on FDA hold. We are still producing it, but there were some issues, some hiccups with the FDA. Unfortunately, it’s not likely we’ll have bucatini until January at best. I’d look for it in February back on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ofq75002v3d6b7mv119ce@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;157&quot;&gt;I instantly decided that as a serious journalist, it was my duty to figure out what the literal fuck was going on. I Googled “bucatini shortage” and found only one article on the topic from April 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wmagazine.com/story/bowen-yang-snl-club-quarantine-w-challenge/&quot;&gt;wherein &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; star and Vulture alum Bowen Yang&lt;/a&gt; lamented to &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; magazine, “There’s more of a bucatini scarcity problem than there is a toilet-paper issue, I think.” Bolstered by Bowen’s confirmation, I then pitched this very story you’re now reading at the next &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; Magazine brainstorm and instantly received a frantic chat from my co-worker Matthew Schneier: “Just have to say a huge THANK YOU. My sister and I have been plagued by this mystery for months.” When I mentioned the story to other friends in other cities, almost all of them confirmed that they, too, had been unable to find the noodle in their various urban and rural settings. I also found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/offbeatorbit/status/1328105711679791104?s=20&quot;&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/angiejwkim/status/1327439728518569986?s=21&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alyman007/status/1219028961746935808?s=21&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goldenxfineline/status/1302444518512365569?s=21&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1og0bq00353d6brzev6d4b@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;155&quot;&gt;I began my inquiry by reaching out to De Cecco, sending several messages to the Italian email address that had replied to my mom, then calling poor Brian and leaving him multiple messages. After a week, I had still received no reply, confirming my suspicion that something extremely insane was going on. My natural next stop was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilovepasta.org/&quot;&gt;National Pasta Association&lt;/a&gt;, which I was pleased to discover actually does exist and is not just a fever dream I once had. I knew that if anyone would know what to do, it would be the NPA. Quickly, it set me up for a phone interview with Rosario Del Nero, a whimsically charming chef and spokesperson for the organization. When I asked if he had heard about the bucatini shortage, he laughed wildly and replied in a thick Italian accent: “Of course! It’s me! I have bought them all! Bucatini is the most sensual of the pastas!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognev003a3d6bmd5gmxip@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;209&quot;&gt;After ten minutes of conversation about why bucatini is sexy and which sauces go best with bucatini, we got down to business. Rosario told me that he’d heard nothing about a bucatini shortage, but suspected bucatini had just gotten caught up in the larger churn of the pasta shortage. “Dry pasta is typically extruded, pushed through a big die made of bronze. Spaghetti, you push it through once and it just comes out. Bucatini is much more complicated, because of the hole, the center.” Chef Rosario continued: “It’s a specialty shape, and it’s trendy — there was a bucatini craze even before the pasta shortage,” he explained, attributing its relatively newfound popularity in part to Alison Roman’s shallot &lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020830-caramelized-shallot-pasta&quot;&gt;pasta recipe&lt;/a&gt; (which, in its purest form, calls for bucatini) and what he called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bucatini-all-amatriciana-2&quot;&gt;Amatriciana craze”&lt;/a&gt; of the past few years (another recipe that generally calls for bucatini). Despite these dual crazes, he explained, bucatini is “not as popular” as your spaghettis and your pennes, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fact, combined with its complex creation process, meant that it was likely one of the first shapes to suffer during the shortage. “If you have a difficulty making pasta, first you make the [types] with the most demand,” he said, sounding reasonable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognew003b3d6bqjp14jtn@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;107&quot;&gt;But I sensed something more sinister was afoot, specifically regarding De Cecco–brand bucatini and its alleged skirmish with the FDA. Rosario expressed surprise at this, telling me he hadn’t heard anything about any kind of &lt;em&gt;situazione&lt;/em&gt; with the FDA. “Maybe we’ll find some conspiracy, some worldwide thing,” he said, delighted. “That would be phenomenal. You would be remembered as the whistle-blower of the bucatini world crisis.” When I told him that De Cecco’s rep had been ignoring me, he gasped. “Maybe he’s been silenced!” he said. Rosario said he’d get back to me when he’d done his own internal investigating — and he did, mere moments later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognex003c3d6b11u9wwi5@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;25&quot;&gt;“Rachel!” he roared. “I’ve touched closely to the reason. Because of the environment, people have been using bucatini as straws, instead of a plastic straw.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognex003d3d6blu9t0upz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;5&quot;&gt;“I’m sorry, what?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ogney003e3d6b8o3k7nbo@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;101&quot;&gt;“Yes. You can buy them. There are a couple of companies making them. You can have your soda and then eat your straw,” he said. “It’s like eating your fork or knife.” My mind reeled as it tried to understand and accept this information as true. “But pasta is not a ready-to-eat product,” Rosario added. “You have to cook it. So when you use pasta to drink sodas, you’re drinking and eating a not-ready-to-eat product. You put yourself at risk because that product has never been pasteurized or killed. And the only pasta cut affected is bucatini because of the hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ogney003f3d6ba455ms9d@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;98&quot;&gt;This made both perfect sense and absolutely no fucking sense at all, the sort of demented-timeline event that could only happen in 2020, when everything is, metaphorically, an innocent piece of pasta turned into a straw in a bid to help the environment that actually ends up being fatally dangerous. I confessed to Rosario that every time I made bucatini, I ate several raw strands per minute as I cooked it, as a sort of barometer of al dente–ness. I wondered if I was now going to die because of it, and I made peace with this instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognez003g3d6b1tj1w9ad@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;89&quot;&gt;After a pause, Rosario replied, “I think the risk is probably one in a billion. I wouldn’t worry too much.” Even so, he seemed nearly certain that the pasta straws were the reason behind the FDA “hiccup” and promised that we would “get to the bottom of it.” We still weren’t sure: Did the FDA hold apply to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; bucatini, or just De Cecco — and if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; just De Cecco, and the issue &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; pasta straws, why was De Cecco being singled out as a pasta-straw perpetrator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ognez003h3d6b52qp67g4@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;92&quot;&gt;To gather more information on the ever-deepening noodle mystery, Rosario directed me to Carl Zuanelli, the chairman of the National Pasta Association and CEO of Nuovo Pasta. But before I spoke with Carl, I sent an email to the FDA asking, in as professional a tone as I could muster, what the ever-loving hell was going on. Then I did a deep dive into the FDA website, where, to my great shock, I found a buried couple of jargon-y paragraphs published on March 30, 2020, that did indeed mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1144.html&quot;&gt;De Cecco bucatini.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When I got on the phone with Carl, the NPA chairman, I read the FDA paragraph out loud to him; he seemed just as surprised as Rosario had been. “You informed me about this,” he said. He then broke down the jargon for me, explaining that “many years ago” the U.S. government had mandated that pasta — which they call “macaroni,” like they’re the Sopranos — be made with “enriched flours,” with certain minimum and maximum criteria for various sorts of vitamins and nutrients (which is why pastas in the U.S. are labeled as “&lt;em&gt;enriched&lt;/em&gt; macaroni products”). In Europe, which houses the grand nation of Italy, where De Cecco is made, the standards of identity are different. (“Not better or worse,” Carl explained, “just different.”) So while the De Cecco bucatini might have been “in balance” for the E.U., the U.S. had found its iron levels lacking — specifically by 2.1 milligrams. This, to me, seemed both petty and confusing. Why had the FDA singled out De Cecco in the first place to test its iron levels? Why were they quibbling over such a small number? And if the issue was specific to De Cecco, why were we all experiencing a shortage of bucatini more generally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oh5zd003w3d6b9qnyw1to@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;77&quot;&gt;I continued my campaign to reach someone, anyone, at De Cecco for an explanation and timeline for resolution. I asked Carl for a contact, and he said he assumed they would reply soon. “I don’t see why they wouldn’t. I would think they’d want to and get more bucatini press.” Carl’s contact did not reply, and when I called them, their phone number did that fuzzy-dial-up thing where it sounded like someone signing into AOL in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oh5zd003x3d6bba25j01j@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;206&quot;&gt;I emailed Dave De Cecco, who I imagined to be the heir to the De Cecco empire, by guessing his email address multiple times. He did not reply, and later I realized he may not be at all related to the De Ceccos, which is another investigation for another time.* I emailed De Cecco’s export department, which replied simply, “First of all thank you for your interest in De Cecco brand. With reference to your kind email I inform you that your request has been forwarded to our department in charge. In case of interest they will put in touch directly with you. Thank you once again for contacting us and remain at your disposal for further assistance.” But they were not at my disposal for further assistance. I finally got Brian, the midwestern De Cecco sales executive, on the phone by calling him anonymously, and he seemed startled and displeased by my call. “Oh gosh, I’m probably the worst person to talk to about that,” he said. “I don’t have any more insight into it.” He gave me the email and phone number of a supply-chain guy named Marco, who never replied to my messages and whose voice mailbox has been full for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oh5zf003y3d6bit2cd6pc@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;153&quot;&gt;In the meantime, the FDA finally replied to me, despite the fact that it was very busy approving a life-saving vaccine for billions of people. “Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts, we are unable to participate in a phone interview at this time,” wrote a spokesperson named Courtney, with more politeness than I deserved, as I was, again, bothering her with questions about noodles during an unprecedented express vaccine effort. “However, on March 30, 2020, De Cecco bucatini was placed on import alert because it was misbranded as it failed to meet the required standard of identity. Specifically, the iron level in De Cecco bucatini was below the designated level as required by the standard of enriched macaroni.” When I asked whether De Cecco was trying to fix this issue or how the FDA had even discovered the issue in the first place, Courtney replied, “It’s an extremely busy time for us at FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oh5zh003z3d6be6vlyvqj@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;60&quot;&gt;Seeing that Courtney was not going to give me all of the answers I needed, I decided to file an FOIA with the FDA requesting access to, and copies of, all documents related to the import alert for De Cecco’s bucatini product. I also requested a rush on the documents, writing by way of explanation that “people deserve to know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1ohlmi004a3d6btx2d6occ@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;76&quot;&gt;As I waited impatiently for the FDA’s FOIA reply, I got another call from Carl from the NPA, who blew my mind with a tale that sounded so Coen brothers–y I could not believe it. The reason behind De Cecco’s fall from FDA grace, he said, could potentially be traced all the way back to the early 1900s and the beginning of what was once called the “National Association of Macaroni and Noodle Manufacturers of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrj004g3d6b74a8pria@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;219&quot;&gt;Around World War II, Carl explained, the established noodle industry (henceforth referred to as Big Pasta) was “upset” by the introduction of Nissin’s ramen noodles into the country, which were “completely out of spec” with what the United States then recognized as noodles — specifically because the ramen was being sold for a lower price and with what Carl called “lower standards” of nutrition. “They were really pressed,” said Carl. That’s when the “standards of identity” were created: Big Pasta made sure that all noodles had to meet certain specifications to be considered “enriched macaroni products” and sold in the United States. As time went on, it would seem, the petty beef spun out into a juicier beef, with the main agitators of Big Pasta turning on each other. Nearly 120 years after the Macaroni and Noodle Manufacturers’s inception, that beef finally came for De Cecco. Weeks after we were first in touch, Courtney replied to tell me that De Cecco’s products were “collected as routine surveillance of imported products,” but Carl had a more intriguing theory: “It sounds as if someone was not happy with De Cecco’s product coming in and looked at it and saw that it was out of spec,” he said. “The FDA doesn’t typically go around looking. They’ve got plenty of other things to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrm004h3d6bkfh6pt9s@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;123&quot;&gt;Thrilled by the &lt;em&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/em&gt; of it all, I reached out to a legal source who asked not to be named but who has deep knowledge of the inner workings of Big Pasta. The legal source, whom I will call Luigi for fun but whose real name is very different from that, confirmed Carl’s suspicions. “FDA is quite slow to take action involving standards violations. I’m speculating that a competitor put some heavy pressure on FDA,” he said. “It’s not the only way this happens, but for the FDA to put any resources into this, it would have to be somebody who really cared with some clout. Maybe a competitor who brought in a member of Congress to pressure the agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrn004i3d6brdsj5733@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;104&quot;&gt;When I told Luigi that De Cecco was dodging me, he laughed. “That doesn’t surprise me,” he said. “I suppose they just don’t want to comment.” But he reiterated that there was no real reason the FDA would “sample a macaroni product for enrichment levels at the border unless they got some info and received some pressure to go after it.” Luigi also told me that this was entirely legal and absolutely kosher. With regards to my FOIA, Luigi told me that it would likely be declined on the basis of “documents related to an ongoing enforcement action — but that tells you something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidro004j3d6bacdz0nls@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;167&quot;&gt;Invigorated, I reached out to several pasta manufacturers to see if they would speak to me about the greater bucatini shortage. The only one that hopped on the phone with me was Barilla. A representative for the company — who was an extremely good sport and discussed the significance of sauce coverage with me for several minutes — confirmed that Barilla had, in fact, pruned its bucatini SKU, along with several other shapes, solely owing to the sheer demand of pasta during the pandemic. She also told me they’d seen an increased demand for bucatini owing to its elegance and restaurant-like quality, and that this combination had, indeed, created a mild Barilla bucatini shortage. She did comfort me mildly by saying that the company had started to slowly increase production back in July and that we’d begin to see it back in normal quantities sometime soon. “We still have to ration it throughout the country so everyone gets a little bit of their favorite shape,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrq004k3d6bkyyepq8o@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;66&quot;&gt;I asked casually if she was at all familiar with De Cecco’s bucatini shortage. “No. I’m not aware,” she said. “Have you had any FDA kerfuffles?” I asked, twirling my hair around my finger even though she could not see me because we were on the phone. “No,” she said, clarifying that Barilla pasta has always contained “adequate levels” of enrichment. “We’ve never had that issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrq004l3d6beymtm9s7@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;157&quot;&gt;Carl, who was by now becoming audibly exhausted by me, confirmed that he’d heard from several pasta manufacturers, some of whom were on the list of those that did not reply to me (including Ronzoni, Prince, and Treehouse), that they were, similarly, “severely pruning back the different cuts in order to have longer runs of the most popular cuts, just to produce it as efficiently as they can.” Carl added, “I’m not saying there’s a bucatini shortage. I’m saying the less popular SKUs, of which bucatini is one, have been on their cut list.” He also told me, sighing, that, “frankly, due to your investigatory work,” &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was now working to standardize the standards of identity between countries. “What had been an issue in our legal-affairs committee is now anecdotal, based on the info you’re giving me, affecting negatively some members of our association, i.e., De Cecco,” he said. “I am working behind the scenes on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrq004m3d6bi0si75wg@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Carl didn’t say it, but I was pretty sure he thought about calling me “the Bernstein of Bucatini” and that my work will now help to fix the standards-of-identity issue that has long plagued our fair continents. I had confirmed that the bucatini shortage was real and understood that the bucatini shortage was a combination of factors: the pandemic’s pasta demand, how hard it is to make bucatini because of its hole, De Cecco’s strange and untimely barring from the U.S. border. But these victories felt lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.grubstreet.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckj1oidrr004n3d6b57yje0rv@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;118&quot;&gt;Ultimately, I had more questions than I did answers. I did not, for example, understand who from Big Pasta had targeted De Cecco and why. I was also slightly worried that I had inadvertently made &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt; a target of Big Pasta. And more importantly, I did not know if I would get to taste De Cecco’s brilliant, sentient noodle ever again. At time of press, I am still waiting for the fruits of my FOIA request, as well as for literally anyone from De Cecco to reply to me. De Cecco, if you’re reading this: Please contact me immediately, then also put 2.1 milligrams of iron into your freaking bucatini and help rescue us from this national nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

Fujifilm has been investigating Strontium Ferrite as a possible successor to Barium Ferrite (BaFe), which is the leading material today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;767&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magnetictapestructure.jpg 767w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magnetictapestructure-320x170.jpg 320w&quot; data-src=&quot;http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magnetictapestructure.jpg&quot; data-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-498639 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;The structure of magnetic tape.
&lt;p&gt;SrFe has been found to have higher magnetic characteristics and 60% less particle volume than BaFe. And like BaFe, SrFe is a chemically stable oxide, meaning it should perform well for long-term data preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magneticcloseup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-498640&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magneticcloseup.jpg 640w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/12/magneticcloseup-320x119.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;Electron microscope images of the cross-section of magnetic tapes.
&lt;p&gt;“SrFe is a magnetic material that has very high magnetic properties and is stable to maintain high performance even when processed into fine particles,” Fujifilm says. “Magnetic tapes used in this test have been produced at the company’s existing coating facility, confirming the ability to support mass production and commercialization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on the tape is stored at a record-breaking density of 317 gigabytes per square inch thanks to new technologies developed by IBM, including a new low friction tape head technology and the actuators and servos behind it. The head’s speed and accuracy are remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just let me geek out for a second,” writes IBM research manager Mark Lantz. “When tape is being read it is streamed over the head at a speed of about 15 km/h and with our new servo technologies we are still able to position the tape head with an accuracy that is about 1.5 times the width of a DNA molecule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting data storage capacity of the new tapes is roughly 50 times greater than the current cartridges on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;The progression of record-breaking magnetic tape storage capacities.
&lt;p&gt;To put 580 terabytes in perspective, it’s roughly the equivalent of 120,000 DVDs or 786,977 CDs — IBM notes that stacking that many CDs would result in a tower 3,097 feet (944m) tall, or taller than Burj Kalifa, the world’s tallest building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that data can now fit in a tape cartridge in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In terms of costs, storing data on tape is pennies per gigabyte and when not in use, tape requires no energy unlike hard disks and flash,” IBM &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2020/12/tape-density-record/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. “Put simply, tape-stored data ensures that cloud providers will have the data they need when they need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition, when stored properly, data recorded on tape today will still be readable in 30 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Small drones will be allowed to fly over people and at night in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday, a significant step toward their use for widespread commercial deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The FAA said its long-awaited rules for the drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, will address security concerns by requiring remote identification technology in most cases to enable their identification from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Previously, small drone operations over people were limited to operations over people who were directly participating in the operation, located under a covered structure, or inside a stationary vehicle - unless operators had obtained a waiver from the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The rules will take effect 60 days after publication in the federal register in January. Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to begin producing drones with Remote ID, and operators will have an additional year to provide Remote ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;There are other, more complicated rules that allow for operations at night and over people for larger drones in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;“The new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. “They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Companies have been racing to create drone fleets to speed deliveries. The United States has over 1.7 million drone registrations and 203,000 FAA-certificated remote pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;For at-night operations, the FAA said drones must be equipped with anti-collision lights. The final rules allow operations over moving vehicles in some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Remote ID is required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more, but is required for smaller drones under certain circumstances like flights over open-air assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The new rules eliminate requirements that drones be connected to the internet to transmit location data but do that they broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast. Without the change, drone use could have been barred from use in areas without internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International said Remote ID will function as “a digital license plate for drones ... that will enable more complex operations” while operations at night and over people “are important steps towards enabling integration of drones into our national airspace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;One change, since the rules were first proposed in 2019, requires that small drones not have any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;United Parcel Service Inc said in October 2019 that it won the government’s first full approval to operate a drone airline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Last year, Alphabet’s Wing, a sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;In August, Amazon.com Inc’s drone service received federal approval allowing the retailer to begin testing commercial deliveries through its drone fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x&quot;&gt;Walmart Inc said in September it would run a pilot project for delivery of grocery and household products through automated drones but acknowledged “it will be some time before we see millions of packages delivered via drone.”&lt;/p&gt;
