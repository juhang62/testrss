&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator is (arguably) the best place in the world for an early-stage startup. Yet, this doesn’t mean all their projects are a resounding success. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup failure rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are extremely high, and while the amazing network, know-how, and access to resources of YC can help their companies, there is no such thing as a guaranteed success in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycdb.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YC database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over the last 15 years (and 30 startup batches) YC has invested in more than 2200 companies. Out of these, there are more than 400 who are officially inactive. A 20% failure rate sounds amazing for the industry, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The majority of YC investments have happened in the last few years (over 1500 in the last 5). This means most companies in their portfolio are too young to have shut down already. If we take companies only from the first 17 YC batches, the rate of inactive companies doubles to about 40%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These numbers don’t include all the active companies who are struggling (and unlikely) to achieve any meaningful success (an example below), and more importantly: the investments that are exited at a loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that a significant number of startups fail even if they benefit from the best possible conditions in the world. The goal of this article isn’t to put YC down, but rather to let all of us learn from the cases where things don’t go according to plan despite all the great preconditions for success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below you’ll find information about some of YC’s biggest failures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is YC and why are YC startups less likely to fail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator created a new model for investing in early-stage startups – they are the first-ever seed accelerator in the world. Before we start with the list of YC’s failed startups, here are the most important things you need to know about the accelerator and the value they bring to their companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What YC does and why it’s extremely valuable for startups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;YC runs a &lt;strong&gt;three-month accelerator program&lt;/strong&gt; in which they help early-stage startups with seed &lt;strong&gt;funding, connections, advice, mentorship&lt;/strong&gt;. The program finishes with a demo day, on which the startup teams present their business to outside investors (usually seed and VC investment funds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They run the program twice a year, hence they have the &lt;strong&gt;summer and winter startup batches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They usually make the &lt;strong&gt;first outside investment&lt;/strong&gt; into the early-stage companies they accept into the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investment amount for the accelerator program is currently &lt;strong&gt;$125k&lt;/strong&gt; (down from $150k). That said, they have a “Continuity” fund that might provide further funding for their accelerator alumni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In return for their seed investment, they take a &lt;strong&gt;7% share in the business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, the real value of YC isn’t in the seed investment. It is in the incredible &lt;strong&gt;network&lt;/strong&gt; of startup entrepreneurs, tech and marketing experts, and investors that they foster. A smart founder could use this network as leverage helping them turn a good idea into a profitable business – arguably the biggest reason for YC’s lower failure rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YC’s Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;YC has invested in and mentored more than 2200 companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of their biggest successes are Stripe, Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, Docker, twitch.tv, Zapier, Heroku, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The combined valuation of YC companies is over $100B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YC has 18 unicorns (businesses worth over $1 billion) and 110 companies worth over $100 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their history and success, YC’s accelerator programs are extremely popular. Each year the number of companies that apply and are accepted increases: in 2006, only 18 companies participated in the summer and winter programs, while in 2019 YC invested in and mentored 350 startups. Their acceptance rate is around 2%, which means that the total applicants for 2019 were around 17k – approaching 10k startups per batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting into the YC program is a huge success on its own, so it’s very important for the accepted companies not to waste the opportunity. We did a very interesting interview with Richard Wu, the co-founder of Simmer, who participated in the 2019 YC winter batch, talking about his&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.failory.com/blog/yc-mistakes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mistakes during the YC accelerator program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Failed YC Startups based on Funding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atrium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Legal Tech and Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: &amp;gt;$75M from 100+ investors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employees: 100-250&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Augie Rakow, Bebe Chueh, Chris Smoak, Justin Kan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closed date: Mar 4, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atrium was an innovative law firm targeting startups and aiming to provide a better service than traditional law firms with the help of proprietary technology. It raised about $75M in funding in 5 rounds and was headed by CEO Justin Kan, the famous founder of justin.tv (later twitch.tv) with an exit to Amazon close to a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atrium vision was to create a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;full-stack vertical startup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – to own the whole supply chain and to provide a complete A-Z legal service to clients. While this is certainly a viable goal in the long run (some of the biggest and most successful tech companies are full stack), it seems a bit foolish to try to achieve this right out of the gate. It seems like a classic case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupgenome.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-the-anatomy-of-premature-scaling-new-infographic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;premature scaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Today is it not all about being more lean and agile? Being “full-stack” is surely the opposite of that.” –Brian Inkster,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thetimeblawg.com/2020/03/07/atrium-a-post-mortem/#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%20(3%20March%202020,than%20a%20traditional%20law%20firm%E2%80%9D.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source TheTimeBlawg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrium was burning through money very fast while failing to generate meaningful revenue. In an attempt to pivot, they decided to focus entirely on their technology and cut their legal division (the lawyers working for them). This move didn’t work out in the long run and when they ran out of money they were forced to close doors. Ironically, after the final shutdown of the firm, the only surviving remnant is their still-working downsized legal division. The tech stack they were focusing on failed to generate any real value and as far as we are aware wasn’t acquired by another company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;uBiome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Healthcare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: $109.9M from 23 investors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employees: 100-250&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Jessica Richman, Zachary Apte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;uBiome’s goal was to use &lt;em&gt;“Big Data and crowdscience to unlock the secrets of the human microbiome”.&lt;/em&gt; However, things didn’t go according to plan. The FBI raided the San Francisco offices of the company because of suspicions uBiome was billing its client’s medical insurance providers multiple times without the prior knowledge or consent of their clients. At the same time, they were pressuring doctors to approve tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uBiome was essentially trying to growth-hack their way to a higher revenue number without at the same time providing additional value to their clients (and at the expense of medical insurers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth-hacking on the wild-west which is the internet is one thing, but when you try to use similar tactics in traditional, heavily regulated industries in developed, heavily regulated markets - that’s a recipe for disaster. The tech startup moto of “grow first, deal with the legal implications later” might not be ideal for all industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging from the fact that the company wasn’t able to secure more funding or even to find a buyer, it’s safe to assume that the technology and know-how they had was underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secrets of the human microbiome remain locked, for now, despite the Valley’s efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Augmented Reality, Consumer Electronics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: $73.0M from 21 investors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Ben Sand, Meron Gribetz, Raymond Lo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta was making an augmented reality headset. Unlike the examples from above, a bit more happenstance is involved in their demise. The Trump administration’s trade war with China resulted in a failed funding round led by a Chinese investor, which put the company in dire straits financially. They were forced to let go of most of their workforce, and later on, the bank holding the debt of the company foreclosed the loan and sold all of Meta’s assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also unlike the companies from above, a buyer was found, which means that the technology that Meta was developing was valuable even though the company wasn’t making enough money to make ends meet on its own (yet). The information about the deal is not public, but the CEO Meron Gribetz mentioned that he was encouraged by the deal: &lt;em&gt;“I feel like it’s a good home for the Meta assets, and that it could provide a future for them.” (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18187315/meta-vision-ar-headset-company-asset-sale-unknown-buyer-insolvent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the tech developed by Meta could create value for its new owner and their clients, it’s extremely unlikely that YC and consequent investors in the company managed to recoup their losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Healthcare, Health Tech, Telemedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: $34M from 10 investors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employees: 100&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders Celina Tenev, Timothy Peck, XiaoSong Mu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise of Call9 was to enable patients in nursing homes to receive remote emergency medical consultations, hopefully avoiding the stressful wait for an ambulance and in an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.failory.com/cemetery/call9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reason for Call9’s failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is complex, but it boils down to trouble with the adoption of the “value-based care” business model – paying for the value provided, rather than the time of the specialist. The company was burning significantly more money than what it was making and eventually had to lay off its 100 employees. They tried to make partnerships with medical insurance providers on the basis of saving them money by preventing unnecessary trips to the emergency room, but even though this seems very reasonable, they didn’t manage to move the needle enough to keep the doors open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boosted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Micromobility (electric longboards and scooters)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: $73.0M from 16 investors &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: John Ulmen, Matthew Tran, Sanjay Dastoor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure for the investors (YC included) doesn’t necessarily mean a full shutdown of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware businesses are capital intensive and usually operate on low margins, which means that any disturbance in the supply chain can cause a great deal of trouble. Boosted, who practically established the electric longboard niche with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;successful Kickstarter campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to lay off most of its employees when the Trump administration started the tariff wars with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is dire not only for Boosted, however. Fellow YC-backed electric scooter startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/business/unicorn-e-scooter-startup-fails-refunds-uncertain/2192561/#:~:text=Nick%20Evans%2C%20founder%20and%20CEO,were%20going%20up%20and%20up.%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unicorn Rides (part of the very recent Winter 2019 YC batch) went belly up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because of economic reasons. Competitor electric longboard manufacturers Inboard also shut down recently. And the e-bike startup Wheels was forced to let employees go despite raising $100 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite a clear illustration that even Y Combinator, with all of their muscle and know-how, cannot bend market forces at will. Even their big investments who have impressively managed to validate an innovative product are subject to political and market risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Boosted manages to survive due to downsizing and hopefully improving market conditions, they are unlikely to miraculously start growing and claiming considerable market share. Their first-mover advantage is not particularly valuable if competitors outside of the US start producing a good-enough, cheaper product. All of this means that the $70 million investment in the company is in significant trouble even if the company doesn’t close doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup investors make their money from big exit events fueled by rapid growth (and, frankly, a monopolistic position in the market). Getting $70 million back from dividend payments of a downsized company is not viable. So, the more likely outcome is that investors will try to recoup some losses by selling their shares (or the whole company) at a large discount to another business interested in the niche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other Failed YC Startups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of other examples of failed startups that participated in the YC accelerator programs. Although they are usually much smaller and didn’t attract media attention, they might be more representative of the more common reasons YC startups (and startups in general) fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memamp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industry: Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding: Seed round by YC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder: Chris Slowe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memamp was one of the first companies ever funded by YC, and they were trying to develop a better search solution for desktop. The reason the company closed, however, is pretty simple: both Google and Apple announced they would develop their own desktop search solution (Spotlight and Desktop Search). All of a sudden there was no market need for what Memamp was developing, and the company was dead before YC’s summer founders program was even complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Buttermilk Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Food Delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Funding: $120K from YC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Mitra Raman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttermilk participated in the Summer of 2018 startup batch and is one of the many early-stage startups that don’t manage to grow the business successfully. The reasons for the failure are presented in a bit more details by the founder in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ramannoodlez/goodbye-buttermilk-ca570be4b56b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his Medium post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the gist of it is pretty common for the startup industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Burnout:&lt;/strong&gt; running a startup is extremely taxing, and doing it as a solo founder - even more so. Burnout followed by depression and other mental health problems isn’t uncommon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unit Economics:&lt;/strong&gt; scaling a consumer product goods company is much more difficult than scaling a digital product/service because of the marginal costs of production. This is even more difficult in the food and beverage market which is extremely competitive and customers expect a low price even for high-quality goods. This means that scaling a successful MVP experiment to a real business is a big problem for startups in the niche.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retail or bust:&lt;/strong&gt; distributing a product online and distributing it through a retail network are two very distinct problems. Customers often expect to be able to find food products in retail networks, which is another growth hurdle for such startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mylk Guys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Food Delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: Undisclosed amount from YC and 4 other seed-round investors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Gaurav Maken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mylk Guys aspired to become the Amazon for vegan products. The officially stated reason for their failure was that the very thin margins in the food and beverage market didn’t mesh well with the high logistics costs of shipping throughout the US. The company is unlikely to be financially successful unless it reaches amazing economies of scale. If it isn’t growing fast enough to suggest it will reach sufficient size in reasonable time, it’s not a surprise the business closed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Magic Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: Consumer Electronics, Music, Mobile Apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: $2M, +&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mi-guitar-by-magic-instruments#/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crowdfunding campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founders: Andrew Song, Brian Fan, Mark Liebman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Instruments was developing a redesign of the guitar which replaces strings with the goal of making the instrument more easily accessible. Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11459076/magic-instruments-rhythm-guitar-announced-indiegogo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doubts about product-market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fit, the company ran a relatively successful IndieGoGo campaign and was seeing demand for their product. Nonetheless, after pre-purchasing, their customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/music-instrument-store/magic-instruments-1116-879379/complaints&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;didn’t receive the product for years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and eventually stopped receiving communication by Magic Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact reason for MI’s failure to deliver is unknown, but it’s not an uncommon situation for crowdfunded hardware products. Developing a proof of concept prototype is one thing, manufacturing in scale is a totally different beast and many inexperienced startups fail to tackle this issue because of one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plurchase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul role=&quot;list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry: E-Commerce, Social Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding: seed by YC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurchase tried to turn online shopping into a social experience by integrating social features into existing online stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface level, this seems like a very reasonable goal. A social layer would add value to online shopping, and other industries have been successful at adding such a social layer to their online experience. For example, live chat, donations, friend lists, and other social features have enabled twitch.tv to make watching someone else play a video game from your home an easily shareable experience - with your friends or other members of the video games community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, every attempt to tackle the same problem for e-commerce has been unsuccessful, and Plurchase is definitely not the only startup that has tried to make e-commerce social from one angle or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this seems like a logical problem to solve, it might just be the case that it is a problem not enough people have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository</title>
<link>https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git scraping&lt;/strong&gt; is the name I’ve given a scraping technique that I’ve been experimenting with for a few years now. It’s really effective, and more people should use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is full of interesting data that changes over time. These changes can sometimes be more interesting than the underlying static data—The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt_diff&quot;&gt;@nyt_diff Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; tracks changes made to New York Times headlines for example, which offers a fascinating insight into that publication’s editorial process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a great tool for efficiently tracking changes to text over time: &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; (and other CI systems) make it easy to create a scraper that runs every few minutes, records the current state of a resource and records changes to that resource over time in the commit history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a recent example. Fires continue to rage in California, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fire.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;CAL FIRE website&lt;/a&gt; offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/&quot;&gt;incident map&lt;/a&gt; showing the latest fire activity around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing up the Firefox Network pane, filtering to requests triggered by XHR and sorting by size, largest first reveals this endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents&quot;&gt;https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a 241KB JSON endpoints with full details of the various fires around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... I started running a git scraper against it. My scraper lives in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history&quot;&gt;simonw/ca-fires-history&lt;/a&gt; repository on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 20 minutes it grabs the latest copy of that JSON endpoint, pretty-prints it (for diff readability) using &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; and commits it back to the repo if it has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means I now have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commits/main&quot;&gt;commit log&lt;/a&gt; of changes to that information about fires in California. Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commit/7b0f42d4bf198885ab2b41a22a8da47157572d18&quot;&gt;example commit&lt;/a&gt; showing that last night the Zogg Fires percentage contained increased from 90% to 92%, the number of personnel involved dropped from 968 to 798 and the number of engines responding dropped from 82 to 59.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of a diff against the Zogg Fires, showing personnel involved dropping from 968 to 798, engines dropping 82 to 59, water tenders dropping 31 to 27 and percent contained increasing from 90 to 92.&quot; src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2020/git-scraping.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the scraper is entirely contained in a single GitHub Actions workflow. It’s in a file called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml&quot;&gt;.github/workflows/scrape.yml&lt;/a&gt; which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;Scrape latest data&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;:  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;6,26,46 * * * *&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;scheduled&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;Check out this repo&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;actions/checkout@v2&lt;/span&gt;
    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;Fetch latest data&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;|-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents | jq . &amp;gt; incidents.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    - &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;Commit and push if it changed&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;|-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        git config user.name &quot;Automated&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        git config user.email &quot;actions@users.noreply.github.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        git add -A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        timestamp=$(date -u)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        git commit -m &quot;Latest data: ${timestamp}&quot; || exit 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        git push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a lot of code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs on a schedule at 6, 26 and 46 minutes past the hour—I like to offset my cron times like this since I assume that the majority of crons run exactly on the hour, so running not-on-the-hour feels polite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scraper itself works by fetching the JSON using &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, piping it through &lt;code&gt;jq .&lt;/code&gt; to pretty-print it and saving the result to &lt;code&gt;incidents.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “commit and push if it changed” block uses a pattern that commits and pushes only if the file has changed. I wrote about this pattern in &lt;a href=&quot;https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/github-actions_commit-if-file-changed.md&quot;&gt;this TIL&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a whole bunch of repositories running git scrapers now. I’ve been labeling them with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/topics/git-scraping&quot;&gt;git-scraping topic&lt;/a&gt; so they show up in one place on GitHub (other people have started using that topic as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about some of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/gitscraping/&quot;&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that by giving this technique a name I can encourage more people to add it to their toolbox. It’s an extremely effective way of turning all sorts of interesting data sources into a changelog over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24732943&quot;&gt;Comment thread&lt;/a&gt; on this post over on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>If pay had kept pace with productivity gains, minimum wage would be $24 an hour</title>
<link>https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24</link>

<description>&lt;meta itemprop=&quot;image&quot; content=&quot;https://www.commondreams.org/sites/default/files/views-article/thumbs/weareworthmore.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta itemprop=&quot;wordCount&quot; content=&quot;812&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12 an hour today, more than 65 percent higher than the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While this would make a huge difference in the lives of many people earning close to the national minimum wage, it is actually a relatively unambitious target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 1968, the minimum wage not only kept pace with inflation, it rose in step with productivity growth. The logic is straightforward; we expect that wages in general will rise in step with productivity growth. For workers at the bottom to share in the overall improvement in society’s living standards, the minimum wage should also rise with productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important distinction. If the minimum wage rises in step with inflation, we are effectively ensuring that it will allow minimum wage earners to buy the same amount of goods and services through time, protecting them against higher prices. However, if it rises with productivity that means that as workers are able to produce more goods and services per hour, on average, minimum wage earners will be able to buy more goods and services through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the national minimum wage did rise roughly in step with productivity growth from its inception in 1938 until 1968, in the more than five decades since then, it has not even kept pace with inflation. However, if the minimum wage did rise in step with productivity growth since 1968 it would be over $24 an hour today, as shown in the Figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tableauPlaceholder&quot; id=&quot;viz1579628174592&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/this-is-what-minimum-wage-would-be-if-it-kept-pace-with-productivity&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; &quot; src=&quot;https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Tr/TrendsintheMinimumWage/Graph/1_rss.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth considering what the world would look like if this were the case. A minimum wage of $24 an hour would mean that a full-time full year minimum wage worker would be earning $48,000 a year. A two minimum wage earning couple would have a family income of $96,000 a year, enough to put them in the top quintile of the current income distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting the standard counter to the argument that the minimum wage should keep pace with productivity growth. It would be claimed that the productivity of minimum wage workers has not kept pace with average productivity growth, so that it would not be feasible for minimum wage workers to earn pay that rises in step with average productivity growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some truth to this claim, but only at a superficial level. The productivity of any individual worker is determined not just by their skills and technology, but also by the institutional structure we put in place. In a world without patent and copyright monopolies, the skills of bio-technicians and software designers would likely be much less valuable than they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the skills of experts in stock trading and designing complex financial instruments would have much less value if we had a financial transactions tax in place and allowed large banks to fail when their mistakes made them insolvent. And, the skills of doctors and other highly paid professionals would have much less value if our trade policy was as committed to subjecting them to international competition, as has been the case with auto and textile workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower pay for those at the top increases the real pay for those at the bottom and middle. A $15 an hour wage goes much further when all drugs are selling as low costs generics, the financial sector is not sucking 2 percent of GDP ($230 billion a year) out of the economy, and doctors get paid the same as their West European counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the productivity of less-skilled workers has not kept pace with average productivity, this was by design. It was not the fault of these workers; it was the fault of those who designed policies that had the effect of devaluing their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This raises a final point: we can’t imagine that we can just raise the minimum wage to $24 an hour without serious disruptions to the economy, many of which would have bad effects (i.e., unemployment) for those at the bottom. While there is certainly room to raise the minimum wage, and many states have done so with no measureable impact on employment, there clearly is a limit to how far and how fast we can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite reasonable to have a target where the minimum wage returns to where it would be, if it had tracked productivity growth over the last 50 years. But we will have to reverse many of the institutional changes that have been put in place over this period to get there. This is where the sort of policies described in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deanbaker.net/books/rigged.htm&quot;&gt;Rigged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (it’s free) come in, but that is a much longer story.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>If Worker Pay Had Kept Pace With Productivity Gains Since 1968, Today's Minimum Wage Would Be $24 an Hour</og:title>
<og:url>https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24</og:url>
<og:description>In such a world, a full-time minimum wage worker would be earning $48,000 a year in the United States... If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12 an hour today, more than 65 percent higher than the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While this would make a huge difference in the lives of many people earning close to the national minimum wage, it is actually a relatively unambitious target.</og:description>

<title>“35-50% of clicks on Reddit Ads are fraudulent”</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/comments/ikfmln/3550_of_clicks_on_reddit_ads_are_fraudulent/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/redditads/comments/ikfmln/3550_of_clicks_on_reddit_ads_are_fraudulent/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;We do a very simple check on each click we receive from Reddit Ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP&quot; readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does it load a background image, CSS or JS file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Does it follow a redirect (non-JS)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Did this IP/browser click in the past 24 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;This challenge page is permanently cached using Cloudflare in every POP, which means that it loads within 50 ms everywhere, making the odds of someone clicking away before the page loads very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Using these simple criteria, we've established that around 35-50% of the clicks we get charged for being fraudulent. Here are some monthly totals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;August 2020 - 395 clicks charged - 199 valid clicks (50% click fraud)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;July 2020 - 572 clicks charged - 277 valid clicks (52% click fraud)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;June 2020 - 599 clicks charged - 349 valid clicks (41% click fraud)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;The Reddit Ads support team provided me with an excel sheet of clicks they actually charged for and I confirmed that the fraudulent clicks I detected were actually charged for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here is an example of an IP address that was charged 15 times for 15 fraudulent clicks (this IP never loaded a single image/CSS/JS file), and on top of that, most of the clicks are within a 7-8 minute time window, all of them got charged regardless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://0bin.net/paste/wU1yV-TS#tpMXSywSKH0DL9EXxYfmGH7uFbutV4xJRcyl06x1LoO&quot; class=&quot;_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow ugc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://0bin.net/paste/wU1yV-TS#tpMXSywSKH0DL9EXxYfmGH7uFbutV4xJRcyl06x1LoO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Now, let me be clear, I'm aware that click fraud is impossible to completely prevent and there will always be a certain percentage of fraudulent clicks that we get charged for, but Reddit Ads doesn't seem to do the very basics of preventing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;_1eJr7K139jnMstd4HajqYP&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Don't charge the same IP address more than once in a certain time period (e.g. 24 hours)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Use an interstitial page that redirects to the actual page that charges the click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Make sure a visitor is legitimate by making sure they load an image/JS/CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;And when you do report it, even with something as blatant as the example I provided before, they are not willing to admit the issue nor are they willing to apply a partial refund or credit as compensation. Since they are not willing to do anything about it, the least I could do is warn other advertisers by writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have an EB-1A (extraordinary ability). I can try to help you if you give me some details. Like, why do you want to pursue the EB-1 route ? I ask because, the way you've phrased the question &quot;satisfy the requirements of EB-1&quot;, I don't think you fully understand what it entails. Its not like a driver's license you apply at the local DMV - I know how to drive, now give me the license! Its more like - you are making a formal request to the US government. You are then furnishing a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of documents as proof of your abilities. Even after all that, it's still their call. If they turn you down, that's fully within their right. And they can always do that - it is their country after all. I was always prepared to return to India if they rejected my application. If they approve, its your privilege. The way I view it - I took a shot &amp;amp; the ball went thru the hoop. Doesn't mean everytime I take a shot it will do that. Doesn't mean if somebody else takes a shot &amp;amp; it doesn't go thru the hoop, they are a worse player. afaik, there is no rule in the constitution that says you have satisfied all the requirements of EB1 so you must get EB1. At best, you can apply, but not appeal.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;24732280&quot; readability=&quot;5.6461916461916&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The EB1A (extraordinary ability) category has become incredibly tough (and much tougher than the O-1). Before doing anything, I would recommend that the individual get his or her background evaluated because it's a lot more and lot more nuanced than having patents or published papers or judging events. Just to avoid spending time on things that won't really lead to an approval.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;24734846&quot; readability=&quot;15.524752475248&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It can be very difficult to draw a through line or see a pattern in the EB1A adjudications. What's clear, however, is that it's a much higher standard than it used to be. It used to be similar to the O-1 standard but now USCIS wants to see a lot more than just meeting the required three criteria; it wants to see external/third-party evidence that the applicant is set apart from most of his or her peers through, for example, the purchase of a company founded by the applicant, the widespread use of a product developed by the applicant, the receipt of a major national or international award, publications with lots and lots of citations, extensive media coverage in major media, keynote/major invited conference speaking engagements, very high base and total compensation, etc.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; The EB-1 is a preference category for United States employment-based permanent residency. It is intended for &quot;priority workers&quot;. Those are foreign nationals who either have &quot;extraordinary abilities&quot;, or are &quot;outstanding professors or researchers&quot;, and also includes &quot;some executives and managers of foreign companies who are transferred to the US&quot;. It allows them to remain permanently in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; Therefore, applicants who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics through sustained national or international acclaim are not required to have a permanent offer of employment in the US and are eligible to self-petition, however, they must intend to work in the US in their field of expertise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think a sustainable way is to have professors and universities collaborate with H1B employees directly, to allow for them to publish papers and get in via the EB1 route. It won't work for every one, but could work for some and improve their situation and free up the Eb2/3 queues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;We already have grants from the industry to universities to do research. Is there something like this out there for immigrants like us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The time zone difference makes things harder, but we work well together. The cultural issues are greatly lessened by the fact that a number of people on the US side of the divide are from India, and I (US-born white guy) have made five trips to India to get to know people there. We're able to hand off issues to each other and address customer issues quickly because someone is available around the clock. I've had to push back and limit meetings to keep from working all the time, but it's easy to get sucked into over-long hours.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are true, critical cultural differences between the US and say the middle east, or asia. In some cultures it is really bad to ask questions when something is unclear, it is really bad to take any sort of initiatives, it is really bad to push back on unreasonable requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;To me this is the true reason massive out-sourcing failed a few decades ago. It just requires a lot of work to adjust for these differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I understand some people might be offended by this but I am speaking unadulterated truth with absolutely no offense meant in terms of race/country/origin. The culture is totally different and IMO not conducive to innovation, critical thinking and constructive feedback - it is the opposite.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Still, some people will be offended by this. Are there exceptions? Absolutely. Is this a common pattern and generalization? Yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I've worked as an engineer on both sides you mention.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You get what you pay for, there are companies that charge you more and some that charge you less. There are companies that hire good talent, pay them well, have experienced engineers who have worked with range of people/projects and consequently are generally well travelled and culturally aware. And, there are companies that just hire inexperienced engineers etc. Irrespective of which country, if you want a good team of engineers, you got to be willing to pay more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And, while working with people from a different country/geography, instead of just expecting the people you work with to be culturally aware, you got to be willing to learn and get culturally aware too. Did you put in any effort? For instance, if you go in with I won't even care about trying to pronounce your name right or a bias that &quot;your culture is just not good for innovation/critical thinking etc&quot; attitude, you wont get anywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I will also add that it's kind of sad that you imply that people who just live according to their culture are &quot;less good&quot;, or &quot;cheaper&quot;, or &quot;less experienced&quot;. Price and cost have nothing to do with it. It is normal for people to live and behave the way they've been taught.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not sure how you got this from what I wrote. I was responding directly to -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;..The culture is totally different and IMO not conducive to innovation, critical thinking and constructive feedback - it is the opposite...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I was trying to say don't look down condescendingly on other cultures and expect to develop a great working relationship. Experience with different teams and people gives you cultural awareness, where you learn how to motivate, communicate with different people effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Anyway, all I can say is I have worked with multiple teams from different countries and cultures, and haven't had the challenging experience you mention. So, when you use your personal experience to make a generalized claim, I feel its inaccurate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, felt compelled to leave a comment. I am not looking to change your opinion though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm a startup founder from India who'd love to learn more about how to gain access to US capital markets and startup ecosystem. (e.g. Annual VC deal volume in US is typically 25x that of India).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'd love to know what you think are some practical ways of going about this, any common gotchas etc.:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. Opening a delaware c corp via stripe atlas, any common mistakes you've seen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2. For a small bootstrapped business (&amp;lt;$100K ARR), are there any realistic ways for the founder to immigrate to the US? (mainly to access a better ecosystem, community)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3. For setting up a remote team: Say that I keep the tech team in my home country, what's the best way to, for example, set up a sales team in the US? (common use case for B2B SaaS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Many thanks for doing this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My father filed for my GC in Nov 2017 when he was LPR and he got naturalized in Oct 2018. In previous AMA, you had kindly advised me that USCIS needs to be informed. I reached out to my immigration attorney and below is the response she sent →&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Per my last email to you back in November, nothing needs to be done at this time. Nothing will change the processing times, and we will just need to notify the NVC once the I-130 is approved, to update the category at that time, because USCIS requires these requests to be made in writing via letter, and they never actually act on the case anyways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will be fine, and once we get the I-130 approval is when we’ll take action on this.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I am unsure how should I take her advise. Is there something my attorney is missing? Is there something you can think of I should request her to do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, last time we had speculated that I may get my GC in 2022/23. Do you think the current pandemic may prolong my GC? My father said my file must be in &lt;em&gt;cold storage&lt;/em&gt; now, albeit I am not entirely sure what it means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;When you show up at a land border, you technically exit the US. Likewise, when CBSA turns you back, you'd be re-entering the US and going through US CBP. So for purposes of updating a US visas, the current ban is not relevant if you present at a land border.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;26.864729458918&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That's technically true, but in the future I believe it also means that you have officially been denied entry to Canada, which could come back to bite you in the future (as silly as it is).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It also runs the risk of Canada not letting you in and turning you back, and then the US not letting you in (if they decide your status, O-1 here but often would be TN, isn't valid, or for whatever other reason), and you.... get stuck in no-mans-land? I've always legitimately wondered what happens in that situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you do happen to be a citizen or permanent resident of either Canada or Mexico, it would be safest to do your border-trip at your home-country border.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;_Update_: Did some real quick research, and it appears that for US/Canada at least there are agreements in place that if one country rejects your entrance (at a land border) from the other country, the other country must take you back, but could find you inadmissible and put you in immigration custody pending removal. Fun times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm an Indian H1-B guy working on an MVP with a green card holder here in California. I'm working for an employer right now, but really willing to jump on my project full time if it shows promise. We're not going to make any income from it until we raise money from VC's so I assume it is safe to keep doing this?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, when the time comes, how do you suggest that I jump on it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are a few options I have:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Found a company but be a salaried person on payroll, along with a risk of being &quot;fireable&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- Go with &quot;Unshackled&quot;, who would take care of everything for me. Are there any drawbacks with this method that you foresee?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;- I also have an option to move on to H4 EAD, but I'm worried because of the flaky nature of this status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Can you provide some thoughts on these and weigh in on the different gotchas and pros/cons involved?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Broadly, there are two challenges: building a company without crossing the line into unauthorized employment and getting authorization to work for a company you founded/own. Beyond not getting paid, the line mentioned above is a grey and nuanced one; the very general rule of thumb is that its time to get work authorization when the side project is no longer a side project. The work authorization options are the H-4 EAD, as you note, which almost certainly will remain untouched if there's a change in administration, a concurrent part-time H-1B, which would allow you to continue working for your current H-1B employer, the O-1, a high standard but ownership and control are not really issues, and the H-1B, with ownership and control stumbling blocks.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you end up with a border officer who believes that your degree is not applicable, or your experience doesn't count, it is unlikely that you are going to be able to change their mind in that moment. NAFTA officers can be better (as the post writer above mentioned), but it still always feels like a bit of a toss-up of whether you get a &quot;good&quot; border agent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The decision to approve or deny is entirely in the hands of the officer, and I managed to get a NAFTA officer who interpreted the agreement in my favour. It's why so much time and effort goes into the supporting documents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Ie, if you are currently within the US on a TN, and looking to switch jobs, you can not file for a new status with USCIS; your options are either to leave the country and apply at a POE, or leave the country, and only then petition with USCIS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Is this incorrect? Can a current TN holder petition USCIS for a new TN while still within the US?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Do you think it is likely that the new H-1B rules will be struck down in court?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, I am currently on the OPT STEM extension, and will be putting in my third and final H-1B application in 2021. The new rules seem incredibly restrictive. My current salary puts me at the level 3 prevailing wage for software engineer in my area. The new rules would require a ~30% raise in order to qualify for the H-1B. Can my employer re-classify me to a level 1 prevailing wage worker before my H-1B application so that I can qualify? For context, I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from a US university in 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I ask, because I work for a startup that would struggle to justify such a large raise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm American but my co-founder is Canadian. We've looked at options under NAFTA / TN visa and others, but that doesn't seem to apply to startup founders. We're also flexible on structure, and leaning on an LLC taxed as S-Corp to make it easy for us for filing. We are a research-based startup and are planning to apply for NSF SBIRs (so we need to be 51% US-owned) and not necessarily raise money at the start. Do you have any thoughts on our case? Or do we need to go the H1-B route for her as a co-founder?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What is your advice on finding a good attorney in general (not just immigration one)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Go through an experienced attorney you trust. It's pretty easy for attorneys to find good attorneys even if outside their area of expertise.&lt;/span&gt;

Does it matter if the study happened in our outside of US? Thanks!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm graduating next spring with a B.S. in Physics/Computer Science and currently have work authorization through DACA. With the recent challenges the current administration have imposed on DACA it's not clear what will happen with DACA in the next year. Do you suggest I seek an employer that can sponsor for h1 visa? Are DACA recipients eligible for h1 visa? Are there other pathways you suggests I explore?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Thank you very much for doing this. I have permanent residency, and children younger than 21 who live abroad. If I were to apply for permanent residency for them, would they be able to visit the US as tourists while the process is ongoing, or come to study to an American university with a student visa?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The answer depends in part on whether they already have B-2 tourist visas. If they do, they should be able to visit you without issue. If they don't, they would need to apply for visas and that adds a layer of uncertainty - their visa applications could be denied. Between B-2 and F-1 visas, there's a greater likelihood that their F-1 visa applications would be denied. But, with some planning, you might be able to minimize these issues. If you'd like to discuss this, email me separately.&lt;/span&gt;

Our contract stated I would pay a flat fee and she would cover the filing fees. When we filed the first set of forms, she expected me to pay. When I pointed out the contract said she would pay, she crossed it out in pen, rewrote it in pen stating I would pay. I had already signed the document, and felt obligated to continue using her service since we were months into the process and I didn't want to lose the time invested. I felt like refusing, but didn't want her to intentionally drag out the process as retribution.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This was in 2017 and after 2 years my wife is now in the country. Is there any course of action I could take now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I understand that E-3 visas for Australians are easier to obtain than other types of visas. In your experience, does this mean startups will welcome applications from Australians where the job advert does not mention visa sponsorship?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. Can I re-enter the US in January 2021? (my visa doesn't expire till later that year and I plan to file an extension). 2. Can my company file a greencard application on my behalf as soon as I enter the US? (I have asked for it as a part of my compensation package and the company will likely agree).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Not a lawyer but having been there... please do this. That goes for anyone else reading this as well. There isn't really a waiting period as far as I am aware. Companies take their sweet time because there's no incentive to do otherwise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Even if you are not from the two backlogged countries, a successful application will most likely take years to complete. In the mean time, you would be dealing with the stress of the concurrent L1 or H1 extensions, which have become much harder lately, are RFE-prone and sometimes you get crappy 1 year extensions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Another thing to note, specifically for L1: you need to prove you have company-specific skills that can't be found elsewhere, which is why they need to transfer you. That's different from H1, where you need to prove you have skills that can't be easily found in the workforce, but they don't need any company-specific knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But, for the PERM process, you have to prove that you have skills that are difficult to find in the broader US labor pool - and generally, that you had those skills &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you were employed by the company (because, if you didn't have them, it means that they could hire a US worker without those skills and train them, just as they have 'trained' you). In fact, they will ask how long would it take to train a worker on your 'skill' level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So you can see how the two skill sets (for L1 and PERM) don't overlap and how complicated the application can get. Another reason why you should start early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

We've heard the current administration is rejecting applications for every little reason (e.g. field that should be marked n/a is left blank, etc). Do you have any advice on this? Thank you so much for what you do.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I personally had to talk to my manager and hire my own lawyer instead of working with Fragomen after countless delays and mistakes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You mentioned the prevailing wage update affects people renewing visas. Would you please be able to elaborate on that and the &quot;field of study&quot; change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1.) Is there a guide to figure out which level you fall under?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2.) Lets say based on my years of experience (4 years + MS), I qualify for level 4, does that mean if I don't have base salary of 217,000 in NYC, then I am not able to obtain a H1B?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3.) If you have a related degree like analytics or data science, are you eligible to work as software engineer or has that become invalid?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;4.) How long is this expected to run its course if no litigation or no other outside force provides adequate changes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For (4), I guess I am asking are these changes permanent? Or are they a temporary change (e.g. only valid until end of 2020 like the visa ban that the Trump admin had released earlier this year).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;EDIT: work directly to those companies (as a contractor or, if possible and viable, as an employee - with benefits), not through intermediaries or as a SW shop (B2B deal)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Can the AP be re-filed in this case? Are there additional fee for refiling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Any opinion on whether or not there will be a merit-based immigration category similar to one proposed by the RAISE act?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In the most basic terms, the problem is that some tax is withheld (i.e. paid to the tax agency by your employer in advance on your behalf), and that must be done in the appropriate country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have a Ph.D. (Elec. Eng.) from a non-U.S. university and have lived in the U.S. on a J-2 (dependent) visa; my spouse was working as a researcher at a U.S. university. During that time, I worked (on an EAD) for a U.S.-based R&amp;amp;D company, serving as a principal investigator on Govt. (DoD) funded research projects. I have publications, have served as reviewer for intl. academic journals, etc., but have not won any internationally recognized prizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(1) Given my background, do I currently stand a chance of getting an EB-2 visa via NIW?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(2) Would it all come down to the letters supporting my applications?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(3) Does my prior J-2 status (2-year home stay requirement; visa expired 1.5 years ago) have any effect on possibly getting an EB-2 visa via NIW?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(4) Would the prior J-1 status of my spouse affect her ability to join me on an E-21?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(5) Would applying to the Diversity Visa Program interfere with also applying for an EB-2 visa via NIW?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am not affiliated with them in any way. You will definitely need letters of recommendation but most importantly you will need to show that you are better than the majority of you peers. For example, you could show how well your work is cited compared to others in the same field. You being a P.I. on a federal grant is a huge plus and I think that already increases your chances significantly. As far as J visa situation goes, I think it's possible to get a waiver but I'm not a lawyer and I was on H1B when I applied so can't speak of it.&lt;/span&gt;

You can visit as a nonimmigrant according to the same visa requirements and procedures as someone else from your own country.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you want to become a citizen again, you will first have to find a way to get an immigrant visa or come on a dual-intent route like H1-B. Then live here for five years and apply to naturalize same as anyone else. The good news is even if you moved to a country like China or India with extra wait times for visas, it won't affect you since you were not born there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There are a few statues that disqualify renouncees from certain benefits such as owning a gun, IDK if you can ever get those back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm a Master's student on an F-1 visa thinking about starting a company in the US. I previously did my undergraduate degree here as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2. Is there a way to use the STEM extension if you are self-employed? I've seen contradictory information on this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3. If the answer to 2. is No, what would be the best visa to try to transition to after the first 12 months of OPT? O-1, E-1, or H1-B? Or something else entirely?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Do you have any advice for what folks should be looking for when choosing an immigration attorney? Are there any reputable lists you could recommend?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Now, for my question: Is a nonimmigrant considered to be &quot;out of status&quot; between steps (3) and (4) in the following timeline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. Arrive to the US with B-2 Visa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2. Apply for F-1 Visa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3. B-2 Visa expires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;4. F-1 Visa granted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Additionally, is this considered a violation of the terms or conditions of their nonimmigrant status? From my understanding, they are in a &quot;period of authorized stay&quot; during this time, but I am curious about what this means in terms of status and potential violations of their status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;i am not a lawyer but have moved from the UK to the USA. The visa is permission to cross the border, but there's the i-94 stamp which is visitor residency, so if your visa expires but you are still good with i-94 dates, you're fine i believe (just you can't return if you leave). Obviously it's more complicated, i had a different visa to the one you mention.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm a Software Engineer at a finance company. My company is currently filing for my Green Card and we're at Step 1 (Prevailing Wage Determination) of the process. Considering the rule change announced by administration yesterday, I'm not sure if my base salary will satisfy higher percentile requirement for my level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My Question is :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1) Do these changes apply for PERM filings?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2) If base salary doesn't meet requirement, can PERM filing happen at different level even though H1B was approved at higher level (ex : level 3 approval on H1B, level 2 filing for PERM)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have an I-485 portability rule question. I know the official minimum for an I-485 pending application to be portable is 180 days, but I was wondering, if there is a way for people losing their jobs before the 180 days are up, to keep the application, employment authorization (EAD), and Advance Parole pending and and port over to the next employer past the 180 days (not all of them spent with the petitioning employer)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You just need to address non-resident taxation here in the US. I would suggest talking to a tax attorney or professional to double check, but normally, compensation for personal services physically performed in the foreign country is not considered US-source income. Same as if you hired him to go take some product photos in Columbia or do door to door sales or anything else. If that is the case in your scenario, this would be really easy and you would have virtually no paperwork or witholding requirements.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, it may be a lot cheaper to have an initial checkup with a tax specialist and then skip the ongoing expense of having a &quot;proxy&quot; company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I just got my H1B approval after being on OPT for the last couple years. Apart from obvious covid restrictions, am I otherwise still limited for travel because of the recent executive orders? Do you know when it will be possible to leave and re-enter the US?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also, now that remote work is common, I am curious if the H1B has requirements for time spent in the US, the way the green card does. I can't seem to find definitive answers about any residency requirements online. Are there any for H1B?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ProtonMail CEO calls Apple&amp;#039;s forced in-app purchases &amp;#039;Mafia extortion&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.techspot.com/news/87043-protonmail-ceo-calls-apple-forced-app-purchases-mafia.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techspot.com/news/87043-protonmail-ceo-calls-apple-forced-app-purchases-mafia.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Encrypted email provider ProtonMail says that Apple forced it to monetize its app, which was on the App Store for more than two years without in-app purchases. It also claims that when it tried to inform its customers of the sudden change, Apple blocked it from posting app updates and threatened to remove it from the store.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has been facing a lot of heat lately regarding its walled garden policies. This week the stove got turned up another notch. Not only did a former App Store exec &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/news/87038-former-app-store-exec-testifies-apple-rules-weapon.html&quot;&gt;accuse&lt;/a&gt; the company of using its rules as &quot;weapons&quot; against competitors, but a developer also claims that it was forced to add in-app purchases to its app when it had been free for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail's CEO Andy Yen says that his company is not the only one to suffer Apple's &quot;strong-armed&quot; tactics, but others have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap&quot;&gt;afraid&lt;/a&gt; to speak out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a lot of fear in the space right now; people are completely petrified to say anything,&quot; Yen told The Verge on Thursday. &quot;For the first two years we were in the App Store, that was fine, no issues there. But a common practice we see ... as you start getting significant uptake in uploads and downloads ... then as any good Mafia extortion goes, they come to shake you down for some money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1280&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2016%209'%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2020/10/2020-10-08-image-38.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shakedown came in 2018, according to Yen. Up until that point, the app was completely free. It wasn't a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/news/86371-apple-removes-fortnite-app-store-over-epic-alternative.html&quot;&gt;situation&lt;/a&gt; like what is going on between Apple and Epic right now, he insists. Unlike Fortnite, the app never had any in-app purchase whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of the blue, one day they said you have to add in-app purchase to stay in the App Store. They stumbled upon something in the app that mentioned there were paid plans, they went to the website and saw there was a subscription you could purchase, and then turned around and demanded we add IAP. There's nothing you can say to that. They are judge, jury, and executioner on their platform, and you can take it or leave it. You can't get any sort of fair hearing to determine whether it's justifiable or not justifiable, anything they say goes. We simply complied in order to save our business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yen says the company was forced to raise its prices since the 30-percent commission that Apple takes completely ate away ProtonMail's profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1707&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2016%209'%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2020/10/2020-10-08-image-39.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple responded, saying that free companion apps to paid online services are no longer required to have in-app purchases as of September 11, 2020. As long as paid upgrades are not offered through the app and it has no notifications to customers about an external subscription service, everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Yen was told of this, he said that he would definitely try taking out in-app purchases from ProtonMail, but not before first testing the policy using the company's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/news/83370-protonmail-pushes-protoncalendar-beta.html&quot;&gt;upcoming&lt;/a&gt; ProtonDrive app. He says he does not trust Apple's rules enough, and how it enforces them, to risk the already-establish email app, which Apple previously leveraged with update blocking and threats of removal to force the in-app purchases in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that ProtonMail is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/news/86882-apple-critics-epic-spotify-others-form-coalition-fight.html&quot;&gt;founding&lt;/a&gt; members of the Coalition for App Fairness. It, along with various partners, including Microsoft, Epic Games, Spotify, and others, are looking to level the competitive playing field regarding in-app purchases, fees, and anti-competitive policies. Apple has been the Coalition's primary target, but it has criticized Google as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Memory safe ‘curl’ for a more secure internet</title>
<link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/09/rust-in-curl-with-hyper/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/09/rust-in-curl-with-hyper/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tldr: work has started to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyper.rs/&quot;&gt;Hyper&lt;/a&gt; work as a backend in curl for HTTP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl and its data transfer core, libcurl, is all written in C. The language C is known and infamous for not being memory safe and for being easy to mess up and as a result accidentally cause security problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, C compilers are very widely used and available and you can compile C programs for virtually every operating system and CPU out there. A C program can be made far more portable than code written in just about any other programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl is a piece of “insecure” C code installed in some ten billion installations world-wide. I’m saying insecure within quotes because I don’t think curl is insecure. We have our share of security vulnerabilities of course, even if I think the rate of them getting found has been drastically reduced over the last few years, but we have never had a critical one and with the help of busloads of tools and humans we find and fix most issues in the code before they ever land in the hands of users. (And “memory safety” is not the single explanation for getting security issues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that curl and libcurl will remain in wide use for a long time ahead: curl is an established component and companion in scripts and setups everywhere. libcurl is almost a de facto standard in places for doing internet transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rewrite of curl to another language is not considered. Porting an old, established and well-used code base such as libcurl, which to a far degree has gained its popularity and spread due to a stable API, not breaking the ABI and not changing behavior of existing functionality, is a massive and daunting task. To the degree that so far it hasn’t been attempted seriously and even giant corporations who have considered it, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/&quot; data-type=&quot;post&quot; data-id=&quot;12576&quot;&gt;backpedaled such ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change, but not change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preface above might make it seem like we’re stuck with exactly what we have for as long as curl and libcurl are used. But fear not: things are more complicated, or perhaps brighter, than it first seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s important to users of libcurl needs to be kept intact. We keep the API, the ABI, the behavior and all the documented options and features remain. We also need to continuously add stuff and keep up with the world going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can change the internals! &lt;em&gt;Refactor&lt;/em&gt; as the kids say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backends, backends, backends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already today, you can build libcurl to use different “backends” for TLS, SSH, name resolving, LDAP, IDN, GSSAPI and HTTP/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “backend” in this context is a piece of code in curl that lets you use a particular solution, often involving a specific third party library, for a certain libcurl functionality. Using this setup you can, for example, opt to build libcurl with one or more out of &lt;em&gt;thirteen&lt;/em&gt; different TLS libraries. You simply pick the one(s) you prefer when you build it. The libcurl API remains the same to users, it’s just that some features and functionality might differ a bit. The number of TLS backends is of course also fluid over time as we add support for more libraries in the future, or even drop support for old ones as they fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building curl, you can right now make it use up to &lt;strong&gt;33&lt;/strong&gt; different third party libraries for different functions. Many of them of course mutually exclusive, so no single build can use all 33.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said differently: you can improve your curl and libcurl binaries without changing any code, by simply rebuilding it to use another backend combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-1200x675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14819&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-450x253.jpg 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-200x113.jpg 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-768x432.jpg 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/curl-third-party-world-map.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Green boxes are possible third-party dependencies curl can be told to use. No Hyper in this map yet…
&lt;h2&gt;libcurl as a glorified switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an extensive set of backends that use third party libraries, the job of libcurl to a large extent becomes to act as a switch between the provided stable external API and the particular third party library that does the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; glue code in C &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; backend library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;libcurl as the rock, with a door and the entry rules written in stone. The backends can come and go, change and improve, but the applications outside the entrance won’t notice that. They get a stable API and ABI that they know and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safe backends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup provides a foundation and infrastructure to offer backends written in other languages as part of the package. As long as those libraries have APIs that are accessible to libcurl, libraries used by the backends can be written in any language – but since we’re talking about memory safety in this blog post the most obvious choices would probably be one of the modern and safe languages. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14823&quot; width=&quot;204&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png 500w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-200x200.png 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a backend library written in Rust , libcurl would lean on such a component to do low level protocol work and presumably, by doing this it increases the chances of the implementations to be safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the already supported third party libraries in the world map image above are written in Rust: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche&quot;&gt;quiche&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mesalink.io/&quot;&gt;Mesalink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hyper as a backend for HTTP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hyper.rs/&quot;&gt;Hyper&lt;/a&gt; is a HTTP library written in Rust. It is meant to be fast, accurate and safe, and it supports both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14753&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png 640w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-200x200.png 200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another step into this world of an ever-growing number of backends to libcurl, work has begun to make sure curl (&lt;em&gt;optionally&lt;/em&gt;) can get built to use Hyper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is gracefully funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abetterinternet.org/&quot;&gt;ISRG&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps mostly known as the organization behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Many challenges remain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize that this is early days. We know what we want to do, we know basically how to do it but from there to actually getting it done and providing it in source code to the world is &lt;em&gt;a little bit of work&lt;/em&gt; that hasn’t been done. I’m set out to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyper didn’t have a C API, they’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2278&quot;&gt;working on making one&lt;/a&gt; so that C based applications such as curl can actually use it. I do my best at providing feedback from my point of view, but as I’m not really into Rust much I can’t assist much with the implementation parts there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there’s an early/alpha version of the API to try out, I will first make sure curl can get built to use Hyper, and then start poking on the code to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that work I expect me to have to go back to the API with questions, feedback and perhaps documentation suggestions. I also anticipate challenges in switching libcurl internals to using this. Mostly small ones, but possibly also larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a git branch and make my work on this public and accessible early on to let everyone who wants to, to keep up with the development. A first milestone will be the ability to run a single curl test case (any test case) successfully – unmodified. The branch is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper&quot;&gt;https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper&lt;/a&gt; – beware that it will be rebased frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no deadline for this project and I don’t yet have any guesses as when there will be anything to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rust itself is not there yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is truly ground work for future developers to build upon as some of the issues dealt with in here should benefit others as well down the road. For example it immediately became obvious that Rust in general encourages to &lt;em&gt;abort&lt;/em&gt; on out-of-memory issues, while this is a big &lt;em&gt;nono&lt;/em&gt; when the code is used in a system library (such as curl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit vague on the details here because it’s not my expertise, but Rust itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2265#issuecomment-696915382&quot;&gt;can’t even properly clean up its memory&lt;/a&gt; and just returns error when it hits such a condition. Clearly something to fix before a libcurl with hyper could claim identical behavior and never to leak memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;By default?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Hyper be used by default in a future curl build near you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to work on the project to make that future &lt;em&gt;a possibility&lt;/em&gt; with the mindset that it could benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; it truly happens involve many different factors (for example maturity, feature set, memory footprint, performance, portability and on-disk footprint…) and in particular it will depend a lot on the people that build and ship the curl packages you use – which isn’t the curl project itself as we only ship source code. I’m thinking of Linux and operating system distributions etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; it might happen we can’t tell yet as we’re still much too early in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still a lot of C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not converting curl to Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be fooled into believing that we are getting rid of C in curl by taking this step.&lt;/strong&gt; With the introduction of a Hyper powered backend, we will certainly reduce the share of C code that is executed in a typical HTTP transfer by a measurable amount (for those builds), but curl is much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even a given that the Hyper backend will “win” the competition for users against the C implementation on the platforms you care about. The future is not set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More backends in safe languages?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, why not? There are efforts to provide more backends written in Rust. Gradually, we might move into a future where less and less of the final curl and libcurl executable code was compiled from C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How and if that will happen will of course depend on a lot of factors – in particular funding of the necessary work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we drive the development in this direction even further? I think it is much too early to speculate on that. Let’s first see how these first few episodes into the coming decades turn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ain't no party like a programming language virtual conference party&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running into a lot of happy and excited scientists lately. “Running into” in the virtual sense, of course, as conferences and other opportunities to collide with scientists in meatspace have been all but eliminated. Most scientists believe in the germ theory of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these scientists and mathematicians are excited about a new tool. It’s not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01866-9&quot;&gt;new particle&lt;/a&gt; accelerator nor a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/japans-fugaku-supercomputer-is-first-in-the-world-to-simultaneously-top-all-high-performance-benchmarks&quot;&gt;supercomputer&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, this exciting new tool for scientific research is... a computer language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can a computer language be exciting, you ask? Surely, some are better than others, depending on your purposes and priorities. Some run faster, while others are quicker and easier to develop in. Some have a larger ecosystem, allowing you to borrow battle-tested code from a library and do less of the work yourself. Some are well-suited to particular types of problems, while others are good at being general-purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For scientists who compute, languages, the quality of compilers and libraries, and, of course, the machines they run on, have always been important. For those whose job it is to simulate the atmosphere, or design nuclear weapons, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/scientific-computings-future-can-any-coding-language-top-a-1950s-behemoth/&quot;&gt;Fortran&lt;/a&gt; was the traditional tool of choice (and still often is, although it has more competition now). That language has dominated the market because compilers are available that can take good advantage of the largest supercomputers. For the current breed of data scientists, Python is currently popular because of the momentum of its ecosystem and its interactivity and rapid development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/scientific-computings-future-can-any-coding-language-top-a-1950s-behemoth/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in these pages about the enduring prominence of Fortran for scientific computing and compared it with several other languages. I ended that article with a prediction that, in 10 years, a new language called Julia stood a good chance of becoming the one that scientists would turn to when tackling large-scale numerical problems. My prediction was not very accurate, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually only took Julia about &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough excitement for a Con&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with scientists in recent years, the computer language Julia has genuinely created a new wave of enthusiasm in the industry. But back when I wrote about its potential, I did not understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the language would take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I based my assessment on Julia’s unique combination of convenient syntax with uncompromising performance. At the time, although Julia was still in pre-1.0 status, there was already plenty of excited chatter. Julia seemed to have solved the “two-language problem”—a conundrum often facing Python programmers, as well as users of other expressive, interpreted languages. You write a program to solve a problem in Python, enjoying its pleasant syntax and interactivity. The program works on a test version of your problem, but when you try to scale it up to something more realistic, it’s too slow. This is not your fault. Python is inherently slow—something that doesn’t matter for some types of applications but does matter for your big simulation. After applying various techniques to speed it up but only realizing modest gains, you finally resort to rewriting the most time-consuming parts of the calculation in C (most commonly). Now it’s fast enough, but now you also need to maintain code in both languages, hence the two-language problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Julia’s solution to this problem attracted scientists and others to the language, this is not the reason for the newfound excitement around the platform. There is something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-7.06.52-PM.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;388&quot; data-width=&quot;1290&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; The banner for JuliaCon 2020&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was working on this article, this year’s JuliaCon, the annual Julia convention, took place (online, of course). Usually the schedule for a computer meeting is filled with titles about things related to programming, compilers, algorithms, optimization, and other computer sciencey subjects. And while there was plenty of that at this year’s Julia meetup, skimming through the titles leaves the impression that one has stumbled into a science conference. There are presentations on everything from fluid dynamics to brain imaging to language processing. Despite the stunning variety of fields, however, watching the presentations gives a sense of community around a shared attitude that seems to have been influenced by the free software movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone’s &lt;/em&gt;code is on GitHub. If you are interested in using someone’s algorithm in your research, you can read the source, and you will have access to the latest version as it is developed. Scientists of a certain age will know how vastly different this is from how computational research used to proceed. In the old days, code rarely left the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Julia community is unified by something else, as well: a shared delight in the magical (this word cropped up more than once) power of Julia to facilitate collaboration and code reuse. Consider just some of the praise coming from JuliaCon 2020 presenters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the things that makes Julia so powerful in the solution of these problems […] This integration gives Julia an advantage over other languages […] we have been able to develop these solutions in a very short period of time:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkkqdr2vmZ4&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=25&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;León Alday, molecular modeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia is really the language that allows such a project to exist:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKATlEAu8eE&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=37&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;George Datseris, Dr. Watson, a scientific assistant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia is a joy to program in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcsbNhJ7DY&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=58&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mauro Werder, Glacier ice thickness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Julia language […] is a particularly agile tool:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUmd-J0CaNs&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=65&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valeri Vasquez, Disease vector dynamics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia was the obvious choice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDvhIASXb6k&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=80&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rafael Schouten, Spatial simulations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Julia allows] me to harness tools from across disciplines to advance cancer research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOw9VrLmZzs&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=83&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meghan Ferrall-Fairbanks, Tumor dynamics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has been very nice to do in Julia because of the nice abstractions that allow very general code:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayidyW0ybj0&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=113&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vilim Štih, Zebrafish brain dynamics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really nice to have a fast language that can be used to write everything. […] but what really impresses me these days is something else—Julia is somehow able to increase my productivity […]. Julia makes it easy to think at the right level of abstraction.”:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKHdbfxCV44&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=130&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Petr Krysl, Partial differential equations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doing science in Julia is awesome […] Inter-package interaction = pure magic!:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6jSYJQSq5I&amp;amp;list=PLP8iPy9hna6Tl2UHTrm4jnIYrLkIcAROR&amp;amp;index=133&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;George Datseris Analysis of music performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientists have all discovered that Julia boosts the opportunities for collaboration and makes it easier than ever before to incorporate the work of others and to allow them to write code that can be used &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;others in unforeseen ways. The key to these powers is in Julia’s solution to a different old conundrum, this time from computer science—the &lt;em&gt;expression problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft is letting employees work from home permanently</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;NtIBhS&quot;&gt;Microsoft is allowing more of its employees to work from home permanently, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/&quot;&gt;announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. While the vast majority of Microsoft employees are still working from home during the ongoing pandemic, the software maker has unveiled “hybrid workplace” guidance internally to allow for far greater flexibility once US offices eventually reopen. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has received Microsoft’s internal guidance, and it outlines the company’s flexible working plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dPOeON&quot;&gt;Microsoft will now allow employees to work from home freely for less than 50 percent of their working week, or for managers to approve permanent remote work. Employees who opt for the permanent remote work option will give up their assigned office space, but still have options to use touchdown space available at Microsoft’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fj1AWv&quot;&gt;“The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us to think, live, and work in new ways,” says Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief people officer, in a note to employees. “We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual workstyles, while balancing business needs, and ensuring we live our culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sXtx2U&quot;&gt;While most employees will be able to easily take advantage of the less than 50 percent working from home option, some roles will be difficult, or even impossible, to permanently transition to remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;Y7H9nU&quot;&gt;Microsoft highlights a few roles that still require access to the company’s offices, including those that require access to hardware labs, data centers, and in-person training. Employees will also be allowed to relocate domestically with approval, or even seek to move internationally if remote working is viable for their particular role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aKcFUI&quot;&gt;While Microsoft employees will be allowed to move across country for remote work, compensation and benefits will change and vary depending on the company’s own geopay scale. Microsoft will be covering home office expenses for permanent remote workers, but any that decide to move away from Microsoft’s offices will need to cover their own relocation costs. Flexible working hours will also be available without manager approval, and employees can also request part-time work hours through their managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pZwx0r&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s move to more flexible working comes months after the company notified employees that its US offices &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349969/microsoft-offices-reopen-january-2021-workplace-dial&quot;&gt;wouldn’t reopen until January 2021 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164522/microsoft-coronavirus-response-comment-employees-memo-work-from-home&quot;&gt;allowed its employees to work from home back in March&lt;/a&gt; before enforcing a mandatory work from home policy as the pandemic spread across Seattle and further into the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uFnjBH&quot;&gt;Microsoft isn’t alone in allowing employees to permanently work remotely. Facebook is shifting tens of thousand of jobs to remote work, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview&quot;&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to The Verge&lt;/a&gt; that up to half of employees could work remotely within five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the Arabic world turned away from science (2011)</title>
<link>http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ontemporary Islam is not known for its engagement in the modern scientific project. But it is heir to a legendary “Golden Age” of Arabic science frequently invoked by commentators hoping to make Muslims and Westerners more respectful and understanding of each other. President Obama, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-cairo-university-6-04-09&quot;&gt;in his June 4, 2009 speech in Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, praised Muslims for their historical scientific and intellectual contributions to civilization:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Islam that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe’s Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Such tributes to the Arab world’s era of scientific achievement are generally made in service of a broader political point, as they usually precede discussion of the region’s contemporary problems. They serve as an implicit exhortation: the great age of Arab science demonstrates that there is no categorical or congenital barrier to tolerance, cosmopolitanism, and advancement in the Islamic Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone familiar with this Golden Age, roughly spanning the eighth through the thirteenth centuries &lt;span&gt;a.d.&lt;/span&gt;, the disparity between the intellectual achievements of the Middle East then and now — particularly relative to the rest of the world — is staggering indeed. In his 2002 book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060516054?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060516054&quot;&gt;What Went Wrong?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, historian Bernard Lewis notes that “for many centuries the world of Islam was in the forefront of human civilization and achievement.” “Nothing in Europe,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm&quot;&gt;notes Jamil Ragep&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of the history of science at the University of Oklahoma, “could hold a candle to what was going on in the Islamic world until about 1600.” Algebra, algorithm, alchemy, alcohol, alkali, nadir, zenith, coffee, and lemon: these words all derive from Arabic, reflecting Islam’s contribution to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, the spirit of science in the Muslim world is as dry as the desert. Pakistani physicist Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy laid out the grim statistics in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_60/iss_8/49_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1&quot;&gt;a 2007 &lt;i&gt;Physics Today&lt;/i&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;: Muslim countries have nine scientists, engineers, and technicians per thousand people, compared with a world average of forty-one. In these nations, there are approximately 1,800 universities, but only 312 of those universities have scholars who have published journal articles. Of the fifty most-published of these universities, twenty-six are in Turkey, nine are in Iran, three each are in Malaysia and Egypt, Pakistan has two, and Uganda, the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and Azerbaijan each have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are roughly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/444035a&quot;&gt;only two scientists&lt;/a&gt; from Muslim countries have won Nobel Prizes in science (one for physics in 1979, the other for chemistry in 1999). Forty-six Muslim countries combined contribute just 1 percent of the world’s scientific literature; Spain and India each&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;contribute more of the world’s scientific literature than those countries taken together. In fact, although Spain is hardly an intellectual superpower, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/ahdr/ahdr2002e.pdf&quot;&gt;it translates more books&lt;/a&gt; in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years. “Though there are talented scientists of Muslim origin working productively in the West,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/religion/article2305888.ece&quot;&gt;Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg has observed&lt;/a&gt;, “for forty years I have not seen a single paper by a physicist or astronomer working in a Muslim country that was worth reading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparative metrics on the Arab world tell the same story. Arabs comprise 5 percent of the world’s population, but publish just 1.1 percent of its books, according to the U.N.’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/ahdr/ahdr2003e.pdf&quot;&gt;2003 Arab Human Development Report&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1980 and 2000, Korea granted 16,328 patents, while nine Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E., granted a combined total of only 370, many of them registered by foreigners. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/ahdr/ahdr2002e.pdf&quot;&gt;A study in 1989 found that&lt;/a&gt; in one year, the United States published 10,481 scientific papers that were frequently cited, while the entire Arab world published only four. This may sound like the punch line of a bad joke, but when &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; magazine published &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/416120a&quot;&gt;a sketch of science in the Arab world in 2002&lt;/a&gt;, its reporter identified just three scientific areas in which Islamic countries excel: desalination, falconry, and camel reproduction. The recent push to establish new research and science institutions in the Arab world — described in these pages by Waleed Al-Shobakky (see “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/petrodollar-science&quot;&gt;Petrodollar Science&lt;/a&gt;,” Fall 2008) — clearly still has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Arabic science was the most advanced in the world up until about the thirteenth century, it is tempting to ask what went wrong — why it is that modern science did not arise from Baghdad or Cairo or Córdoba. We will turn to this question later, but it is important to keep in mind that the decline of scientific activity is the rule, not the exception, of civilizations. While it is commonplace to assume that the scientific revolution and the progress of technology were inevitable, in fact the West is the single sustained success story out of many civilizations with periods of scientific flourishing. Like the Muslims, the ancient Chinese and Indian civilizations, both of which were at one time far more advanced than the West, did not produce the scientific revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, while the decline of Arabic civilization is not exceptional, the reasons for it offer insights into the history and nature of Islam and its relationship with modernity. Islam’s decline as an intellectual and political force was gradual but pronounced: while the Golden Age was extraordinarily productive, with the contributions made by Arabic thinkers often original and groundbreaking, the past seven hundred years tell a very different story.&lt;/p&gt;

		Original Contributions of Arabic Science	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; preliminary caution must be noted about both parts of the term “Arabic science.” This is, first, because the scientists discussed here were not all Arab Muslims. Indeed, most of the greatest thinkers of the era were not ethnically Arab. This is not surprising considering that, for several centuries throughout the Middle East, Muslims were a minority (a trend that only began to change at the end of the tenth century). The second caution about “Arabic science” is that it was not science as we are familiar with it today. Pre-modern science, while not blind to utility, sought knowledge primarily in order to understand philosophical questions concerned with meaning, being, the good, and so on. Modern science, by contrast, grew out of a revolution in thought that reoriented politics around individual comfort through the mastery of nature. Modern science dismisses ancient metaphysical questions as (to borrow Francis Bacon’s words) the pursuit of pleasure and vanity. Whatever modern science owes to Arabic science, the intellectual activity of the medieval Islamic world was not of the same kind as the European scientific revolution, which came after a radical break from ancient natural philosophy. Indeed, even though we use the term “science” for convenience, it is important to remember that this word was not coined until the nineteenth century; the closest word in Arabic — &lt;i&gt;ilm&lt;/i&gt; — means “knowledge,” and not necessarily that of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are two reasons why it makes sense to refer to scientific activity of the Golden Age as Arabic. The first is that most of the philosophical and scientific work at the time was eventually translated into Arabic, which became the language of most scholars in the region, regardless of ethnicity or religious background. And second, the alternatives — “Middle Eastern science” or “Islamic science” — are even less accurate. This is in part because very little is known about the personal backgrounds of these thinkers. But it is also because of another caution we must keep in mind about this subject, which ought to be footnoted to every broad assertion made about the Golden Age: surprisingly little is known for certain even about the social and historical context of this era. Abdelhamid I. Sabra, a now-retired professor of the history of Arabic science who taught at Harvard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html&quot;&gt;described his field to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 as one that “hasn’t even begun yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the field has advanced far enough to convincingly demonstrate that Arabic civilization contributed much more to the development of science than the passive transmission to the West of ancient thought and of inventions originating elsewhere (such as the numeral system from India and papermaking from China). For one thing, the scholarly revival in Abbasid Baghdad (751-1258) that resulted in the translation of almost all the scientific works of the classical Greeks into Arabic is nothing to scoff at. But beyond their translations of (and commentaries upon) the ancients, Arabic thinkers made original contributions, both through writing and methodical experimentation, in such fields as philosophy, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, geography, physics, optics, and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most oft-repeated claim about the Golden Age is that Muslims invented algebra. This claim is largely true: initially inspired by Greek and Indian works, the Persian al-Khwarizmi (died 850) wrote a book from whose title we get the term algebra. The book starts out with a mathematical introduction, and proceeds to explain how to solve then-commonplace issues involving trade, inheritance, marriage, and slave emancipations. (Its methods involve no equations or algebraic symbols, instead using geometrical figures to solve problems that today would be solved using algebra.) Despite its grounding in practical affairs, this book is the primary source that contributed to the development of the algebraic system that we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age also saw advances in medicine. One of the most famous thinkers in the history of Arabic science, and considered among the greatest of all medieval physicians, was Rhazes (also known as al-Razi). Born in present-day Tehran, Rhazes (died 925) was trained in Baghdad and became the director of two hospitals. He identified smallpox and measles, writing a treatise on them that became influential beyond the Middle East and into nineteenth-century Europe. Rhazes was the first to discover that fever is a defense mechanism. And he was the author of an encyclopedia of medicine that spanned twenty-three volumes. What is most striking about his career, as Ehsan Masood points out in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1848310811?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1848310811&quot;&gt;Science and Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is that Rhazes was the first to seriously challenge the seeming infallibility of the classical physician Galen. For example, he disputed Galen’s theory of humors, and he conducted a controlled experiment to see if bloodletting, which was the most common medical procedure up until the nineteenth century, actually worked as a medical treatment. (He found that it did.) Rhazes provides a clear instance of a thinker explicitly questioning, and empirically testing, the widely-accepted theories of an ancient giant, while making original contributions to a field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs in medicine continued with the physician and philosopher Avicenna (also known as Ibn-Sina; died 1037), whom some consider the most important physician since Hippocrates. He authored the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1871031672?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1871031672&quot;&gt;Canon of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a multi-volume medical survey that became the authoritative reference book for doctors in the region, and — once translated into Latin — a staple in the West for six centuries. The &lt;i&gt;Canon &lt;/i&gt;is a compilation of medical knowledge and a manual for drug testing, but it also includes Avicenna’s own discoveries, including the infectiousness of tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the later European Renaissance, the Arabic Golden Age also had many polymaths who excelled in and advanced numerous fields. One of the earliest such polymaths was al-Farabi (also known as Alpharabius, died ca. 950), a Baghdadi thinker who, in addition to his prolific writing on many aspects of Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, also wrote on physics, psychology, alchemy, cosmology, music, and much else. So esteemed was he that he came to be known as the “Second Teacher” — second greatest, that is, after Aristotle. Another great polymath was al-Biruni (died 1048), who wrote 146 treatises totaling 13,000 pages in virtually every scientific field. His major work, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393005682?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393005682&quot;&gt;The Description of India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was an anthropological work on Hindus. One of al-Biruni’s most notable accomplishments was the near-accurate measurement of the Earth’s circumference using his own trigonometric method; he missed the correct measurement of 24,900 miles by only 200 miles. (However, unlike Rhazes, Avicenna, and al-Farabi, al-Biruni’s works were never translated into Latin and thus did not have much influence beyond the Arabic world.) Another of the most brilliant minds of the Golden Age was the physicist and geometrician Alhazen (also known as Ibn al-Haytham; died 1040). Although his greatest legacy is in optics — he showed the flaws in the theory of extramission, which held that our eyes emit energy that makes it possible for us to see — he also did work in astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. And perhaps the most renowned scholar of the late Golden Age was Averroës (also known as Ibn Rushd; died 1198), a philosopher, theologian, physician, and jurist best known for his commentaries on Aristotle. The 20,000 pages he wrote over his lifetime included works in philosophy, medicine, biology, physics, and astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

		Why Arabic Science Thrived	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat prompted scientific scholarship to flourish where and when it did? What were the conditions that incubated these important Arabic-speaking scientific thinkers? There is, of course, no single explanation for the development of Arabic science, no single ruler who inaugurated it, no single culture that fueled it. As historian David C. Lindberg puts it in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226482057?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226482057&quot;&gt;The Beginnings of Western Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1992), Arabic science thrived for as long as it did thanks to “an incredibly complex concatenation of contingent circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific activity was reaching a peak when Islam was the dominant civilization in the world. So one important factor in the rise of the scholarly culture of the Golden Age was its material backdrop, provided by the rise of a powerful and prosperous empire. By the year 750, the Arabs had conquered Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, and much of North Africa, Central Asia, Spain, and the fringes of China and India. Newly opened routes connecting India and the Eastern Mediterranean spurred an explosion of wealth through trade, as well as an agricultural revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since the reign of Alexander the Great, the vast region was united politically and economically. The result was, first, an Arab kingdom under the Umayyad caliphs (ruling in Damascus from 661 to 750) and then an Islamic empire under the Abbasid caliphs (ruling in Baghdad from 751 to 1258), which saw the most intellectually productive age in Arab history.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The rise of the first centralized Islamic state under the Abbasids profoundly shaped life in the Islamic world, transforming it from a tribal culture with little literacy to a dynamic empire. To be sure, the vast empire was theologically and ethnically diverse; but the removal of political barriers that previously divided the region meant that scholars from different religious and ethnic backgrounds could travel and interact with each other. Linguistic barriers, too, were decreasingly an issue as Arabic became the common idiom of all scholars across the vast realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of empire brought urbanization, commerce, and wealth that helped spur intellectual collaboration. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cepr.org/meets/wkcn/1/1699/papers/Bosker.pdf&quot;&gt;Maarten Bosker of Utrecht University and his colleagues explain that&lt;/a&gt; in the year 800, while the Latin West (with the exception of Italy) was “relatively backward,” the Arab world was highly urbanized, with twice the urban population of the West. Several large metropolises — including Baghdad, Basra, Wasit, and Kufa — were unified under the Abbasids; they shared a single spoken language and brisk trade via a network of caravan roads. Baghdad in particular, the Abbasid capital, was home to palaces, mosques, joint-stock companies, banks, schools, and hospitals; by the tenth century, it was the largest city in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Abbasid empire grew, it also expanded eastward, bringing it into contact with the ancient Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Persian civilizations, the fruits of which it readily enjoyed. (In this era, Muslims found little of interest in the West, and for good reason.) One of the most important discoveries by Muslims was paper, which was probably invented in China around &lt;span&gt;a.d.&lt;/span&gt; 105 and brought into the Islamic world starting in the mid-eighth century. The effect of paper on the scholarly culture of Arabic society was enormous: it made the reproduction of books cheap and efficient, and it encouraged scholarship, correspondence, poetry, recordkeeping, and banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of paper also helped improve literacy, which had been encouraged since the dawn of Islam due to the religion’s literary foundation, the Koran. Medieval Muslims took religious scholarship very seriously, and some scientists in the region grew up studying it. Avicenna, for example, is said to have known the entire Koran by heart before he arrived at Baghdad. Might it be fair, then, to say that Islam itself encouraged scientific enterprise? This question provokes wildly divergent answers. Some scholars argue that there are many parts of the Koran and the &lt;i&gt;hadith&lt;/i&gt; (the sayings of Muhammad) that exhort believers to think about and try to understand Allah’s creations in a scientific spirit. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=-iQVAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA31&amp;amp;dq=&quot;&gt;one &lt;i&gt;hadith&lt;/i&gt; urges&lt;/a&gt;, “Seek knowledge, even in China.” But there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9744.2008.00925.x&quot;&gt;other scholars who argue&lt;/a&gt; that “knowledge” in the Koranic sense is not scientific knowledge but religious knowledge, and that to conflate such knowledge with modern science is inaccurate and even naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

		The Gift of Baghdad	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ut the single most significant reason that Arabic science thrived was the absorption and assimilation of the Greek heritage — a development fueled by the translation movement in Abbasid Baghdad. The translation movement, according to Yale historian and classicist Dimitri Gutas, is “equal in significance to, and belongs to the same narrative as … that of Pericles’ Athens, the Italian Renaissance, or the scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.” Whether or not one is willing to grant Gutas the comparison, there is no question that the translation movement in Baghdad — which by the year 1000 saw nearly the entire Greek corpus in medicine, mathematics, and natural philosophy translated into Arabic — provided the foundation for inquiry in the sciences. While most of the great thinkers in the Golden Age were not themselves in Baghdad, the Arabic world’s other cultural centers likely would not have thrived without Baghdad’s translation movement. For this reason, even if it is said that the Golden Age of Arabic science encompasses a large region, as a historical event it especially demands an explanation of the success of Abbasid Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise to power of the Abbasid caliphate in the year 750 was, as Bernard Lewis put it in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192803107?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0192803107&quot;&gt;The Arabs in History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1950), “a revolution in the history of Islam, as important a turning point as the French and Russian revolutions in the history of the West.” Instead of tribe and ethnicity, the Abbasids made religion and language the defining characteristics of state identity. This allowed for a relatively cosmopolitan society in which all Muslims could participate in cultural and political life. Their empire lasted until 1258, when the Mongols sacked Baghdad and executed the last Abbasid caliph (along with a large part of the Abbasid population). During the years that the Abbasid empire thrived, it deeply influenced politics and society from Tunisia to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek-Arabic translation movement in Abbasid Baghdad, like other scholarly efforts elsewhere in the Islamic world, was centered less in educational institutions than in the households of great patrons seeking social prestige. But Baghdad was distinctive: its philosophical and scientific activity enjoyed a high level of cultural support. As Gutas explains in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415061334?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415061334&quot;&gt;Greek Thought, Arabic Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1998), the translation movement, which mostly flourished from the middle of the eighth century to the end of the tenth, was a self-perpetuating enterprise supported by “the entire elite of Abbasid society: caliphs and princes, civil servants and military leaders, merchants and bankers, and scholars and scientists; it was not the pet project of any particular group in the furtherance of their restricted agenda.” This was an anomaly in the Islamic world, where for the most part&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;as Ehsan Masood argues, science was “supported by individual patrons, and when these patrons changed their priorities, or when they died, any institutions that they might have built often died with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to have been three salient factors inspiring the translation movement. First, the Abbasids found scientific Greek texts immensely useful for a sort of technological progress — solving common problems to make daily life easier. The Abbasids did not bother translating works in subjects such as poetry, history, or drama, which they regarded as useless or inferior. Indeed, science under Islam, although in part an extension of Greek science, was much less theoretical than that of the ancients. Translated works in mathematics, for example, were eventually used for engineering and irrigation, as well as in calculation for intricate inheritance laws. And translating Greek works on medicine had obvious practical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrology was another Greek subject adapted for use in Baghdad: the Abbasids turned to it for proof that the caliphate was the divinely ordained successor to the ancient Mesopotamian empires — although such claims were sometimes eyed warily, because the idea that celestial information can predict the future clashed with Islamic teaching that only God has such knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also practical religious reasons to study Greek science. Mosque timekeepers found it useful to study astronomy and trigonometry to determine the direction to Mecca (&lt;i&gt;qibla&lt;/i&gt;), the times for prayer, and the beginning of Ramadan. For example, the Arabic astronomer Ibn al-Shatir (died 1375) also served as a religious official, a timekeeper (&lt;i&gt;muwaqqit&lt;/i&gt;), for the Great Mosque of Damascus. Another religious motivation for translating Greek works was their value for the purposes of rhetoric and what we would today call ideological warfare: Aristotle’s &lt;i&gt;Topics&lt;/i&gt;, a treatise on logic, was used to aid in religious disputation with non-Muslims and in the conversion of nonbelievers to Islam (which was state policy under the Abbasids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second factor central to the rise of the translation movement was that Greek thought had already been diffused in the region, slowly and over a long period, before the Abbasids and indeed before the advent of Islam. Partly for this reason, the Abbasid Baghdad translation movement was not like the West’s subsequent rediscovery of ancient Athens, in that it was in some respects a continuation of Middle Eastern Hellenism. Greek thought spread as early as Alexander the Great’s conquests of Asia and North Africa in the 300s &lt;span&gt;b.c.&lt;/span&gt;, and Greek centers, such as in Alexandria and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (238-140 &lt;span&gt;b.c.&lt;/span&gt;, in what is now Afghanistan), were productive centers of learning even amid Roman conquest. By the time of the Arab conquests, the Greek tongue was known throughout the vast region, and it was the administrative language of Syria and Egypt. After the arrival of Christianity, Greek thought was spread further by missionary activity, especially by Nestorian Christians. Centuries later, well into the rule of the Abbasids in Baghdad, many of these Nestorians — some of them Arabs and Arabized Persians who eventually converted to Islam — contributed technical skill for the Greek-Arabic translation movement, and even filled many translation-oriented administrative posts in the Abbasid government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While practical utility and the influence of Hellenism help explain why science &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; develop, both were true of most of the Arabic world during the Golden Age and so cannot account for the Abbasid translation movement in particular. As Gutas argues, the distinguishing factor that led to that movement was the attempt by the Abbasid rulers to legitimize their rule by co-opting Persian culture, which at the time deeply revered Greek thought. The Baghdad region in which the Abbasids established themselves included a major Persian population, which played an instrumental role in the revolution that ended the previous dynasty; thus, the Abbasids made many symbolic and political gestures to ingratiate themselves with the Persians. In an effort to enfold this constituency into a reliable ruling base, the Abbasids incorporated Zoroastrianism and the imperial ideology of the defunct Persian Sasanian Empire, more than a century gone, into their political platform. The Abbasid rulers sought to establish the idea that they were the successors not to the defeated Arab Umayyads who had been overthrown in 650 but to the region’s previous imperial dynasty, the Sasanians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incorporation of Sasanian ideology led to the translation of Greek texts into Arabic because doing so was seen as recovering not just Greek, but Persian knowledge. The Persians believed that sacred ancient Zoroastrian texts were scattered by Alexander the Great’s destruction of Persepolis in 330 &lt;span&gt;b.c.&lt;/span&gt;, and were subsequently appropriated by the Greeks. By translating ancient Greek texts into Arabic, Persian wisdom could be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Arab Muslims themselves did not seem to care much about the translation movement and the study of science, feeling that they had “no ethnic or historical stake in it,” as Gutas explains. This began to change during the reign of al-Mamun (died 833), the seventh Abbasid caliph. For the purposes of opposing the Byzantine Empire, al-Mamun reoriented the translation movement as a means to recovering Greek, rather than Persian, learning. In the eyes of Abbasid Muslims of this era, the ancient Greeks did not have a pristine reputation — they were not Muslims, after all — but at least they were not tainted with Christianity. The fact that the hated Christian Byzantines did not embrace the ancient Greeks, though, led the Abbasids to warm to them. This philhellenism in the centuries after al-Mamun marked a prideful distinction between the Arabs — who considered themselves “champions of the truth,” as Gutas puts it — and their benighted Christian contemporaries. One Arab philosopher, al-Kindi (died 870), even devised a genealogy that presented Yunan, the ancestor of the ancient Greeks, as the brother of Qahtan, the ancestor of the Arabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until its collapse in the Mongol invasion of 1258, the Abbasid caliphate was the greatest power in the Islamic world and oversaw the most intellectually productive movement in Arab history. The Abbasids read, commented on, translated, and preserved Greek and Persian works that may have been otherwise lost. By making Greek thought accessible, they also formed the foundation of the Arabic Golden Age. Major works of philosophy and science far from Baghdad — in Spain, Egypt, and Central Asia — were influenced by Greek-Arabic translations, both during and after the Abbasids. Indeed, even if it is a matter of conjecture to what extent the rise of science in the West depended on Arabic science, there is no question that the West benefited from both the preservation of Greek works and from original Arabic scholarship that commented on them.&lt;/p&gt;

		Why the Golden Age Faded	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;s the Middle Ages progressed, Arabic civilization began to run out of steam. After the twelfth century, Europe had more significant scientific scholars than the Arabic world, as Harvard historian George Sarton noted in his &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882751727?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0882751727&quot;&gt;Introduction to the History of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1927-48). After the fourteenth century, the Arab world saw very few innovations in fields that it had previously dominated, such as optics and medicine; henceforth, its innovations were for the most part not in the realm of metaphysics or science, but were more narrowly practical inventions like vaccines. “The Renaissance, the Reformation, even the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, passed unnoticed in the Muslim world,” Bernard Lewis remarks in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195090616?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195090616&quot;&gt;Islam and the West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a modest rebirth of science in the Arabic world in the nineteenth century due largely to Napoleon’s 1798 expedition to Egypt, but it was soon followed by decline. Lewis notes in &lt;i&gt;What Went Wrong?&lt;/i&gt; that “The relationship between Christendom and Islam in the sciences was now reversed. Those who had been disciples now became teachers; those who had been masters became pupils, often reluctant and resentful pupils.” The civilization that had produced cities, libraries, and observatories and opened itself to the world had now regressed and become closed, resentful, violent, and hostile to discourse and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened? To repeat an important point, scientific decline is hardly peculiar to Arabic-Islamic civilization. Such decline is the norm of history; only in the West did something very different happen. Still, it may be possible to discern some specific causes of decline — and attempting to do so can deepen our understanding of Arabic-Islamic civilization and its tensions with modernity. As Sayyid Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, an influential figure in contemporary pan-Islamism,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=cI48B54Wv7gC&amp;amp;lpg=PA30&amp;amp;ots=YjA5rZJDcU&amp;amp;dq=&quot;&gt;said in the late nineteenth century&lt;/a&gt;, “It is permissible … to ask oneself why Arab civilization, after having thrown such a live light on the world, suddenly became extinguished; why this torch has not been relit since; and why the Arab world still remains buried in profound darkness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there is no simple explanation for the success of Arabic science, there is no simple explanation for its gradual — not sudden, as al-Afghani claims — demise. The most significant factor was physical and geopolitical. As early as the tenth or eleventh century, the Abbasid empire began to factionalize and fragment due to increased provincial autonomy and frequent uprisings. By 1258, the little that was left of the Abbasid state was swept away by the Mongol invasion. And in Spain, Christians reconquered Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. But the Islamic turn away from scholarship actually preceded the civilization’s geopolitical decline — it can be traced back to the rise of the anti-philosophical Ash’arism school among Sunni Muslims, who comprise the vast majority of the Muslim world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this anti-rationalist movement, we once again turn our gaze back to the time of the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun. Al-Mamun picked up the pro-science torch lit by the second caliph, al-Mansur, and ran with it. He responded to a crisis of legitimacy by attempting to undermine traditionalist religious scholars&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;while actively sponsoring a doctrine called Mu’tazilism that was deeply influenced by Greek rationalism, particularly Aristotelianism. To this end, he imposed an inquisition, under which those who refused to profess their allegiance to Mu’tazilism were punished by flogging, imprisonment, or beheading. But the caliphs who followed al-Mamun upheld the doctrine with less fervor, and within a few decades, adherence to it became a punishable offense. The backlash against Mu’tazilism was tremendously successful: by 885, a half century after al-Mamun’s death, it even became a crime to copy books of philosophy. The beginning of the de-Hellenization of Arabic high culture was underway. By the twelfth or thirteenth century, the influence of Mu’tazilism was nearly completely marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its place arose the anti-rationalist Ash’ari school whose increasing dominance is linked to the decline of Arabic science. With the rise of the Ash’arites, the ethos in the Islamic world was increasingly opposed to original scholarship and any scientific inquiry that did not directly aid in religious regulation of private and public life. While the Mu’tazilites had contended that the Koran was &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; and so God’s purpose for man must be interpreted through reason, the Ash’arites believed the Koran to be coeval with God — and therefore unchallengeable. At the heart of Ash’ari metaphysics is the idea of occasionalism, a doctrine that denies natural causality. Put simply, it suggests natural necessity cannot exist because God’s will is completely free. Ash’arites believed that God is the only cause, so that the world is a series of discrete physical events each willed by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Maimonides described it in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1177683164?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1177683164&quot;&gt;The Guide for the Perplexed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, this view sees natural things that appear to be permanent as merely following habit. Heat follows fire and hunger follows lack of food as a matter of habit, not necessity, “just as the king generally rides on horseback through the streets of the city, and is never found departing from this habit; but reason does not find it impossible that he should walk on foot through the place.” According to the occasionalist view, tomorrow coldness might follow fire, and satiety might follow lack of food. God wills every single atomic event and God’s will is not bound up with reason. This amounts to a denial of the coherence and comprehensibility of the natural world. In his controversial 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html&quot;&gt;University of Regensburg address&lt;/a&gt;, Pope Benedict XVI&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;described this idea by quoting the philosopher Ibn Hazm (died 1064) as saying, “Were it God’s will, we would even have to practice idolatry.” It is not difficult to see how this doctrine could lead to dogma and eventually to the end of free inquiry in science and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest and most influential voice of the Ash’arites was the medieval theologian Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (also known as Algazel; died 1111). In his book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842524665?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0842524665&quot;&gt;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, al-Ghazali vigorously attacked philosophy and philosophers — both the Greek philosophers themselves and their followers in the Muslim world (such as al-Farabi and Avicenna). Al-Ghazali was worried that when people become favorably influenced by philosophical arguments, they will also come to trust the philosophers on matters of religion, thus making Muslims less pious. Reason, because it teaches us to discover, question, and innovate, was the enemy; al-Ghazali argued that in assuming necessity in nature, philosophy was incompatible with Islamic teaching, which recognizes that nature is entirely subject to God’s will: “Nothing in nature,” he wrote, “can act spontaneously and apart from God.” While al-Ghazali did defend logic, he did so only to the extent that it could be used to ask theological questions and wielded as a tool to undermine philosophy. Sunnis embraced al-Ghazali as the winner of the debate with the Hellenistic rationalists, and opposition to philosophy gradually ossified, even to the extent that independent inquiry became a tainted enterprise, sometimes to the point of criminality. It is an exaggeration to say, as Steven Weinberg &lt;a href=&quot;http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/religion/article2305888.ece&quot;&gt;claimed in the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; of London&lt;/a&gt;, that after al-Ghazali “there was no more science worth mentioning in Islamic countries”; in some places, especially Central Asia, Arabic work in science continued for some time, and philosophy was still studied somewhat under Shi’ite rule. (In the Sunni world, philosophy turned into mysticism.) But the fact is, Arab contributions to science became increasingly sporadic as the anti-rationalism sank in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ash’ari view has endured to this day. Its most extreme form can be seen in some sects of Islamists. For example, Mohammed Yusuf, the late leader of a group called the Nigerian Taliban, explained why “Western education is a sin” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8172270.stm&quot;&gt;explaining its view on rain&lt;/a&gt;: “We believe it is a creation of God rather than an evaporation caused by the sun that condenses and becomes rain.” The Ash’ari view is also evident when Islamic leaders attribute natural disasters to God’s vengeance, as they did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQj8UjU5eOg&quot;&gt;when they said that&lt;/a&gt; the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano was the result of God’s anger at immodestly dressed women in Europe. Such inferences sound crazy to Western ears, but given their frequency in the Muslim world, they must sound at least a little less crazy to Muslims. As Robert R. Reilly argues in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933859911?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1933859911&quot;&gt;The Closing of the Muslim Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2010), “the fatal disconnect between the creator and the mind of his creature is the source of Sunni Islam’s most profound woes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar ossification occurred in the realm of law. The first four centuries of Islam saw vigorous discussion and flexibility regarding legal issues; this was the tradition of &lt;i&gt;ijtihad&lt;/i&gt;, or independent judgment and critical thinking. But by the end of the eleventh century, discordant ideas were increasingly seen as a problem, and autocratic rulers worried about dissent — so the “gates of &lt;i&gt;ijtiha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;” were closed for Sunni Muslims: &lt;i&gt;ijtihad&lt;/i&gt; was seen as no longer necessary, since all important legal questions were regarded as already answered. New readings of Islamic revelation became a crime. All that was left to do was to submit to the instructions of religious authorities; to understand morality, one needed only to read legal decrees. Thinkers who resisted the closing came to be seen as nefarious dissidents. (Averroës, for example, was banished for heresy and his books were burned.)&lt;/p&gt;

		Why Inquiry Failed in the Islamic World	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ut is Ash’arism the deepest root of Arabic science’s demise? That the Ash’arites won and the Mu’tazilites lost suggests that for whatever reason, Muslims already found Ash’ari thought more convincing or more palatable; it suited prevailing sentiments and political ideas. Indeed, Muslim theologians appeared receptive to the occasionalist view as early as the ninth century, before the founder of Ash’arism was even born. Thus the Ash’ari victory raises thorny questions about the theological-political predispositions of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of articulating questions that lie deeper than the Ash’arism-Mu’tazilism debate, it is helpful to briefly compare Islam with Christianity. Christianity acknowledges a private-public distinction and (theoretically, at least) allows adherents the liberty to decide much about their social and political lives. Islam, on the other hand, denies any private-public distinction and includes laws regulating the most minute details of private life. Put another way, Islam does not acknowledge any difference between religious and political ends: it is a religion that specifies political rules for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such differences between the two faiths can be traced to the differences between their prophets. While Christ was an outsider of the state who ruled no one, and while Christianity did not become a state religion until centuries after Christ’s birth, Mohammed was not only a prophet but also a chief magistrate, a political leader who conquered and governed a religious community he founded. Because Islam was born outside of the Roman Empire, it was never subordinate to politics. As Bernard Lewis puts it, Mohammed was his own Constantine. This means that, for Islam, religion and politics were interdependent from the beginning; Islam needs a state to enforce its laws, and the state needs a basis in Islam to be legitimate. To what extent, then, do Islam’s political proclivities make free inquiry — which is inherently subversive to established rules and customs — possible at a deep and enduring institutional level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some clues can be found by comparing institutions in the medieval period. Far from accepting anything close to the occasionalism and legal positivism of the Sunnis, European scholars argued explicitly that when the Bible contradicts the natural world, the holy book should not be taken literally. Influential philosophers like Augustine held that knowledge and reason precede Christianity; he approached the subject of scientific inquiry with cautious encouragement, exhorting Christians to use the classical sciences as a handmaiden of Christian thought. Galileo’s house arrest notwithstanding, his famous remark that “the intention of the Holy Ghost is to teach us how one goes to heaven, not how heaven goes” underscores the durability of the scientific spirit among pious Western societies. Indeed, as David C. Lindberg argues in an essay collected in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674057414?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674057414&quot;&gt;Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2009), “No institution or cultural force of the patristic period offered more encouragement for the investigation of nature than did the Christian church.” And, as Baylor University sociologist Rodney Stark notes in his book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691119503?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691119503&quot;&gt;For the Glory of God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2003), many of the greatest scientists of the scientific revolution were also Christian priests or ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church’s acceptance and even encouragement of philosophy and science was evident from the High Middle Ages to modern times. As the late Ernest L. Fortin of Boston College noted in an essay collected in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0847682773?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0847682773&quot;&gt;Classical Christianity and the Political Order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1996), unlike al-Farabi and his successors, “Aquinas was rarely forced to contend with an anti-philosophic bias on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities. As a Christian, he could simply assume philosophy without becoming publicly involved in any argument for or against it.” And when someone like Galileo got in trouble, his work moved forward and his inquiry was carried on by others; in other words, institutional dedication to scientific inquiry was too entrenched in Europe for any authority to control. After about the middle of the thirteenth century in the Latin West, we know of no instance of persecution of anyone who advocated philosophy as an aid in interpreting revelation. In this period, “attacks on reason would have been regarded as bizarre and unacceptable,” explains historian Edward Grant in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801884012?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0801884012&quot;&gt;Science and Religion, 400 &lt;span&gt;b.c.&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span&gt;a.d.&lt;/span&gt; 1550&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the West is a topic that could fill — indeed, has filled — many large books. But some general comparisons are helpful in understanding why Islam was so institutionally different from the West. The most striking difference is articulated by Bassam Tibi in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520236904?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0520236904&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1998): “because rational disciplines had not been institutionalized in classical Islam, the adoption of the Greek legacy had no lasting effect on Islamic civilization.” In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521529948?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521529948&quot;&gt;The Rise of Early Modern Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Toby E. Huff makes a persuasive argument for why modern science emerged in the West and not in Islamic (or Chinese) civilization:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of modern science is the result of the development of a civilizationally based culture that was uniquely humanistic in the sense that it tolerated, indeed, protected and promoted those heretical and innovative ideas that ran counter to accepted religious and theological teaching. Conversely, one might say that critical elements of the scientific worldview were surreptitiously encoded in the religious and legal presuppositions of the European West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In other words, Islamic civilization did not have a culture hospitable to the advancement of science, while medieval Europe did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast is most obvious in the realm of formal education. As Huff argues, the lack of a scientific curriculum in medieval madrassas reflects a deeper absence of a capacity or willingness to build legally autonomous institutions. Madrassas were established under the law of &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt;, or pious endowments, which meant they were legally obligated to follow the religious commitments of their founders. Islamic law did not recognize any corporate groups or entities, and so prevented any hope of recognizing institutions such as universities within which scholarly norms could develop. (Medieval China, too, had no independent institutions dedicated to learning; all were dependent on the official bureaucracy and the state.) Legally autonomous institutions were utterly absent in the Islamic world until the late nineteenth century. And madrassas nearly always excluded study of anything besides the subjects that aid in understanding Islam: Arabic grammar, the Koran, the hadith, and the principles of sharia. These were often referred to as the “Islamic sciences,” in contrast to Greek sciences, which were widely referred to as the “foreign” or “alien” sciences (indeed, the term “philosopher” in Arabic — &lt;i&gt;faylasu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; — was often used pejoratively). Furthermore, the rigidity of the religious curriculum in madrassas contributed to the educational method of learning by rote; even today, repetition, drill, and imitation — with chastisement for questioning or innovating — are habituated at an early age in many parts of the Arab world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exclusion of science and mathematics from the madrassas suggests that these subjects “were institutionally marginal in medieval Islamic life,” writes Huff. Such inquiry was tolerated, and sometimes promoted by individuals, but it was never “officially institutionalized and sanctioned by the intellectual elite of Islam.” This meant that when intellectual discoveries were made, they were not picked up and carried by students, and did not influence later thinkers in Muslim communities. No one paid much attention to the work of Averroës after he was driven out of Spain to Morocco, for instance — that is, until Europeans rediscovered his work. Perhaps the lack of institutional support for science allowed Arabic thinkers (such as al-Farabi) to be bolder than their European counterparts. But it also meant that many Arabic thinkers relied on the patronage of friendly rulers and ephemeral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of contrast, the legal system that developed in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Europe — which saw the absorption of Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Christian theology — was instrumental in forming a philosophically and theologically open culture that respected scientific development. As Huff argues, because European universities were legally autonomous, they could develop their own rules, scholarly norms, and curricula. The norms they incorporated were those of curiosity and skepticism, and the curricula they chose were steeped in ancient Greek philosophy. In the medieval Western world, a spirit of skepticism and inquisitiveness moved theologians and philosophers. It was a spirit of “probing and poking around,” as Edward Grant writes in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521802792?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521802792&quot;&gt;God and Reason in the Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this attitude of inquiry that helped lay the foundation for modern science. Beginning in the early Middle Ages, this attitude was evident in technological innovations among even unlearned artisans and merchants. These obscure people contributed to the development of practical technologies, such as the mechanical clock (circa 1272) and spectacles (circa 1284). Even as early as the sixth century, Europeans strove to invent labor-saving technology, such as the heavy-wheeled plow and, later, the padded horse collar. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/52639/bernard-lewis/the-west-and-the-middle-east&quot;&gt;research by the late Charles Issawi&lt;/a&gt; of Princeton University, eleventh-century England had more mills per capita than even the Ottoman lands at the height of the empire’s power. And although it was in use since 1460 in the West, the printing press was not introduced in the Islamic world until 1727. The Arabic world appears to have been even slower in finding uses for academic technological devices. For instance, the telescope appeared in the Middle East soon after its invention in 1608, but it failed to attract excitement or interest until centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As science in the Arabic world declined and retrogressed, Europe hungrily absorbed and translated classical and scientific works, mainly through cultural centers in Spain. By 1200, Oxford and Paris had curricula that included works of Arabic science. Works by Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, and Galen, along with commentaries by Avicenna and Averroës, were all translated into Latin. Not only were these works taught openly, but they were formally incorporated into the program of study of universities. Meanwhile, in the Islamic world, the dissolution of the Golden Age was well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

		A Gold Standard?	&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n trying to explain the Islamic world’s intellectual laggardness, it is tempting to point to the obvious factors: authoritarianism, bad education, and underfunding (Muslim states spend significantly less than developed states on research and development as a percentage of GDP). But these reasons are all broad and somewhat crude, and raise more questions than answers. At a deeper level, Islam lags because it failed to offer a way to institutionalize free inquiry. That, in turn, is attributable to its failure to reconcile faith and reason. In this respect, Islamic societies have fared worse not just than the West but also than many societies of Asia. With a couple of exceptions, every country in the Middle Eastern parts of the Muslim world has been ruled by an autocrat, a radical Islamic sect, or a tribal chieftain. Islam has no tradition of separating politics and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline of Islam and the rise of Christianity was a development that was and remains deeply humiliating for Muslims. Since Islam tended to ascribe its political power to its theological superiority over other faiths, its fading as a worldly power raised profound questions about where a wrong turn was made. Over at least the past century, Muslim reformers have been debating how best to reacquire the lost honor. In the same period, the Muslim world tried, and failed, to reverse its decline by borrowing Western technology and sociopolitical ideas, including secularization and nationalism. But these tastes of “modernization” turned many Muslims away from modernity. This raises a question: Can and should Islam’s past achievements serve as a standard for Islam’s future? After all, it is quite common to imply, as President Obama did, that knowledge of the Golden Age of Arabic science will somehow exhort the Islamic world to improve itself and to hate the West less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Arabic science offers a window into the relationship between Islam and modernity; perhaps, too, it holds out the prospect of Islam coming to benefit from principles it badly needs in order to prosper, such as sexual equality, the rule of law, and free civil life. But the predominant posture among many Muslims today is that the good life is best approximated by returning to a pristine and pious past — and this posture has proven poisonous to coping with modernity. Islamism, the cause of violence that the world is now agonizingly familiar with, arises from doctrines characterized by a deep nostalgia for the Islamic classical period. Even today, suggesting that the Koran isn’t coeternal with God can make one an infidel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet intellectual progress and cultural openness were once encouraged among many Arabic societies. So to the extent that appeals to the salutary classical attitude can be found in the Islamic tradition, the fanatical false nostalgia might be tamed. Some reformers already point out that many medieval Muslims embraced reason and other ideas that presaged modernity, and that doing so is not impious and does not mean simply giving up eternal rewards for materialistic ones. On an intellectual level, this effort could be deepened by challenging the Ash’ari orthodoxy that has dominated Sunni Islam for a thousand years — that is, by asking whether al-Ghazali and his Ash’arite followers really understood nature, theology, and philosophy better than the Mu’tazilites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are reasons why exhortation to emulate Muslim ancestors may also be misguided. One is that medieval Islam does not offer a decent political standard. When compared to modern Western standards, the Golden Age of Arabic science was decidedly not a Golden Age of equality. While Islam was comparatively tolerant at the time of members of other religions, the kind of tolerance we think of today was never a virtue for early Muslims (or early Christians, for that matter). As Bernard Lewis puts it in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415611806?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415611806&quot;&gt;The Jews of Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (1984), giving equal treatment to followers and rejecters of the true faith would have been seen not only as an absurdity but also an outright “dereliction of duty.” Jews and Christians were subjected to official second-class sociopolitical status beginning in Mohammed’s time, and Abbasid-era oppressions also included religious persecution and the eradication of churches and synagogues. The Golden Age was also an era of widespread slavery of persons deemed to be of even lower class. For all the estimable achievements of the medieval Arabic world, it is quite clear that its political and social history should not be made into a celebrated standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a more fundamental reason, however, why it may not make much sense to urge the Muslim world to restore those parts of its past that valued rational and open inquiry: namely, a return to the Mu’tazilites may not be enough. Even the most rationalist schools in Islam did not categorically argue for the primacy of reason. As Ali A. Allawi argues in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300164068?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0300164068&quot;&gt;The Crisis of Islamic Civilization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (2009), “None of the free-thinking schools in classical Islam — such as the Mu’tazila — could ever entertain the idea of breaking the God-Man relationship and the validity of revelation, in spite of their espousal of a rationalist philosophy.” Indeed, in 1889 the Hungarian scholar Ignaz Goldziher noted in his essay “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0202307786?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=the-new-atlantis-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0202307786&quot;&gt;The Attitude of Orthodox Islam Toward the ‘Ancient Sciences’&lt;/a&gt;” that it was not only Ash’arite but Mu’tazilite circles that “produced numerous polemical treatises against Aristotelian philosophy in general and against logic in particular.” Even before al-Ghazali’s attack on the Mu’tazilites, engaging in Greek philosophy was not exactly a safe task outside of auspicious but rather ephemeral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, merely popularizing previous rationalist schools would not go very far in persuading Muslims to reflect on the theological-political problem of Islam. For all the great help that the rediscovery of the influential Arabic philosophers (especially al-Farabi, Averroës, and Maimonides) would provide, no science-friendly Islamic tradition goes nearly far enough, to the point that it offers a theological renovation in the vein of Luther and Calvin — a reinterpretation of Islam that challenges the faith’s comprehensive ruling principles in a way that simultaneously convinces Muslims that they are in fact returning to the fundamentals of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a final reason why it makes little sense to exhort Muslims to their own past: while there are many things that the Islamic world lacks, pride in heritage is not one of them. What is needed in Islam is less self-pride and more self-criticism. Today, self-criticism in Islam is valued only insofar as it is made as an appeal to be more pious and less spiritually corrupt. And yet most criticism in the Muslim world is directed outward, at the West. This prejudice — what Fouad Ajami has called (referring to the Arab world) “a political tradition of belligerent self-pity” — is undoubtedly one of Islam’s biggest obstacles. It makes information that contradicts orthodox belief irrelevant, and it closes off debate about the nature and history of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, inquiry into the history of Arabic science, and the recovery and research of manuscripts of the era, may have a beneficial effect — so long as it is pursued in an analytical spirit. That would mean that Muslims would use it as a resource within their own tradition to &lt;i&gt;critically &lt;/i&gt;engage with their philosophical, political, and founding flaws. If that occurs, it will not arise from any Western outreach efforts, but will be a consequence of Muslims’ own determination, creativity, and wisdom — in short, those very traits that Westerners rightly ascribe to the Muslims of the Golden Age.&lt;/p&gt;                  </description>
