<title>EFF’s Tweet About a DMCA Takedown Is Now Subject to an Overzealous Takedown</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/effs-tweet-about-overzealous-dmca-takedown-now-subject-overzealous-takedown</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/effs-tweet-about-overzealous-dmca-takedown-now-subject-overzealous-takedown</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Get ready for a tale as good as anything you’d see on television. Here’s the sequence of events: the website TorrentFreak publishes an article about a leak of TV episodes, including shows from the network Starz. TorrentFreak tweets its article, Starz sends a copyright takedown notice. TorrentFreak writes about the takedown, including a comment from EFF. EFF tweets the article about the takedown and the original article. EFF’s tweet…gets hit with a takedown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/promo-screeners-of-american-gods-and-other-tv-shows-leak-online-190408/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about leaked episodes of television does contain a few screenshots of some of the leaked episodes—enough to establish the veracity of the story. It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contain links to download the episodes, a fact to keep in mind as this story goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TorrentFreak then tweeted a link to its article, which did contain a thumbnail image, but not one that matches any of the screenshots in the article. An agency acting on behalf of Starz then used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to have Twitter remove the tweet, alleging copyright infringement. The complaint TorrentFreak received says the article has “images of unreleased episodes” of the show &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;. It also maintains that TorrentFreak supplies “information about their illegal availability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: TorrentFreak reporting about an illegal event is not illegal. Reporting about copyright infringement is not infringement. The few thumbnails—including a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; image from &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;—act as proof of the story being reported and certainly don’t replace watching entire episodes of television. (If you don’t believe me, go look at a single screenshot from a show and figure out if it scratches the same itch as watching a whole hour of TV.) The screenshot also illustrated the watermarks in the leaked episode, which suggest that the leak came from a pre-release screener copy sent to TV critics, as the TorrentFreak article discusses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles reporting on true events are textbook examples of fair use. Using the DMCA in this way is an attack on journalism and fair use. Which is what we would have said if asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. We were asked. TorrentFreak followed up its first &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/starz-doesnt-like-news-about-leaked-tv-shows-takes-down-torrentfreak-tweet-190411/&quot;&gt;article with one about the takedown&lt;/a&gt; it received. They reached out for comment, and, among other things, EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kit Walsh told TorrentFreak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starz has no right to silence TorrentFreak’s news article or block links to it. The article reports that there are people on the Internet infringing copyright, but that is a far cry from being an infringement itself. The screenshots are important parts of the reporting that validate the facts being reported. Starz should withdraw its takedown and refrain from harassing journalists in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our wont, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eff/status/1116784423167336448&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out a link to TorrentFreak’s original article, with text nearly identical to Walsh’s statement to TorrentFreak. A few days later, we also received a takedown and our tweet was blocked. At this point, you may have noticed just how far removed we are from anything that remotely resembles copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2019/04/14/torrentfreaktweet_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1254&quot; height=&quot;638&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMCA notice we received from Twitter was sent by Starz.  In the field labeled “links to original work,” Starz wrote “n/a.” To reiterate: in the field about where the original work being infringed on can be located, the answer is “not applicable.” Under “Description of infringement,” it says, “Link to bootleg.” There’s no bootleg link in any of the articles or tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending a DMCA complaint requires a sworn statement that the person sending the complaint actually believes it to be copyright infringement. Look at this sequence of events again and try to imagine sending a takedown for our tweet honestly believing it to be infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMCA process allows us to send a counterclaim, explaining that the tweet is not infringement and directing Twitter to restore the tweet, barring a copyright infringement lawsuit being filed by Starz. We have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMCA claims can be intimidating, especially to people who don’t know the ins and outs of the process. Fortunately, EFF is an organization that &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca&quot;&gt;knows its rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property&quot;&gt;how to exercise them.&lt;/a&gt; And we’ll keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/takedowns&quot;&gt;calling out abusive takedowns&lt;/a&gt; and helping people defend their rights to speak on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;When chrome launched things got complicated, but not in the way you might expect. They had a competing product now, but they didn’t cut ties, break our search deal - nothing like that. In fact, the story we kept hearing was, “We’re on the same side. We want the same things.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>1060-hour image of the Large Magellanic Cloud captured by amateur astronomers</title>
<link>https://astrospace-page.blogspot.com/2019/04/1060-hours-image-of-the-large-magellanic-cloud-chile.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://astrospace-page.blogspot.com/2019/04/1060-hours-image-of-the-large-magellanic-cloud-chile.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1060 is the number of hours&lt;/strong&gt; needed to capture this highly-resolved image (204 Megapixels) of the Large Magellanic Cloud. It might be the &lt;strong&gt;world's longest exposure image within the amateur astronomers community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In astrophotography, the amount of time you spend imaging a celestial object is inherently fundamental. The l&lt;strong&gt;onger your camera's shutter is open, the more light you get&lt;/strong&gt;, so that the darkest regions of the sky start to get clearer. Usually, amateur astronomers are familiar with very long integration times, such as few minutes or even few tens of hours. However, reaching a total amount of several hundred hours increases the complexity of image processing and therefore remains quiet rare... though, &lt;strong&gt;five keen amateur astrophotographers&lt;/strong&gt; challenged themselves and decided to &lt;strong&gt;capture a picture of 1060 hours of total exposure time&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be &lt;strong&gt;considered as a world record&lt;/strong&gt; (professional astronomy excluded).&lt;p&gt;This image is not only a technical accomplishment, but &lt;strong&gt;brings also a scientific interest&lt;/strong&gt; to one of the most amazing deep sky object of the Southern sky : &lt;strong&gt;The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;★ A Team of amateur astronomers behind this feat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The image is a mosaic made of &lt;strong&gt;16 smaller fields of view&lt;/strong&gt;, which, once stitched together form a &lt;strong&gt;high-resolution image of 204 Million of pixels&lt;/strong&gt;! As of matter of fact, this is not the work of a single person but by a &lt;strong&gt;team of five french amateur astronomers called &quot;Ciel Austral&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;em&gt;Jean Claude CANONNE, Philippe BERNHARD, Didier CHAPLAIN, Nicolas OUTTERS et Laurent BOURGON&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&quot;Ciel Austral&quot; owns a remotely-controlled observatory located in the most prestigious skies of the planet, &lt;strong&gt;in Chile&lt;/strong&gt;, and more precisely at the El Sauce Observatory (Coquimbo Region). A 160-mm APO-refractor telescope and a Moravian CCD were used to obtain this wonderful field. The datasets were &lt;strong&gt;taken over several months,&lt;/strong&gt; ranging from 2018 and 2019. The heavy files handled represent &lt;strong&gt;620 GB&lt;/strong&gt; and needed few hundreds of hours to get out of the image processing step! Once stacked together, they make up the stunning figure of 1060 hours of exposure. If you are more curious, we invite you having a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cielaustral.com/galerie/photo95.htm?fbclid=IwAR3GMt0zg_9VrcXH3moy7-lR7stH2Gb-ZOYPpvpTKMZooK7LpMBa97PQx2Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their official website here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You certainly noticed the color-rendering of this image is quite unusual. Indeed, astrophotographers used a couple of &lt;strong&gt;special filters&lt;/strong&gt; which transmit narrow parts -lines- of the visible spectrum : the &lt;strong&gt;Hydrogen Alpha&lt;/strong&gt; line at 656 nm, the &lt;strong&gt;Sulfur&lt;/strong&gt; line at 672 nm and the &lt;strong&gt;Oxygen III&lt;/strong&gt; spectral line at 500 nm. These kind of filters enable to &lt;strong&gt;emphasize chemical components located in high-density gas regions like nebulae&lt;/strong&gt;, what standard RGB imaging can not perform.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Settled in Chile since 2017, the Ciel Austral Observatory gives to this 5-member team a way to expanding their knowledge and skills in astronomical imagery in order to fulfill its most ambitious projects. So, one should stay tuned for more of their upcoming fantastic images.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;★ The Large Magellanic Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This image shows us a unique view of the most famous night-sky object for Southern-Hemisphere astronomy. The LMC is actually a &lt;strong&gt;satellite neighbor&lt;/strong&gt; of our Milky Way galaxy pretty close to us, at 50 kilo-parsecs distance (163k light-years). Scientists estimate it will do a full orbit around us in only 1.5 Billion years...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The Large Magellanic Cloud belongs to the Local Group - a list of about 50 galaxies close to each other, including our own. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to spend a night under the Southern Skies, this naked-eye-visible object will surprise you by its &lt;strong&gt;wide angular size and its strong brightness&lt;/strong&gt;: LMC covers a slice of the sky which can contain &lt;strong&gt;20 moon diameters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;shining at a 0.9 magnitude&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Want to learn a new skill? Take some short breaks</title>
<link>https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/News-and-Press-Releases/Press-Releases/Want-learn-new-skill-Take-some-short-breaks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ninds.nih.gov/News-Events/News-and-Press-Releases/Press-Releases/Want-learn-new-skill-Take-some-short-breaks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NIH study suggests our brains may use short rest periods to strengthen memories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of healthy volunteers, National Institutes of Health researchers found that our brains may solidify the memories of new skills we just practiced a few seconds earlier by taking a short rest. The results highlight the critically important role rest may play in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone thinks you need to ‘practice, practice, practice’ when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, may be just as critical to learning as practice,” said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a senior author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology. “Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to ‘relearn’ lost skills.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Marlene Bönstrup, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen’s lab. Like many scientists, she held the general belief that our brains needed long periods of rest, such as a good night’s sleep, to strengthen the memories formed while practicing a newly learned skill. But after looking at brain waves recorded from healthy volunteers in learning and memory experiments at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/&quot;&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;, she started to question the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waves were recorded from right-handed volunteers with a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography. The subjects sat in a chair facing a computer screen and under a long cone-shaped brain scanning cap. The experiment began when they were shown a series of numbers on a screen and asked to type the numbers as many times as possible with their left hands for 10 seconds; take a 10 second break; and then repeat this trial cycle of alternating practice and rest 35 more times. This strategy is typically used to reduce any complications that could arise from fatigue or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, the volunteers’ speed at which they correctly typed the numbers improved dramatically during the first few trials and then leveled off around the 11th cycle. When Dr. Bönstrup looked at the volunteers’ brain waves she observed something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that participants’ brain waves seemed to change much more during the rest periods than during the typing sessions,” said Dr. Bönstrup. “This gave me the idea to look much more closely for when learning was actually happening. Was it during practice or rest?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers’ performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers’ brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers’ brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,” said Dr. Cohen. “Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cohen’s team plans to explore, in greater detail, the role of these early resting periods in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bönstrup et al., A Rapid Form of Offline Consolidation in Skill Learning. Current Biology, March 28, 2019 DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30219-2&quot;&gt;10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.049&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Icons: Avoid temptation and start with user needs</title>
<link>https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/icons-avoid-temptation-and-start-with-user-needs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/icons-avoid-temptation-and-start-with-user-needs</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Icons represent ideas in a simple, visual way. But we must use them carefully, and only where they help people. Users’ needs must come first, and we shouldn’t be afraid to challenge how people use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm an interaction designer working in the team which redesigned the NHS website, previously NHS Choices. Over the years the site had developed lots of different navigation patterns and image styles to address the same user need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning a new language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to throw a few icons on a page. But there are very few that everyone recognises. These include the icons for home, print, and search (the magnifying glass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting a user to understand a non-universal icon is like expecting them to learn a new language. And we know that most people don’t want to or can’t learn new languages easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, icons have their advantages. If they’re quickly recognised, they can be good targets for fingers and mouse cursors and they can overcome language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An icon for every occasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/icons-on-the-nhs-website-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Examples of the various icons on the NHS Choices website&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lack of consistency on the website – there were more than 30 icons, used as navigation, decoration and buttons. Our first task was to audit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what icons existed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what user needs they met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether users understood them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether they were essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether they were accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at the icons’ file formats, styles, sizes, colours and shapes. We also checked if there was any way of measuring their effectiveness with analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We evaluated the 30 icons against two criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;meeting specific user needs or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being essential to the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and reduced the number to 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A set of icons for the NHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided if we were to use icons, they needed to look like they were from the same family. The NHS brand is well established and based on trust, with its distinct blue colour and Frutiger font. We had to be careful about introducing new elements. Rather than using free icons, we decided to create our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had proved through testing that buttons with rounded corners looked more ‘clicky’, so we styled our icons similarly. Our assumption was that icons with rounded corners would stand out among elements such as the NHS logo, which are quite angular and boxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions and testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hamburger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHS Choices used a ‘hamburger’ icon to toggle the menu (the main navigation) but, while hamburgers are used on a lot of websites and apps, they aren’t universally understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/nhs-choices-hamburger-icon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NHS Choices hamburger menu icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the new site, the menu link needed to sit in the new header alongside the NHS logo and search link. If we used the hamburger icon, we also needed a supporting label to be accessible (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation).&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation).');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;see Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.3.3)&lt;/a&gt;. But then we lost the benefits of being simple and visually pleasing. The extra clutter would make it harder for users to scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Menu’ is a simple word and it didn’t fight with the NHS branding. We took it out to test with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that they had no problem navigating to the correct information via the menu and that their interpretation of the word ‘menu’ fits our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/new-nhs-website-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;The new NHS website header&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of our new navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclamation or question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exclamation marks and information icons had been used on the website’s health information pages to help users identify warnings and important content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took some new versions out to test with users in a shopping centre. To our astonishment, a number of users said that they wouldn’t read the information in the boxes. They likened them to advertising on news sites and overlooked them because of the ambiguity of the icon and the ‘READ ME!!!’ look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/infected-blister-smaller-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of warning call out with exclamation icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/vertigo-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of inset text with an i icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found the exclamation icon caused more harm than good. Users who read the boxes misunderstood their importance. Some thought on first glance that the information was more important than emergency ‘call 999’ messaging, which it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we replaced the exclamation with the word ‘important’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/important-blister-even-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of warning callout with the heading of important&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we retested, having ‘Important’ worked for warnings. Users read the information and understood its importance. We’ve since added context-specific, short headings which also test well with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the information icon was also effective. The blue left border worked well in highlighting information without making it appear more important than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/vertigo2-even-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of inset text without icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all icons are bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst we found words more effective on certain components, some icons work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do and Don’t lists have proved to reassure users. The tick and cross icons support the positive and negative statements and highlight information when users scan a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/dos-and-donts-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of do and don’t list&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found arrow icons highlight ‘action’ links for users wanting to find help. They're noticeable but, unlike buttons, users actually read the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/minor-injuries-unit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of action link&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A final set of NHS icons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of lab testing and pop-up sessions we ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/icons&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/icons');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;a set of 11 icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/transformation-blog/final-set-of-icons-smaller.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the final set of 11 NHS icons&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re a great start but it's important to remember that they were tested in specific contexts for specific needs. You should only add icons if research shows there’s something missing. Underpin everything with user research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the icons available in the NHS.UK frontend library in a health context, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:service-manual@nhs.net&quot; onclick=&quot;logGoogleAnalyticsEvent('Link click','General','mailto:service-manual@nhs.net');&quot; onkeyup=&quot;return vjsu.onKeyUp(event)&quot;&gt;please feedback&lt;/a&gt; on how they’re working.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do startups get their content marketing to work?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/13/how-do-startups-actually-get-their-content-marketing-to-work/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;[Editor’s note: this&lt;/span&gt; is a free example of a series of articles we’re publishing by top experts who have cutting-edge startup advice to offer, over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/&quot;&gt;Extra Crunch&lt;/a&gt;. Get in touch at ec_columns@techcrunch.com if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/techcrunch-extra-crunch-is-looking-for-great-startup-guest-authors/&quot;&gt;have ideas to share&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the best growth marketers fail to get content marketing to work. Many are unwittingly using tactics from 4 years ago that no longer work today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post cuts through the noise by sharing real-world data behind some of the biggest SEO successes this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It studies the content marketing performance of clients with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.growthmachine.com/&quot;&gt;Growth Machine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bellcurve.com/&quot;&gt;Bell Curve&lt;/a&gt; (my company) — two marketing agencies who have helped grow Perfect Keto, Tovala, Framer, Crowd Cow, Imperfect Produce, and over a hundred others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What content do their clients write about, how do they optimize that content to rank well (SEO), and how do they convert their readers into customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re about to see how most startups manage their blogs the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cupandleaf.com/blog&quot;&gt;CupAndLeaf.com&lt;/a&gt; as we go along. Their tactics for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/cupandleaf.com&quot;&gt;hitting 150,000 monthly visitors&lt;/a&gt; will be explored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Google wasn’t skilled at identifying and promoting high quality articles. Their algorithms were tricked by low-value, “content farm” posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Google is getting close to delivering on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/&quot;&gt;original mission statement&lt;/a&gt;: “To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” In other words, they now reliably identify high quality articles. How? By monitoring engagement signals: Google can detect when a visitor hits the Back button in their browser. This signals that the reader quickly bounced from the article after they clicked to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this occurs frequently for an article, Google ranks that article lower. It deems it low quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, below is a screenshot of the (old) Google Webmaster Tools interface. It visualizes this quality assessment process: It shows a blog post with the potential to rank for the keyword “design packaging ideas.” Google initially ranked it at position 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since readers weren’t engaging with the content as time went on, Google incrementally ranked the article lower — until it completely fell off the results page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1812399&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;561&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png 1176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_search_analytics.png?resize=50,27 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson? Your objective is to write high quality articles that keep readers engaged. Almost everything else is noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studying our clients, we’ve identified four rules for writing engaging posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Write articles for queries that actually prioritize articles.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all search queries are best served by articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, examine the results for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=personalized+skincare&quot;&gt;personalized skincare&lt;/a&gt;:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-1812398&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;782&quot; height=&quot;1046&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png 782w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png?resize=224,300 224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png?resize=768,1027 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png?resize=508,680 508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_serp.png?resize=37,50 37w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Google is prioritizing quizzes. Not articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you don’t perform a check like this before writing an article on “personalized skincare,” there’s a good chance you’re wasting your time. Because, for some queries, Google has begun prioritizing local recommendations, videos, quizzes, or other types of results that aren’t articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanity check this before you sit down to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Write titles that accurately depict what readers get from the content.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are incoming readers looking to buy a product? Then be sure to show them product links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, were they looking for a recipe? Provide that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your content deliver on what your titles imply a reader will see. Otherwise, readers bounce. Google will then notice the accumulating bounces, and you’ll be penalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Write articles that conclude the searcher’s experience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your objective is to be the last site a visitor visits in their search journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning, if they read your post then don’t look at other Google result, Google infers that your post gave the searcher what they were looking for. And that’s Google’s prime directive: get searchers to their destination through the shortest path possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-part trick for concluding the searcher’s journey is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go sufficiently in-depth to cover all the subtopics they could be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to related posts that may cover the tangential topics they seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clearscope.io/&quot;&gt;Clearscope&lt;/a&gt; for — it ensures we don’t miss critical subtopics that help our posts rank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1812397&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;575&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png 1432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_page.png?resize=50,28 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Write in-depth yet concise content.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, what do most of the top-ranked blogs have in common?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They skip filler introductions, keep their paragraphs short, and get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to make navigation seamless, they employ a “table of contents” experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1812396&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png?resize=768,313 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png?resize=680,278 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_keto.png?resize=50,20 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be like them, and get out of the reader’s way. All our best-performing blogs do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out more articles by Julian Shapiro over on Extra Crunch, including “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/extra-crunch-whats-the-cost-of-buying-users-from-facebook-and-the-other-ad-networks/&quot;&gt;What’s the cost of buying users from Facebook and 13 other ad networks?&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/which-types-of-startups-are-most-often-profitable/&quot;&gt;Which types of startups are most often profitable&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In going through our data, the second major learning was about “backlinks”, which is marketing jargon for a link to your site from someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, the SEO community was focused on backlinks and Domain Ranking (DR) — an indication of how many quality sites link to yours (scored from 0 to 100). At the time, they were right to be concerned about backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, our data reveals that backlinks don’t matter as much as they used to. They certainly help, but you need great content behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most content marketers haven’t caught up to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a screenshot showing how small publishers can beat out large behemoths today — with very little Domain Ranking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1812395&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;863&quot; height=&quot;557&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png 863w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/startup_marketing_analytics.png?resize=50,32 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication is that, even without backlinks, Google is still happy to rank you highly. Consider this: They don’t need your site to be linked from TechCrunch for their algorithm to determine whether visitors are engaged on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember: Google has Google Analytics, Google Search, Google Ads, and Google Chrome data to monitor how searchers engage with your site. Believe me, if they want to find out whether your content is engaging, they can find a way. They don’t need backlinks to tell them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that backlinks are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data shows they still provide value, just much less. Notably, they get your pages “considered” by Google sooner: If you have backlinks from authoritative and relevant sites, Google will have the confidence to send test traffic to your pages in perhaps a few weeks instead of in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I mean by “test traffic:” In the weeks after publishing your post, Google notices them then experimentally surfaces them at the top of related search terms. They then monitor whether searchers engage with the content (i.e. don’t quickly hit their Back button). If the engagement is engaging, they’ll increasingly surface your articles. And increase your rankings over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having good backlinks can cut this process down from months to a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement isn’t your end goal. It’s the precursor to what ultimately matters: getting a signup, subscribe, or purchase. (Marketers call this your “conversion event.”) Visitors can take a few paths to your conversion event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short: They read the initial post then immediately convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium: They read the initial post plus a few more before eventually converting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long (most common): They subscribe to your newsletter and/or return later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase the ratio at which readers take the short and medium paths, optimize your blog posts’ copy, design, and calls to action. We’ve identified two rules for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Naturally segue to your pitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data shows you should not pitch your product until the back half of your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Pitching yourself in the intro can taint the authenticity of your article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the further a reader gets into a good article, the more familiarity and trust they’ll accrue for your brand, which means they’re less likely to ignore your pitch once they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Don’t make your pitch look like an ad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blogs make their product pitches look like big, show-stopping banner ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data shows this visual fanfare is reflexively ignored by readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, plug your product using a normal text link — styled no differently than any other link in your post. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woodpath.com/guide/a-complete-guide-to-the-sibo-diet&quot;&gt;Woodpath&lt;/a&gt;, a health blog with Amazon products to pitch, does this well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, our best-performing clients focus less on their Google Analytics data and more on their readers’ full journeys: They encourage readers to provide their email so they can follow up with a series of “drip” emails. Ideally, these build trust in the brand and get visitors to eventually convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They “retarget” readers with ads. This entails pitching them with ads for the products that are most relevant to the topics they read on the blog. (Facebook and Instagram provide the granular control necessary to segment traffic like this.) You can read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/intro&quot;&gt;growth marketing handbook&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about running retargeting ads well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why retargeting is high-leverage: In running Facebook and Instagram ads for over a hundred startups, we’ve found that the cost of a retargeting purchase is one third the cost of a purchase from ads shown to people who haven’t yet been to our site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data shows that clients who earn nothing from their blog traffic can sometimes earn thousands by simply retargeting ads to their readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible for a blog with 50,000 monthly visitors to earn nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, prioritize visitor engagement over volume: Make your hero metrics your revenue per visitor and your total revenue. That’ll keep your eye on the intermediary goals that matter: Attracting visitors with an intent to convert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping those visitors engaged on the site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then compelling them to convert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, your goal is to help Google do its job: Get readers where they need to go with the least amount of friction in their way.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Even the best growth marketers fail to get content marketing to work. Many are unwittingly using tactics from 4 years ago that no longer work today.</og:description>

<title>Learn TLA+ (2018)</title>
<link>https://learntla.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://learntla.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-tla&quot;&gt;What is TLA+?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLA+ is a &lt;em&gt;formal specification language&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a tool to design systems and algorithms, then programmatically verify that those systems don’t have critical bugs. It’s the software equivalent of a blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-i-use-it&quot;&gt;Why should I use it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple TLA+ specification, representing people trading unique items. Can you find the bug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-tla&quot; data-lang=&quot;tla&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;People&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;alice&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;bob&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;ore&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;sheep&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;brick&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;(* --algorithm trade&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner_of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;[Items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;process&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;giveitem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\* up to three possible trades made&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Items,&lt;/span&gt; 
          &lt;span&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner_of[item],&lt;/span&gt; 
          &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;origin_of_trade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;\in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Give:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;origin_of_trade&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span&gt;owner_of[item]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;end process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;end algorithm; *)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we check that the owner of an item is the one trading it away, we should be safe against scams, right? But if we run the model checker, we find that’s not true: Alice could trade an item to &lt;em&gt;herself&lt;/em&gt; and, before that process finishes running, resolve a parallel trade giving that same item to Bob. Then the first trade resolves and Alice gets the item back. Our algorithm fails for race conditions, and we know this because TLA+ explored every possible state and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few different ways of fixing this. But does our fix work for more than two people? In TLA+, checking that is as simple as &lt;code&gt;People == {&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;eve&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;. Does it work if we can trade multiple items at once? &lt;code&gt;variable items \in SUBSET Items&lt;/code&gt;. What about if there’s multiple sheep, ore, and bricks? &lt;code&gt;amount_owned = [People \X Items -&amp;gt; 0..5]&lt;/code&gt;. What if three people are all trading 1 ore and 1 sheep with each of the other players while Eve also trades Alice 0 brick? If it’s in the possible state space, TLA+ will check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-it-hard-to-use&quot;&gt;Is it hard to use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formal methods have a reputation for being difficult to the point where they’re only worth it for critical systems. This means that all of the guides are written under the assumption that the reader is working on a critical system, where they have to know TLA+ inside and out to make absolutely sure that their system won’t accidentally &lt;em&gt;kill people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dangerous bug to you is “somebody dies”, then yes, formal methods are hard. If a dangerous bug to you is “nobody dies but our customers get really mad and we have to spend two weeks tracking down and fixing the bug”, then the small subset of TLA+ you’ll need is actually pretty easy to learn. Just find a beginner-friendly guide and you’re all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-s-a-beginner-friendly-guide&quot;&gt;Where’s a beginner-friendly guide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! This guide covers the basics of TLA+ in an easy, hands-on way. If you want to start from the beginning, you can learn more about what we’ll cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntla.com/introduction/about-this-guide&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to dive in right away, why not try a &lt;a href=&quot;https://learntla.com/introduction/example&quot;&gt;whirlwind tour&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, welcome to TLA+!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Org-mode parser in Rust</title>
<link>https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ngortheone/org-rs</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt; parser re-write in Rust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;! Warning, this project is in early development !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best and most complete plain text organizational system known to mankind. It has countless applications like authoring, publishing, task and time tracking, journal, blog, agenda, wiki etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Org was originally developed for Emacs and therefore available only inside Emacs. It is a huge limiting factor for Org's development and popularization. Because of that it is not as popular outside of Emacs community as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many attempts were made to fix this. It all starts with a parser. But because Org's syntax is not trivial and in fact most of it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-1_grammars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;context-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; with only a few context-free elements, it is quite easy to get it wrong. Some Org parsers have chosen to focus on a restricted subset of Org's syntax like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby&quot;&gt;org-ruby&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. More ambitious projects try to cover all features but since Org does not have a formal specification&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; they rely on observed Org's behavior in Emacs or author's intuition. As a result they rarely get finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the absence of a good a spec and the complexity of the grammar are not show stoppers. Why reinventing the wheel when we can just copy it! This project takes the only surefire way to get it right - use the original elisp parser implementation as a blueprint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be fast. Speed matters. Period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be feature-complete, compliant with original implementation. Nobody wants Nth competing standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be standalone, embeddable and reusable. User must not be locked into one particular editor or ecosystem. Integrations with language servers, editors and plugins should be encouraged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the choices that were made to achieve the goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust. Because it is fast, memory safe and provides C FFI. And most importantly it is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rope&lt;/a&gt; as underlying data structure that provides O(log n) updates. &lt;a href=&quot;http://abishov.com/xi-editor/docs/rope_science_00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xi-rope&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome implementation from xi-editor project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original elisp algorithm. While using the original elisp source as a guideline might result in less idiomatic Rust code it has its advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope of work is well-defined and finish line is visible. This should encourage contributions even from people who want to get started with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting &quot;feature-complete&quot; is just a matter of getting to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs/blob/master/rust/element&quot;&gt;element&lt;/a&gt; - parser crate is currently the main and only focus. It should perform just 2 tasks. Generate concrete syntax tree and serialize it back to canonical Org representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the roadmap is not fully flashed out. Feature-complete parser opens a lot of possibilities, here are just a few of my ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parse tree manipulation tools (like exporting to other formats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language server - &lt;a href=&quot;https://langserver.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a way to solve &quot;the matrix&quot; problem&lt;/a&gt;. Enabling other editors to have their own org-mode would be a logical next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLI tools. I'd love to get integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior&quot;&gt;TaskWarrior&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even use Org as TaskWarrior's DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any contributions are welcome. If you want to help check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Footnote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some attempts were made to formalize the syntax. This project uses them as supplementary materials. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Which programming language is used for making Windows 10?</title>
<link>https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Windows 10 is the same (evolved) code base as the code base of Windows 8.x, 7, Vista, XP, 2000, and NT, where each generation saw significant refactoring, and added substantial new features, improved performance and hardware support as well as security, all while maintaining a very high degree of backward compatibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Most of the kernel (ntoskrnl.exe) is written in the C programming language. You can find leaked copies of the Windows Research Kernel even on Github&lt;a id=&quot;cite-iRMiY&quot; href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1#iRMiY&quot; class=&quot;citation_link&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself: although quite dated and largely incomplete, this code should give significant insights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;See for example the source code that implements the familiar Registry, a kernel component known internally as the configuration manager, “Cm”, in &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2?files=1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;wrk-v1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2/tree/master/base&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2/tree/master/base/ntos&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;ntos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;config&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Most of what runs in kernel mode is also written in the C programming language (most file systems, networking, most drivers…) with some C++ here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;As you go up the stack towards user mode, and towards more recent developments, you’ll find somewhat less C and somewhat more C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;As a side note, what most people don’t realize is the sheer size of Windows: this is a gigantic project of truly epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The full source tree with all the code, test code and everything that together constitutes the “Windows source code” is more than a half terabyte in size, in more than 4 million files. You can spend a year (seriously) just drilling down the source tree, more than a half million folders containing the code for every component making up the OS workstation and server products and all their editions, tools, and associated developement kits, and see what’s in there, read the file names and try to figure out what does what. It would take a life (or two) to read it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Below is a screenshot which may or may not depict statistics about a full Windows enlistment (source code, test files, build tools, everything)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed&quot; src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-be4162100bd9e3ed8411bbd6cff8b9e1&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3155a0ab149196c65a933ea28b0f320b&quot; master_w=&quot;664&quot; master_h=&quot;216&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;One one occasion, I left a Git branch stall for a few weeks and, when I got back to it, it was behind by almost 60,000 commits. I think one can argue that a single person cannot possibly read all the code that is added to Windows every day, let alone read what was written during the past thirty years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;Back to our topic, if you look at a Windows 10 “DVD” and consider what programming languages were used to create everything that’s on that disk, my guess is that 98% of it would be C and C++, with C getting the lion’s share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start&quot;&gt;The .NET BCL and other managed libraries &amp;amp; frameworks that ship inbox are typically written in C#, but they only represent tiny drops in a giant sea of C code with a few islands of C++. They also come from a different division (the developper’s division, DevDiv) and their code is not part of the Windows source tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;qtext_citation_lead&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;citation&quot; id=&quot;iRMiY&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-used-for-making-Windows-10/answer/Axel-Rietschin?share=1#cite-iRMiY&quot; class=&quot;citation_index&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markjandrews/wrk-v1.2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 95533389);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;github.com&quot;&gt;markjandrews/wrk-v1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
