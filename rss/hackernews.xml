&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Baird and his wife, Nichole, say they've had to decide between making their car payment and buying food since she lost her job in the pandemic.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are skipping payments on mortgages, auto loans and other bills. Normally, that could mean massive foreclosures, evictions, cars repossessions and people's credit getting destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But much of that has been put on pause. Help from Congress and leniency from lenders have kept impending financial disaster at bay for millions of people. But that may not last for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that these efforts aim to create a financial bridge to the future for people who've lost their income in the pandemic — but the bridge is only half-built. For one thing, the help still isn't reaching many people who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My wife has filed, certified every week for her unemployment for 10 weeks now, and they have done nothing,&quot; says Jonathan Baird of Bruceton, Tenn. &quot;We've struggled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res867962980&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage843547334&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/04/27/843547334/3-4-million-homeowners-skip-payments-but-many-are-scared-say-congress-needs-to-a&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/04\/27\/843547334\/3-4-million-homeowners-skip-payments-but-many-are-scared-say-congress-needs-to-a&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/04/24/_r6a3832_sq-8bb4f4c53f0f04b7da7a05fc2f64411796de47b9-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/04/24/_r6a3832_sq-8bb4f4c53f0f04b7da7a05fc2f64411796de47b9-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;3.4 Million Homeowners Skip Payments. But Many Are Scared, Say Congress Needs To Act&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baird is a disabled veteran who gets a small disability pension. When the pandemic hit, his wife lost her job as a home health aide. That was most of their income. And like many other contract workers, she has run into long delays trying to collect unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Baird says his mortgage company told him that he didn't qualify for a federal program to postpone payments. Many homeowners have been given wrong or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/04/27/843547334/3-4-million-homeowners-skip-payments-but-many-are-scared-say-congress-needs-to-a&quot;&gt;misleading information from lenders&lt;/a&gt; about that. And it appears that is what happened in Baird's case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baird also called Ford to try to get a break on the payments for his pickup truck. &quot;When I contacted them, they told me that there was nothing they could do,&quot; he says. &quot;Just basically make your payment or suffer the late fees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says a call center worker told him that he didn't qualify for any help because he was late on a car payment last year. When NPR contacted Ford, the company said that is not its policy. And after reviewing the case, the company is now letting Baird skip his next car payment, which he says is a big help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're paycheck to paycheck like most people,&quot; he says. &quot;And when you take away that paycheck, especially for this length of time, we have to make the decision — a vehicle or food.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford says the company is allowing many customers hurt financially during the pandemic-related shutdowns to skip payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res868198964&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;

Here's What You Need To Know&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And millions of people are getting help from all kinds of lenders. According to the latest available numbers from the credit bureau TransUnion, about 3 million auto loans and 15 million credit card accounts are in some kind of program to let people skip or make partial payments. Those are probably low estimates. According to the analytics company Black Knight, 4.75 million homeowners — or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackknightinc.com/black-knight-4-75-million-homeowners-now-in-covid-19-related-forbearance-plans-nearly-half-made-april-mortgage-payments/&quot;&gt;9% of all mortgages&lt;/a&gt; — have entered into forbearance plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers don't want these delayed payments to hurt credit scores. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text#H1274B87B2B204ACA95F8C0D8228925C2&quot;&gt;Congress mandated&lt;/a&gt; that people who were current on their payments before the outbreak should still be reported as current on their payments while in a hardship program. And that appears to working for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we're seeing consistently across the board is actually credit scores are moving upward,&quot; says Matthew Komos, a vice president at TransUnion. He says that's both on a month-to-month and year-over-year basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage855217217&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855217217/7-year-no-interest-loans-what-it-takes-to-sell-cars-in-a-pandemic&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/05\/13\/855217217\/7-year-no-interest-loans-what-it-takes-to-sell-cars-in-a-pandemic&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/05/13/ap_20129805259573_sq-85b2e1155108befae4ad291dd79a0c6aac214a47-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/05/13/ap_20129805259573_sq-85b2e1155108befae4ad291dd79a0c6aac214a47-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;7-Year No-Interest Loans: What It Takes To Sell Cars In A Pandemic&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking ahead, advocates say people could run into big trouble because the terms of these hardship programs can be all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Credit cards, auto loans, installment loans, there are no federal guidelines,&quot; says Aracely Panameño, a director at the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says when it comes time to make up for all those skipped payments, there are federal rules for repayment plans for home mortgages but not for many other types of loans. So she says lawmakers need to protect people. Otherwise, she says, lenders could make demands beyond what people can afford. &quot;You must have a capacity to catch up with your payments in an affordable way,&quot; Panameño says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Chi Wu with the National Consumer Law Center agrees. Without better protections, when it comes time to make up for the missed payments, &quot;there's going to be a lot of people who could experience massive credit reporting harm,&quot; says Wu, an attorney focusing on consumer credit issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the rules for mortgages, consumer advocates say the vast majority of people hurt financially during the outbreak who entered a forbearance plan should have their missed payments moved to the end of the loan term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That keeps monthly payments the same as they were before and just extends the amount of time to pay the loan. Some other types of lenders are using this approach. Ford tells NPR it is taking missed payments and moving them to the end of the auto loan term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res868188700&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage867135561&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867135561/it-s-like-a-nightmare-options-dwindle-for-renters-facing-economic-distress&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/06\/01\/867135561\/it-s-like-a-nightmare-options-dwindle-for-renters-facing-economic-distress&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/06/01/gettyimages-1215964695_sq-94290d83009a6e2933c84022032154c4c39d5a58-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/06/01/gettyimages-1215964695_sq-94290d83009a6e2933c84022032154c4c39d5a58-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;'It's Like A Nightmare': Options Dwindle For Renters Facing Economic Distress&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their part, many lenders say that to keep helping people, they need a government conduit through which to borrow money themselves. Bill Himpler is president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, which represents lenders who make car loans, personal loans and mortgages and offer credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we can't keep the lights on because things have seized up, it's not good for anybody,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not good for the customer; it's not good for the company; it's not good for the economy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big thing lawmakers need to resolve is whether to extend the federal government's expanded unemployment benefits. Getting that unemployment money is the biggest reason most people who've lost jobs are able to pay rent and keep a roof over their heads. And while some people are going back to work, many others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the $600-a-week unemployment insurance runs out at the end of July, most people expect tremendous displacement risk,&quot; says Andrew Jakabovics with the affordable housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners. &quot;Evictions are likely to go through the roof.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res868188796&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage855537571&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/05/19/855537571/are-you-ready-to-go-back-to-work-share-your-story&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/05\/19\/855537571\/are-you-ready-to-go-back-to-work-share-your-story&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/05/13/npr-callout-graphic_sq-5123dba62b4dd173935205722266b22de3ac84c5-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/05/13/npr-callout-graphic_sq-5123dba62b4dd173935205722266b22de3ac84c5-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Are You Ready To Go Back To Work? Share Your Story&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with eviction moratoriums expiring in parts of the country, he says action is needed right away to help people who can't pay the rent as the pandemic drags on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as with many other aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, there are disparities along socioeconomic and racial lines. Panameño says her group did a national survey to see who was having trouble paying their bills after the pandemic struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Twenty-five percent of Latinos had already fallen behind with their payments,&quot; she says. &quot;Twenty-eight percent of African Americans had fallen behind. That compares to 12% of whites that had fallen behind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>German city wants to ditch Microsoft for Linux</title>
<link>https://androidrookies.com/this-german-city-wants-to-ditch-microsoft-for-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://androidrookies.com/this-german-city-wants-to-ditch-microsoft-for-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;This German city wants to replace Microsoft with Linux and other open-source alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Munich, now Hamburg city from Germany wants to replace Microsoft with Linux and other open-source software. The migration from Microsoft software to open-source alternatives comes with a series of benefits, including reduced licensing costs and better local control over the code powering the whole thing, and this is one of the reasons some authorities across the world are looking into such a transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Greens announced via Twitter from the 13th round of talks on coalition formation that an “entry into Microsoft’s exit” had been agreed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In administration, more emphasis should be placed on open source products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, more software should be developed in-house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dedicated AI project is also planned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is about becoming a “role model in digital sovereignty”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The SPD said it did not want to become “one-sidedly dependent”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mgbot_20&quot;&gt;There are positive reactions from the state of Schleswig-Holstein. In 2018, the decision was made to push open-source in administration. Now the neighbors have been “infected”, the green digital minister Jan-Philipp Albrecht suspects with a wink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Hamburg isn’t sure about the transition will be full or partial. If what Hamburg is planning is a complete switch to open source, then Linux could take the place of Windows as part of a gradual move or just a partial transition that would have the city replace software like the Microsoft Office productivity suite with alternatives like LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear about what the city will decide but it is has been sure that Microsoft will be replaced with some of the other open-source software. What is your view on this matter?

<title>Huawei hid business operation in Iran after Reuters reported links to CFO</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies acted to cover up its relationship with a firm that had tried to sell prohibited U.S. computer gear to Iran, after Reuters in 2013 reported deep links between the firm and the telecom-equipment giant’s chief financial officer, newly obtained internal Huawei documents show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FILE PHOTO: Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada May 27, 2020. REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei has long described the firm - Skycom Tech Co Ltd - as a separate local business partner in Iran. Now, documents obtained by Reuters show how the Chinese tech titan effectively controlled Skycom. The documents, reported here for the first time, are part of a trove of internal Huawei and Skycom Iran-related business records - including memos, letters and contractual agreements - that Reuters has reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One document described how Huawei scrambled in early 2013 to try to “separate” itself from Skycom out of concern over trade sanctions on Tehran. To that end, this and other documents show, Huawei took a series of actions - including changing the managers of Skycom, shutting down Skycom’s Tehran office and forming another business in Iran to take over tens of millions of dollars worth of Skycom contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations in the new documents could buttress a high-profile criminal case being pursued by U.S. authorities against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of Huawei’s founder. The United States has been trying to get Meng extradited from Canada, where she was arrested in December 2018. A Canadian judge last week allowed the case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. indictment alleges that Huawei and Meng participated in a fraudulent scheme to obtain prohibited U.S. goods and technology for Huawei’s Iran-based business via Skycom, and move money out of Iran by deceiving a major bank. The indictment alleges that Skycom was an “unofficial subsidiary” of Huawei, not a local partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei and Meng have denied the criminal charges, which include bank fraud, wire fraud and other allegations. Skycom, which was registered in Hong Kong and was dissolved in 2017, is also a defendant. At one point, Huawei was a shareholder in Skycom but, according to corporate filings, sold its stake more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly obtained documents appear to undermine Huawei’s claims that Skycom was just a business partner. They offer a behind-the-scenes look at some of what transpired at the two companies inside Iran seven years ago and how intertwined the companies were. The documents are variously written in English, Chinese and Farsi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s foreign ministry said the United States was politicizing economic and trade issues, which is not in the interest of Chinese or American firms. “We urge the United States to immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese firms including Huawei,” it said. It referred specific questions about this story to Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘NORMAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported in March that Huawei had produced internal company records in 2010, including two packing lists, that showed it was directly involved in sending prohibited U.S. computer equipment to Iran. Huawei declined to comment on that story, citing ongoing legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To read the March report, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iran-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-newly-obtained-documents-show-huawei-role-in-shipping-prohibited-u-s-gear-to-iran-idUSKBN20P1VA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly obtained documents show that Huawei’s efforts to obscure its relationship with Skycom began after Reuters reported in December 2012 that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator in late 2010. In January 2013, a second Reuters report described how Huawei had close financial ties and other links to Skycom, including the fact that Meng had served on Skycom’s board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To read the December 2012 report, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its response at the time to the Reuters reporting, Huawei said Skycom was one of its “major local partners” and that the relationship between Huawei and Skycom was “a normal business partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a newly obtained Huawei internal document from the Chinese company’s Iran office, dated March 28, 2013, indicates Huawei controlled Skycom. The document in Chinese stated: “In consideration of trade compliances, A2 representative office is trying to separate Skycom and Huawei.” A2 was Huawei’s code for Iran, according to the U.S. indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document also noted that Huawei had installed one of its own employees to manage Skycom in Iran “to urgently avoid the risks of media hype.” Huawei had made an “urgent decision” to appoint Hu Mei as Skycom’s general manager in Iran, effective March 10, 2013, the document noted. Hu was a director of Skycom and was also listed as a Huawei employee in an internal Huawei directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document detailed how Huawei quickly recognized a flaw in putting Hu in charge of Skycom. Hu was based at Huawei’s headquarters in China, and the job required dealing with business matters on the ground in Iran, the document stated. So, Huawei decided to appoint instead “a Chinese employee based in Iran” to manage Skycom’s Tehran office, the document shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei decided to name Song Kai, deputy representative of its Iran office, to run Skycom in Iran. He was informed of the decision in an internal Huawei message that was reviewed by Reuters. “Please update your resume,” Song was instructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message said that the change had been approved by a man named Lan Yun, who was identified as the “chief representative” of Huawei’s Iran office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hu, Song and Lan couldn’t be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POWERPOINT PRESENTATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the Reuters articles of 2012 and 2013, several Western banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. They included HSBC Holdings PLC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2013, Meng met with HSBC’s deputy head of global banking for the Asia-Pacific region. She is accused in the U.S. indictment of making “numerous misrepresentations regarding Huawei’s ownership and control of Skycom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meng gave a PowerPoint presentation during the meeting that said Skycom was merely “a business partner of Huawei.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly obtained documents show that Huawei soon became directly involved in shutting Skycom down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter dated Nov. 2, 2013, Song, the Huawei employee appointed to manage Skycom, told a major Iranian client that Skycom “has decided to annul and terminate its business activities and dissolve the branch company in Iran.” Song’s letter was addressed to a vice president of Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator, Mobile Communication Co of Iran, or MCCI.&lt;/p&gt;

It stated that Skycom planned to transfer its contracts to the new Huawei entity. The agreement listed eight contracts worth a total of 44.6 million euros (about $50 million), with about 34.6 million euros remaining on them. Any money owed to Skycom was to be paid to the Huawei entity upon completion of the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Secretly Recorded Phone Calls, Officers Say Innocent People Were Framed</title>
<link>https://gothamist.com/news/mount-vernon-police-tapes-innocent-people-were-framed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gothamist.com/news/mount-vernon-police-tapes-innocent-people-were-framed</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In hours of secretly recorded telephone conversations, police officers in Mount Vernon, New York, reveal widespread corruption, brutality and other misconduct in the troubled Westchester County city just north of the Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught on tape by a whistleblower cop, the officers said they witnessed or took part in alarming acts of police misconduct, from framing and beating residents to collaborating with drug dealers, all as part of a culture of impunity within the department’s narcotics unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mount Vernon police tapes, obtained exclusively by Gothamist/WNYC, were recorded from 2017 to this year by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/black-cop-says-his-boss-called-him-rat-exposing-corruption-here-are-his-secret-recordings&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Murashea Bovell&lt;/a&gt;, a 12-year veteran of the department who has been blowing the whistle on misconduct for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and 2015, Bovell reported his colleagues’ alleged corruption and brutality in confidential complaints to the city and a lawsuit against the city, which was dismissed on procedural grounds. But he saw little change, so he began quietly recording his colleagues to substantiate his own claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need to have something tangible,” he told Gothamist/WNYC. “Something to prove that what I was saying is true, and wouldn’t fall on deaf ears if the time came.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tapes are just the latest in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/mountvernon/politics/mayoral-mayhem-may-be-over-richard-thomas-moves-out-of-mount-vernon-office/773163/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2019/12/16/lawrence-porcari-mount-vernon-guilty-corruption/4417860002/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackwestchester.com/2326/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public corruption scandals&lt;/a&gt; that have rocked the city in recent years. The police department itself has gone through at least five different commissioners since 2015. Bovell sued the city again last year, alleging retaliation for his activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, city spokesman Daniel Terry promised authorities would investigate the accusations thoroughly, but cautioned that there are two sides to every story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that the truth will come out, and I’d ask people to withhold judgment until it does,” he said. He said he could not comment further on a case in litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to George Joseph's report on WNYC:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recordings also raise questions about the response by Westchester District Attorney Anthony Scarpino, a former FBI agent and judge who is a Mount Vernon native and began his legal career there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovell turned over a batch of recordings to Scarpino’s office in February of 2019. But nine months later, after some initial signs of interest, a DA investigator confirmed that the agency had not moved forward with the investigation, according to Joseph Murray, Bovell’s attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarpino’s office insisted that an investigation is ongoing, but declined to comment on the investigator’s communications to Bovell and his attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clearly we have investigated this and are investigating this, so I’m not sure what that means,” First Deputy District Attorney Paul Noto said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovell said he decided to share his tapes now because he does not believe authorities are willing to root out corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve taken the proper steps, protocols, to let city leaders, police department leaders know what was happening. Nothing happened. Even brought it to the District Attorney,” he said. “So now, [the] only option left is to let the public know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2/ Here's active duty Mount Vernon Officer John Campo. He said his narcotics unit colleagues planted drugs, falsified search warrants, and got undercover officers to identify the wrong suspects. He asked the whistleblower not to tell anyone: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Abk16XVE80&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Abk16XVE80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s On The Tapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Valentine’s Day in 2019, Bovell mailed the Westchester County District Attorney’s Office an unusual gift: a USB stick with secret recordings of his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had several conversations with John Campo, a Mount Vernon police officer who first joined the force in 2010. In one of the calls, Campo complained to Bovell that he was facing possible discipline after he tested positive for marijuana use. But he said others in the narcotics unit had gotten away with far worse. Campo was particularly upset about the actions of a detective with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/corruption-and-brutality-allegations-against-mount-vernon-detective-are-echoed-civilian-complaints&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aggressive reputation&lt;/a&gt; named Camilo Antonini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officer told Bovell that Antonini worked with an undercover officer from “the county police” to frame civilians after undercover drug buys “on numerous occasions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally in these operations, an undercover officer buys drugs from a dealer, then identifies the dealer by confirming the suspect’s face in a photo array. But during his time in Mount Vernon’s narcotics unit, Campo claimed, Antonini would push an undercover officer from the county to identify “the wrong suspects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campo did not offer any specific motive for this allegation. But in the calls he does say that the narcotics unit gave preferential treatment to favored city drug dealers. Similarly, in his 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JsCTxaD7Z3So7w6u41emTkqy81Or827T/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Bovell accused Antonini specifically of collaborating inappropriately with favored drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So they’re going to indict people on whatever fucking fake charges or whatever the fuck it is that don’t deserve to be indicted, because they weren’t even the right person he bought from, and ‘Nini forced him to sign it,” Campo said in the call, referring to Antonini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Vernon residents have previously accused Antonini and fellow narcotics officers of corruption and brutality, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/corruption-and-brutality-allegations-against-mount-vernon-detective-are-echoed-civilian-complaints&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confidential police documents&lt;/a&gt;. But police superiors have almost always dismissed these allegations in those cases reviewed by Gothamist/WNYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached by phone, Antonini declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent call recorded in February of 2018, in which Bovell says he handed to prosecutors this year, Campo claimed that he gave a three-page memo to two different commissioners, outlining numerous acts of misconduct he had witnessed. His allegations include planting drugs, illegal home entries and fabricated search warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campo told Bovell that the commissioners referred him to the FBI, and he met with a couple of agents. But the officer said he was unwilling to go further with them because he did not want to wear a wire or take a polygraph test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached by phone, Campo declined to comment for this story. The FBI also declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February of 2019, Bovell said he also mailed the DA’s office a call with Avion Lee, a Mount Vernon police officer who claimed that her supervisor had instructed subordinates to make up a drug allegation in order to justify an incident of police brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the call, the officer said she and her colleagues were walking the streets when they approached a young man who started to run. Some of the officers gave chase and he kept running. When she caught up to them, she said, the suspect had been beaten so badly she thought he had a broken jaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police took the man to jail, and then concocted a story “to make it look like not what it is,” Lee said. To justify the encounter, she said, their sergeant told them to say they had seen a “hand-to-hand” —a drug transaction — but did not find any drugs in the area after the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man spent the night in jail, but prosecutors dropped the case the next day, she claimed. “The DA said ‘No, of course not. You guys have nothing.’ It was a false arrest,” she told Bovell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee did not respond to Gothamist/WNYC’s requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovell’s first batch of recordings landed in the lap of Thomas Drake, an investigator for the Westchester County District Attorney’s office, on February 19, 2019, according to a text message he sent Bovell. On March 4, 2019, Drake texted Bovell saying that he had listened to some of them. The whistleblower recalls being hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I gave them that information, and I thought this is it. Something big, positive will happen,” Bovell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nine months later, at a meeting with Bovell and his attorney, Joseph Murray, at the DA’s office, Drake told them that the probe had not moved forward because they had been expecting Bovell to send more recordings, according to both men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovell gave them more recordings in February of this year, and they say they haven’t heard anything since. Both Drake and the DA’s office declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;o-caption__text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Westchester County DA Anthony Scarpino&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/WestchesterDA.NY/photos/a.1729932710412270/3158692800869580/?type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Prosecutors Disclosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/brady_rule&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constitutional obligation&lt;/a&gt; to disclose information to defendants that could help establish their innocence. But there’s a big debate in criminal justice circles about when police misconduct allegations in unrelated cases fall under that requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the officers accused of criminal activities and misconduct in the recordings have made hundreds of arrests over their careers in Mount Vernon and other parts of Westchester County. In other cities, such as Philadelphia and Baltimore, recent corruption investigations into police narcotics and gun units have led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/NREMassExonConf4418.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dozens of convictions&lt;/a&gt; being overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But court records show that in the months after Scarpino’s office got the Mount Vernon tapes, it quietly moved forward with dozens of cases involving accused officers, several of which sent people to prison based on the officer’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The DA’s office never disclosed to us any of the recordings or allegations or any indication as to what was going on,” said Clare Degnan, executive director of the Westchester County Legal Aid Society, which had several cases involving officers accused of misconduct on the tapes. “We will be looking at our prior cases to see if there’s a basis to reverse the convictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notto, the first deputy DA, argued such disclosures would have been premature because the investigation is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we would describe as an uncorroborated hearsay allegation is not necessarily something that’s been substantiated, and if it’s not substantiated we don’t necessarily disclose it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said anyone who thinks they were wrongfully convicted can file a complaint with the DA’s office for a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor who worked in Westchester County, criticized the DA’s decision to keep prosecuting people while waiting to see what came of the corruption investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do you undo the harm of having been prosecuted? Detained? Lost your job? Lost time with your family?” said Bragg, who is supporting Scarpino’s opponent in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/mount-vernon-mayor-promises-review-controversial-detective&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Democratic primary&lt;/a&gt; later this month. “Where does that get calculated into this assessment when you say, ‘We’ll deal with it all in a year and a half?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damon Jones, a police reform activist and publisher of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FBlackWestchester.com&amp;amp;v=3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BlackWestchester.com&lt;/a&gt;, argued that the DA’s actions cannot be separated from the fact that Mount Vernon is one of Westchester’s few majority-black cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t care,” he said. “They wouldn’t do this in Scarsdale or any other community, but they continue to do this to people in Mount Vernon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notto, the first deputy district attorney, dismissed this criticism. “We handle every case the same no matter where it emanates from,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember2967646&quot; class=&quot;o-figure__image ember-view&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/306159/fill-634x423/&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Henderson Clarke, accused of a drug sale in Mount Vernon, stands outside his mother’s apartment.&quot; width=&quot;634&quot; height=&quot;423&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o-icon o-icon--dashed-arrow u-icon--s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Henderson Clarke, accused of a drug sale in Mount Vernon, stands outside his mother’s apartment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o-credit&quot;&gt;George Joseph / WNYC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henderson Clarke’s Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of 2018, Richard Thomas, the mayor of Mount Vernon at the time, stood at a podium in City Hall to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=601079950246470&amp;amp;ref=watch_permalink&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announce&lt;/a&gt; the arrests of twenty-two suspected drug dealers across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These people behind us are heroes,” said Thomas, pointing to a row of police officers standing on a staircase in matching blue jackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them, Detective Camilo Antonini, had played a major role in the operation, scoring numerous arrests and signing off on several felony complaints. He stood tall and gazed at the camera. A gold badge rested on his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They went and made sure they found these people, they did their research, they had a year long operation, and they cracked down on at least twenty-two,” the mayor continued. “And there’s a few more they are zeroing in on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henderson Clarke, a New Rochelle resident, was one of the suspects who remained at large. In a criminal complaint, Antonini swore that Clarke sold drugs to an undercover officer at the address of a gas station in Mount Vernon the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outside, the case did not look good for Clarke. He had a history of dealing, and after the May 2018 announcement the then 41-year old failed to come in voluntarily. Police eventually arrested him over a year later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke says he was innocent and that he was not going to turn himself in for a false charge. In the years before his arrest, he had turned his life around, he claimed, holding down jobs at a group home and a moving company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was on my way. Bringing in regular checks, getting taxes taken out from my money, feeling great about my change,” he said. “And then this ghost charge comes out of nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke said he was in North Carolina on the day of crime, July 26, 2017. The day before, Clarke said he and his girlfriend had taken a Greyhound hundreds of miles down south to his brother’s house. He has Instagram posts of his brother’s house and bus receipts that support his story. His browser history from that day shows a Google search misspelling the name of a restaurant, made from somewhere near Smithfield, North Carolina, just after 6 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember2967657&quot; class=&quot;o-figure__image ember-view&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/306160/fill-634x360/&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Clarke provided the court Instagram posts and bus tickets seen here to show he was in North Carolina.&quot; width=&quot;634&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o-icon o-icon--dashed-arrow u-icon--s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clarke provided the court Instagram posts and bus tickets to show he was in North Carolina.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o-credit&quot;&gt;Henderson Clarke/Attorney Alexander Ayoub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense attorneys note that drug sales to an undercover officer are usually straightforward prosecutions, especially when they come down to the word of a veteran detective versus that of a defendant with a history of dealing. Still, even after prosecutors reduced his charge to drug possession, Clarke says he never considered pleading guilty. He wanted to prove his innocence to his teenage daughter, who had begged him to stop selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pending case took its toll. Clarke says he applied for jobs in grocery stores and warehouses, but a wanted poster with his name and face from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/mountvernon/news/drug-sweep-leads-to-arrests-of-22-in-mount-vernon-with-six-on-the-run/736611/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 2018 press conference&lt;/a&gt; was now on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People just tell me, ‘Oh, we’ll get back at you,’ and never get back at me,” he said. He said his kids also came to distrust him, not knowing if he had really changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke waited more than five months after his arrest to face his accusers at trial. But in January, just before the proceedings were to start, the DA’s office dropped his case, according to Clarke’s former attorney Alexander Ayoub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayoub remembers that they did not want to disclose the identity of their undercover. The whole time, prosecutors never mentioned the framing allegations against Antonini, the attorney confirmed in an email. The DA’s office did not respond to questions about Clarke’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Gothamist/WNYC informed Clarke of the tapes months later, he was disgusted. “What that ADA just proved is no matter what, you’re guilty until proven innocent, and they will cover it and you basically gotta fight for your freedom,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That outcome, however, was better than many of the other defendants got in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patch.com/new-york/mountvernonny/mount-vernon-announces-successful-crackdown-drug-dealers&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highly-publicized&lt;/a&gt; roundup. Most pled to their charges or took plea deals, not willing to risk longer sentences by going to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There might be over a hundred other cases that this man done had his hand in that he tarnished, that he contaminated, you know?,” Clarke said. “People who are innocent, people getting railroaded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Newirth, a staff attorney with the Exoneration Project, a wrongful convictions organization, said even defendants who have pled guilty should have their cases reviewed. Some may have pled simply out of fear of longer separations from their families, she argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s being alleged here is essentially that on the Westchester County District Attorney’s watch criminal law enforcement agents were allowed to run rampant in the city,” she said. “They should inform all defendants who may be affected by this new information about these police officers and engage in a thorough review of these cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cities, such as Los Angeles and Dallas, police corruption investigations have resulted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/NREMassExonConf4418.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exonerations of defendants&lt;/a&gt; who had previously pled guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noto, the first deputy DA, said the office would launch such a review if its internal investigation substantiates any of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bovell, the whistleblower, is skeptical that prosecutors are willing to scrutinize their past work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have an active cop that gives them cases, they’re gonna find it hesitant to have to investigate the cop and turn over all these cases,” he said. “So they’d rather sweep it under the carpet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovell said he’s hoping the recordings will finally force a reckoning in Mount Vernon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is happening for real. It’s happening right here in the community,” he said. “And nothing is being done about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is part of an&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/black-cop-says-his-boss-called-him-rat-exposing-corruption-here-are-his-secret-recordings&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ongoing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/corruption-and-brutality-allegations-against-mount-vernon-detective-are-echoed-civilian-complaints&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;on police corruption allegations in Mount Vernon, New York and Westchester County&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have a tip about a prosecutor's office, a law enforcement agency or the courts, email reporter George Joseph at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gjosephwnyc@protonmail.com.

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/workflows/Build%20and%20(maybe)%20Release/badge.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/workflows/Build%20and%20(maybe)%20Release/badge.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Build&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates a virtual webcam device from the output of &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Especially useful for streaming smooth, composited video into Zoom, Hangouts, Jitsi etc. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam&quot;&gt;CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam&lt;/a&gt; but for macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218876/77819715-279b8700-709a-11ea-8885-aa15051665ee.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218876/77819715-279b8700-709a-11ea-8885-aa15051665ee.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mar-28-2020 01-55-07&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code was spun out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/15&quot;&gt;this OBS Project RFC&lt;/a&gt; which was itself spun out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2568&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tobi&quot;&gt;@tobi&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is for this (or something with equivalent functionality) to eventually be merged into the core OBS codebase 🤞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Donating 💸&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider sending some money in the direction of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/contribute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OBS Project&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/obsproject/contribute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Collective&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/OBSProject&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/obsproject&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, without OBS, this plugin would not be very useful! Hugh &quot;Jim&quot; Bailey is OBS Project's full-time lead developer and project maintainer. This money helps him continue to work on OBS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, after you donate to the OBS Project, you also want to send some cash my way that's appreciated too! Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/johnboiles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Buy Me a Coffee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://paypal.me/johnboiles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PayPal me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zoom, Slack, Webex, Skype and probably some other applications have disabled virtual cameras by default via &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;application restrictions&lt;/a&gt;. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility&quot;&gt;the wiki&lt;/a&gt; to see if your app is supported. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility/_edit&quot;&gt;edit the wiki&lt;/a&gt; if you try other software that we should include in that list. In most cases you can work around these restrictions by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility#apps-dont-allow-dal-plugins&quot;&gt;re-codesigning those applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo Booth and FaceTime do not support virtual cameras as of macOS 10.14 Mojave since they disallow loading any plugin that's not provided by Apple. Photo Booth can simply be duplicated and renamed (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Photo Booth copy&lt;/code&gt;) and it will work. There is no known workaroud for FaceTime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; need to restart your computer after installing new versions of this plugin (not sure why 🤷‍♂️).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the open &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/issues&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; for other reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download and install the latest version of OBS from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the latest &lt;code&gt;.pkg&lt;/code&gt; installer on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/releases&quot;&gt;Releases page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the &lt;code&gt;.pkg&lt;/code&gt; installer (entering your password when required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're already running OBS, make sure to restart it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart any app that was running during the installation process that is supposed to pick up the camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To start the virtual camera, go (in OBS) to &lt;code&gt;Tools&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;Start Virtual Camera&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your OBS video should now show up in the target app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uninstalling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily uninstall this plugin by deleting the OBS plugin (in &lt;code&gt;/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/&lt;/code&gt;) and the DAL plugin (in &lt;code&gt;/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Dozens of Android phone owners are reporting on social media that a picture featuring a lake, a cloudy sunset and a green shoreline is crashing their handsets when used as wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several brands seem to be affected, including Samsung and Google's Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug makes the screen turn on and off continuously. In some cases a factory reset is required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC does not recommend trying it out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung is due to roll out a maintenance update on 11 June. The BBC has contacted Google for comment but not yet had a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tweet on the issue has had thousands of likes and re-tweets, with some reporting that their phone has also been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech journalist Bogdan Petrovan at Android Authority &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidauthority.com/image-wallpaper-crash-soft-brick-1124505/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;said the bug did not affect his Huawei 20 Pro but it did cause a Google Pixel 2 to malfunction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed. It attempted to reboot, but the screen would constantly turn on and off, making it impossible to pass the security screen,&quot; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to affect some but not all devices running the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch event for Android 11 was due to take place this week but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52877792&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;has been postponed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has not yet been an official reason given for the bug but developer Dylan Roussel, who writes at 9to5Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1267165368709234689?s=20&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;tweeted his theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners also analysed it for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly,&quot; they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The phone crashes because it doesn't know how to deal with it correctly, and the software developers probably hadn't considered this might happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Software Engineering Within SpaceX</title>
<link>https://yasoob.me/posts/software_engineering_within_spacex_launch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://yasoob.me/posts/software_engineering_within_spacex_launch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9720188f4a96f07feae46f3ba852bebd913f8b36/cd9a3/images/spacex/dragon-launch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SpaceX Dragon launch&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! 👋 I am sure quite a few of you must have seen the SpaceX launch this past Saturday. It was an amazing and historic event. Millions of people were watching it live on YouTube and elsewhere. With each passing day, we are getting closer to commercial space flights and I have to agree I am excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fueling my excitement about space travel, this launch also made me curious about the tech which goes in these rockets. I did some research from the Computer Science perspective and wanted to share what I found. It goes without saying that most of this information is gathered from different sources I came across online. Even though I tried to make sure I don’t include any wrong information, there is no guarantee that this information is 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;teams&quot;&gt;Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/&quot;&gt;AMA by the SpaceX Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt; team 7 years ago where they shared some insights about how they work and what they work on. They have 4 separate Software teams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight Software team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flight Software team is about 35 people. We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations. We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Information Systems team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes SpaceX run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today’s work will be per those designs…and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ground Software team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW. We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment. We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avionics Test team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing. We catch problems with the hardware early; when it’s time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit. The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume. The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware-software-redundancy&quot;&gt;Hardware + Software Redundancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone also recounted their interaction with the SpaceX team at GDC &lt;sup&gt;2015&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2016&lt;/sub&gt; in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://space.stackexchange.com/a/9446&quot;&gt;answer on StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;. They talk about the tripple redundancy system and how SpaceX uses the Actor-Judge system. In short there are 3 dual core ARM processors running on custom board (&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23369065&quot;&gt;according to elteto&lt;/a&gt;). For each decision a “flight string” compares the result from each core on a single processor. If the output matches the command is sent to different controllers. There are 3 processors (with dual cores) so that means each controller/sensor will get three different commands. The controllers then act as the judge and compare the three commands. If all three are in agreement, they carry out the operation. If even a single command is in disagreement, the controller carries out the command from the processor which had previously been sending the correct commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that at any given point there are 6 running processes of the flight software.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-certifications&quot;&gt;Software Certifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the important software in mission-critical infra goes through various certifications. For instance, you can’t run any random software on an airplane. Even the entertainment system code has to satisfy various certifications. One such certification is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B&quot;&gt;DO-178B&lt;/a&gt; which stands for *&lt;em&gt;Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certification and correctness part is made easier by using software verification tools. One such tool is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.absint.com/astree/index.htm&quot;&gt;Astrée&lt;/a&gt;. It is a static code analyzer that checks for runtime errors and concurrency related bugs in C projects. This also leads us to the answer for why a lot of mission-critical code is written in C. Its because there are a lot of static analyzers and software verification tools for C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun fact which I got via &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23369675&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatic docking software for the ATV that delivers supply to ISS is written using C code and verified with Astree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX also made use of Chromium and JavaScript for Dragon 2 flight interface. I am not sure how that passed the certification. I assume it was allowed because for every mission-critical input on the display, there was a physical button underneath the display as well. So if in case the screen malfunctioned, the astronauts could potentially make use of the physical buttons. Regarding the use of Chromium and JS, a user on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23369065&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; had to say this as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, only the actual graphical display application uses Chromium/JS. The rest of the system is all C++. The display code has 100% test coverage, down to validation of graphical output (for example if you have a progress bar and you set it to X% the tests verify that it is actually drawn correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the buttons in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9a7ce36eefc5d6a91c2427b6458f38c6a4424b48/1dca5/images/spacex/touch-input.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Falcon 9 touch input display&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astronauts explain how the system works and what they do in case of UI malfunction in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/NASA/status/1266885097359388672&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission Critical infra also uses real-time operating system. These operating systems have special assurances that might not be provided by regular operating systems. For example, faster interrupt response and better memory protection. A RTOS provides real-time guarantees which are essential for such software. One such operating system is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/&quot;&gt;VxWorks&lt;/a&gt;. It was launched in 1987, targets Embedded systems, and is owned by Wind River Systems. It is used in the Mars Rover and SpaceX Dragon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks#Aerospace_and_defense&quot;&gt;among other systems&lt;/a&gt;). Having so many certifications doesn’t mean that bugs can’t show up. Apparently, the 2003 Mars rovers experienced a bug in their flash memory driver but it was sorted out by sending an update from earth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2574759/out-of-memory-problem-caused-mars-rover-s-glitch.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;model-rockets&quot;&gt;Model Rockets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to indulge your curiosities and explore programming for rockets, you should check out model rockets. Joe Barnard works on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bps.space/&quot;&gt;BPS.space&lt;/a&gt; and has made small hobby rockets do amazing stuff. He has developed his own little flight controller called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bps.space/signal&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;. He made a Falcon 9 replica which is stabilized using &lt;a href=&quot;https://bps.space/tvc&quot;&gt;Thrust Vector Control&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many opportunities nowadays for learning about actual space rockets and working your way up from small model rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d80cd077937cb961e55908bdb86be82872c46868/76541/images/spacex/falcon9-replica.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Falcon 9 replica&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in model rockets, you should explore the different certifications and licenses available in your country for amateur rocketeers. US has 3 levels of certifications and each level gives you more possibilities for rocket launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about how much cool stuff you can do using model rockets, check out this landing rocket developed by Joe below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to update this article based on any new stuff I find during my research. If you feel like I misquoted something or if there is something new I should add to this article please let me know in a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, have a wonderful day, and stay safe! 👋 ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: SpaceX also &lt;a href=&quot;https://iss-sim.spacex.com/&quot;&gt;launched a simulator&lt;/a&gt; where you can try your hands at docking the Falcon 9 with the ISS 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Declining worker power vs. rising monopoly power: explaining recent macro trends</title>
<link>https://voxeu.org/article/declining-worker-power-versus-rising-monopoly-power</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://voxeu.org/article/declining-worker-power-versus-rising-monopoly-power</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Declining worker power versus rising monopoly power: Explaining recent macro trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Stansbury, Lawrence H. Summers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot;&gt;02 June 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;863&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1980s, the US has seen a falling labour share and slow wage growth for typical workers. Measures of corporate valuations like Tobin’s Q have risen, and measured markups have increased. And – until the current crisis – unemployment had fallen to record lows, even as inflation stayed low, suggesting a decline in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Globalisation or technological change&lt;/strong&gt; have often been posited as causes for the falling labour share (e.g. Elsby et al. 2013, Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Abdih and Danninger 2017, Autor et al. 2020). But the decline in the labour share has been much more pronounced in the US than in other industrialised economies which are arguably similarly exposed to globalisation and technological change (Gutiérrez and Piton 2019). And the increases in corporate valuations and markups – as well as rising profit rates, even as the safe interest rate declines – appear to suggest that rents to capital have increased. This makes the recent evolution of the US economy difficult to explain in a perfectly competitive framework (particularly since one might have expected globalisation to have led to increased competition for US firms, and reduced profitability). These observations have rightly led many researchers to focus on country-specific, non-competitive explanations for these phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, therefore, a number of papers have argued that increasing &lt;strong&gt;monopoly or monopsony power&lt;/strong&gt; can explain trends in the labour share, corporate valuations, profitability, and markups (e.g. Barkai 2017, De Loecker et al. 2020, Eggertsson et al. 2019, Farhi and Gourio 2018, Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017, Philippon 2020). But while these factors have no doubt played some role, a different factor provides a more compelling explanation: the broad-based decline in worker power in the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recent paper, we argue that the &lt;strong&gt;decline in worker power&lt;/strong&gt; – as private sector unionisation and union power fell, the real value of the minimum wage declined, shareholder activism increased, and ‘ruthless’ management tactics became widespread – redistributed income from workers to capital owners, leading to a fall in the labour share, rising corporate valuations and measured markups, and a decline in the NAIRU (Stansbury and Summers 2020). We believe this explanation, which we dub the ‘declining worker power hypothesis’, has been substantially under-emphasised in recent macroeconomic debates. Our focus on the decline in worker power as the major structural change in the US economy is in line with a long history of progressive institutionalist work in economics, political science, and sociology (as exemplified by Freeman and Medoff 1984, Levy and Temin 2007, Bivens et al. 2018, Kristal 2010, Rosenfeld 2014 and Ahlquist 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this column, we present four arguments which demonstrate that the decline in worker power is a &lt;em&gt;more compelling&lt;/em&gt; explanation for recent macro trends than a broad-based rise in monopoly power:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It is not possible to identify separately a rise in monopoly power versus a fall in worker power from trends in Q, corporate profitability, and measured markups. The same trends could have been caused by either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The decline in worker power over the last four decades can explain trends in the labour share and corporate valuations at both the aggregate and the industry level (and can do so better than product market concentration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The decline in worker power is more consistent with another important macroeconomic trend of recent decades – the decline in the NAIRU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. There is a large body of direct evidence that there has been a broad-based decline in worker power in the US, while it is far from clear that there has been any broad-based rise in monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Rising monopoly power and falling worker power have the same implications for the labour share, Q, corporate profitability, and measured markups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of papers demonstrate that rising monopoly power could successfully explain the rise in corporate valuations and Tobin’s Q, the rise in measured markups, and the increase in corporate profitability even as safe interest rates have declined (Barkai 2017, Farhi and Gourio 2018, Eggertsson et al. 2019, De Loecker et al 2020). These facts, however, can be equally well explained by the declining worker power hypothesis. Assume that many firms have some degree of monopoly power – whether arising from explicit barriers to entry, or from features like heterogeneous production technologies or short-run fixed costs – and so generate ‘pure profits’ or rents. Worker power determines the degree to which workers receive a share of these rents. In this model, an increase in monopoly (or monopsony) power would increase the firm’s pure profits, increasing the share of income going to capital, increasing corporate profitability relative to the risk-free rate, and increasing Tobin’s Q. But, a decline in worker power would look similar: as worker power declines, rents are redistributed from labour to capital owners, meaning that the labour share declines, corporate profitability rises, and Tobin’s Q rises (as the expected value of future capital income increases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps less obviously, falling worker power and rising monopoly or monopsony power have the same implications for &lt;em&gt;measured markups&lt;/em&gt;. Falling worker power mechanically increases the markup measures commonly used in US data (like those in Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017 or De Loecker et al. 2020) – not because underlying market power for the firm has risen, but because these markup measures rely to some extent on a comparison of revenues to costs, where the measure of costs includes labour costs. If the rents earned by labour fall, reported labour costs fall, causing measured markups to rise mechanically even though there has been no change in underlying market power. We discuss this further in the endnotes.&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The decline in worker power can explain trends in the labour share, Q, and corporate profitability (and can do so better than rising product market concentration)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the decline in worker power big enough to explain these trends in practice? We attempt to quantify the decline in labour rents over 1982-2016, using estimates of the wage premia earned by unionised workers, workers at large firms, and workers in highly paid industries. On our metric, labour rents have declined substantially: from 12% of net value added in the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector in the early 1980s to 6% in the 2010s (Figure 1). This decline in labour rents is big enough to explain the entire decline in the labour share in the nonfinancial corporate sector (Figure 2).&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  And this in turn can explain much of the increase in corporate valuations: Greenwald et al. (2020) find that 43% of the increase in equity values over 1989-2017 can be explained by a reallocation of rewards from workers to shareholders as the labour share declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry-level evidence also supports the declining worker power hypothesis. Industries with bigger declines in labour rents saw bigger declines in their labour share and bigger increases in Q and corporate profitability. In horserace regressions, declining labour rents have substantially more explanatory power than rising product market concentration. And, much of the decline in the U.S. labour share occurred in manufacturing, which (given increasing globalization) is not an industry where a large rise in monopoly power seems likely to have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; The decline in labour rents, US nonfinancial corporate sector, 1982-2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/stansbury2junefig1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; Labour share and labour rent share, US nonfinancial corporate sector, 1982-2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. The decline in worker power is consistent with the decline in the NAIRU (more so than rising monopoly power)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most theoretical models would predict that a fall in worker power would lead to a fall in the NAIRU, as firms’ cost of hiring declines, or as ‘wait unemployment’ falls (e.g. Hall 1975, Mortensen and Pissarides 1999, Alvarez and Shimer 2011).&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Consistent with this, states and industries with larger falls in labour rents over 1984-2016 had larger falls in unemployment. Roughly extrapolating from our state-level estimates, we suggest that the fall in labour rents since the 1980s might have predicted a three quarters of a percentage point fall in the NAIRU. Similarly, Figura and Ratner (2015) estimate that the decline in the labour share could have contributed two-thirds of a percentage point to the decline in the NAIRU.&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a theory does not need to be able to explain all macro trends to be compelling, we do see the ability to explain the falling NAIRU as a strength of the declining worker power hypothesis: in contrast, there is no particular reason to expect rising monopoly power to cause a decline in the NAIRU (and indeed many models predict the opposite).&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. There is a large body of evidence of a broad-based decline in worker power (while it is far from clear that there has been a broad-based rise in monopoly power)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large body of work documents a broad-based decline in worker power in the US over recent decades (e.g. Levy and Temin 2007, Rosenfeld 2014, Ahlquist 2017, Farber et al. 2018). The private sector unionisation rate fell from over one third at its peak in the 1950s to 6% today, reducing wages both directly and indirectly (as unions tended to have positive spillovers on non-union pay). This decline was driven both by institutional factors – weakened labour law and its enforcement, the expansion of right-to-work – and economic factors like import competition and deregulation, which increased the elasticity of demand for labour.&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; In addition, rent-sharing power for non-union workers declined as shareholder power and activism increased, and more ‘ruthless’ corporate management tactics became widespread. These pressures resulted in wage reductions within firms,&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; reductions in the pay premia earned by workers at large firms or in highly profitable or high-wage industries,&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; and the ‘fissuring’ of the workplace (as companies increasingly outsource non-core business functions) (Weil 2014).&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declining worker power hypothesis builds on the work of a generation of labour economists. Industrial organisation economists are, however, typically less convinced by arguments that there has been a broad-based increase in monopoly power. For example, Carl Shapiro (2018), despite being an enthusiastic proponent of more aggressive antitrust, is critical of the “rising monopoly power explains macro trends view” taken by the Obama CEA and others. Among the points he makes are (1) rising industry-level national concentration does not necessarily reflect rising concentration in the markets firms compete in, (2) rising national concentration levels may reflect increased competition as successful firms spread their business, (3) industries may become concentrated as efficient firms compete and win market share, and (4) even where concentration ratios have increased they are most often below thresholds that usually raise profit concerns (see also Syverson 2019, Berry et al. 2019, and Basu 2019). In addition, we note that the substantial decline in the large firm wage premium is the opposite of what one would expect to see if large firms were gaining more monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broader implications of the declining worker power hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are convinced on the basis of these considerations that the declining worker power hypothesis is the right master narrative for understanding trends in the distribution of income, profitability, and the NAIRU. Of course, complex phenomena have multiple causes. And the declining worker power hypothesis is to some degree intertwined with other explanations for recent developments. If firms had no product market power, there would not be rents for workers to capture. Both technological developments and globalisation, by influencing the ‘outside options’ of firms, influence the extent to which workers can exercise power. Nonetheless, we believe the declining worker power hypothesis should play a major role in thinking about macroeconomic and labour market policy going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it suggests that fatalism about changes in the distribution of market income is unwarranted. Alongside progressive taxation and redistribution, policymakers concerned with equity and fairness might consider changes to the structure of capitalist institutions to rebuild countervailing power for workers (of the sort initially proposed by Galbraith 1952). Of course, the challenge would be to do this without introducing labour market rigidities sufficient to create a large increase in the NAIRU. The type of unemployment that risks being created by any policies should be considered, as well as the level. An increase in unemployment arising primarily from an increase in short-term ‘wait unemployment’, as workers spend longer searching for good jobs, is likely to be less of a problem than the development of a two-tier labour market where unprotected ‘outsiders’ spend long periods in unemployment (or are unable to access good jobs at all). In the design of new labour market institutions for the US economy, much can be learned from comparisons with the labour markets of other industrialised economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Endnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Baqaee and Farhi (2020) outline three measures for firm-level markups in the U.S. data: (1) Accounting profits approach, (2) User cost approach, (3) Production function estimation approach. All three of these methods for measuring markups include some measure of costs, including labour costs, in the denominator. This means that if rent-sharing with labour falls, measured labour costs will fall, leading to an increase in measured markups without any changes in the underlying product market power of a firm. This is illustrated in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting profits approach&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the simplest approach to markup measurement. If one assumes that operating income is equal to profits, this implies that markups are equal to sales divided by costs. Baqaee and Farhi (2020) use the expression &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/StansburyEquation1.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to back out firm-level markups µ, measuring operating surplus as operating income minus depreciation from Compustat data. Firm-level operating income is measured as revenue minus costs, where costs include labour costs. If rent-sharing with labour falls, measured labour costs will fall, leading to an increase in measured markups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User cost approach&lt;/strong&gt;: The user cost approach, used by Gutierrez and Philippon (2017) and Baqaee and Farhi (2020), is similar to the accounting profits approach – but, with a more sophisticated consideration of the cost of capital. In this approach markups are estimated as the ratio of sales to total average costs, which are calculated as operating expenses plus an imputed cost of capital. Markups can be estimated from the expression&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/StansburyEquation2.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where operatingsurplusi,t is the operating income of the firm after depreciation and minus income taxes, rkt,t is the user-cost of capital and Ki,t is the quantity of capital used by firm i in period t. Once again, since firm-level operating income is measured as revenue minus costs, where costs include labour costs, then if rent-sharing with labour falls, measured markups will mechanically increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production function estimation approach&lt;/strong&gt; : The production function estimation approach, used by De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020) (and based on De Loecker and Warzynski (2012)), estimates firm-level markup as a function of the estimated elasticity of output with respect to variable inputs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/StansburyEquation3.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the ratio of sales to variable costs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/StansburyEquation4.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure variable costs in the (imperfect) US firm level data, DLEU use Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Other authors have used instead COGS+SGA (Cost of Goods Sold, plus Sales, General, and Administrative) expenses. The elasticity of output with respect to variable inputs is estimated using the production function estimation technique as outlined in Appendix A of their paper. DLEU note that most of the rise in aggregate markups they identify is still present holding the elasticity term constant: that is, comes from an increase in the ratio of sales to variable costs. But note that – in a model of the world where firms earn some rents, and workers’ compensation includes these rents – some rents to labour will be included as part of the measure of variable costs. This means that a decline in rent-sharing with labour would show up under this measure as a decline in COGS relative to sales, and therefore would lead to a mechanical increase in the measured markup with no change in the underlying product market power of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Kristal (2010) and Jaumotte and Osorio Buitron (2015) argue that differential declines in worker power across countries can explain differential patterns of change in the labour share (and income inequality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Alongside its contribution to the fall in the labour share, declining worker power likely had substantial implications for labour income inequality. DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996), Farber, Herbst, Kuziemko, and Naidu (2018), and Fortin, Lemieux, and Lloyd (2019) present evidence that the decline in unionization can explain a large proportion of the rise in U.S. income inequality. In our paper, we find that the decline in labour rents was much greater as a share of compensation for non-college workers than for workers with a bachelors’ degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; “Wait unemployment” refers to the idea that, in a world where a given worker could get jobs with very different wages – some jobs with high rents, and others with low rents – unemployed workers have the incentive to spend longer searching for a high-rent job, increasing aggregate unemployment. A related concept is “rest unemployment”, where unemployed workers in high-rent sectors facing temporary downturns wait for their jobs to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; We have reason to believe that both the Figura and Ratner (2015) estimate and our estimate of the effect of the decline of worker power on the NAIRU may be underestimates of the true effect, since they are based on state/industry-level variation which may miss some aggregate effect, and since the imperfection of the labour share (in the case of Figura and Ratner) or the imputed labour rent share  (in our case) as proxies for the decline in worker power is likely to cause attenuation bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; See, for example, Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003), Geroski, Gregg and Van Reenen (1996), and Ebell and Haefke (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Note, however, that it is unlikely that the decline in unionization was only driven by economic factors. First, the proportional decline in the unionization rate from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s was almost identical across a range of sectors which had very different exposures to globalization, technological change, and deregulation over the period in question, and the rate of unionization has declined much more quickly in the U.S. than in most other industrialized economies, despite relatively similar exposure to trends in globalization and technology (Schmitt and Mitukiewicz 2012, Denice and Rosenfeld 2018). In addition, while Acemoglu, Aghion and Violante (2001) argue that the decline of unionization was driven by skill-biased technological change, Farber et al (2018) find that the pattern of decline of U.S. union membership is unlikely to be consistent with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; See, for example, Shleifer and Summers (1991), who argue that a primary effect of hostile takeovers is the redistribution of value to shareholders from other stakeholders. Some evidence consistent with this mechanism can be found in Davis, Haltiwanger, Handley, Lipsius, Lerner, and Miranda (2019), who find that wage premia in target firms were largely erased after private equity buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; We estimate the large firm and industry wage premia in our paper using the CPS. See also Hollister (2004), Even and Macpherson (2014), Cobb and Lin (2017), Song et al (2019) on the decline in the large firm wage premium, and Kim and Sakamoto (2008) on the decline in inter-industry wage differentials. See Bell, Bukowski, and Machin (2019) on the declining passthrough of profits to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; See also Bernhardt et al (2016) and Bidwell et al (2013) on the “fissuring” of the workplace, and Dube and Kaplan (2010), Dorn, Schmieder, and Spletzer (2018), Mishel (2018), Wilmers (2018), Handwerker (2018), and Song et al (2019) for evidence consistent with “fissuring” leading to lower wages.&lt;/p&gt;
