<title>Facebook’s Very Bad Month Just Got Worse</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/facebooks-very-bad-month-just-got-worse</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Who could have imagined that a creepy little app that scoured &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for pictures of women in bikinis might be the instrument that skewers the behemoth social network? Who, that is, besides Facebook executives and their lawyers? Until a little over a week ago, the company had successfully sequestered internal e-mails, which were obtained by the legal team of Ted Kramer, the founder of the app company Six4Three, during the discovery process in a 2015 lawsuit. At issue was Facebook’s policy of allowing third-party app developers to access the data of Facebook users’ friends—the very policy that enabled &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; to buy the data of eighty-seven million unwitting users on behalf of the Trump campaign. In Kramer’s case, his Pikinis app relied on that access; once Facebook changed its policy, in 2014, the app no longer worked. Kramer cried foul and sued Facebook for breach of contract. At the company’s request, the judge in the case ordered the records sealed to keep them, ironically, private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed on November 20th, when a parliamentary sergeant-at-arms showed up at Kramer’s London hotel room and escorted him to the halls of Westminster, where the Tory M.P. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, demanded that Kramer turn over all his files in the case under threat of arrest. Kramer, who was in London on unrelated business, said that he panicked and moved a number of files from a Dropbox account to a USB drive, which he turned over to the M.P. How Collins knew that Kramer was in London has been traced to the tireless &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has spent more than two years unravelling the connections between Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon&quot;&gt;Steve Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Mercer, and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit&quot;&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt;. After arranging to meet with Kramer, she appears to have &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/six4three-kramer-collins-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tipped&lt;/a&gt; off Collins to Kramer’s whereabouts. But how Collins knew that Kramer was in possession of the documents—which were not his to have—remains a mystery. There are reports that the two men had been in communication for the past few months, at Cadwalladr’s prompting, which suggests that the frog march to Parliament was just for show. (When Kramer’s lawyers found out that he was in possession of the discovery documents and that he had given them to Collins, they attempted to drop him, but, over the weekend, a California judge &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/12/01/facebook-leak-six4three/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; that they continue to represent Kramer until the matter of the purloined files is adjudicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins, for his part, claimed that whatever seal was in force in California was irrelevant in the U.K. On November 27th, he used the snatched e-mails to grill Richard Allan, the Facebook executive who was sent to speak for the company at an unprecedented international hearing on fake news and disinformation that Collins convened in Parliament. &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, who said he was too busy to appear—making this the fourth time that he has refused a request from Parliament—was represented by a nameplate positioned in front of an empty chair; every time the television cameras panned to Allan, they also showed his absent boss. Allan admitted that the optics were “not great,” and then went on to do his best Zuckerberg imitation, dodging and feinting as the lawmakers sought to put him on the spot. The most damning &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-considered-charging-for-access-to-user-data-1543454648&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; to emerge was that Facebook either gave, or considered giving, favored access to its users’ data to companies that spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in advertising on the platform. There also seemed to be &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3mkxe/facebook-was-aware-of-russian-meddling-as-far-back-as-2014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook had been informed, in 2014, that computers with Russian I.P. addresses were siphoning three billion data points a day from Facebook accounts, a claim that Allan refused to address in the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Collins published the full cache that he seized from Kramer. The &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two hundred and fifty pages&lt;/a&gt; of internal Facebook documents show, irrefutably, that the company did, indeed, whitelist a number of lucrative business partners, including Netflix, Lyft, and Airbnb, allowing them continued and unfettered access to the accounts of Facebook users and their friends after the company claimed that it had stopped the practice. The documents also reveal that, in 2015, a permissions update for Android devices, which users were required to accept, included a feature that continuously uploaded text messages and call logs to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout from Ted Kramer’s London misadventure was just one debacle of many during Facebook’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month. Back at Facebook headquarters, in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg was quite busy after all, doing damage control after a scathing New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; exposé. “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published on November 14th, created one of the biggest crises in the company’s history. As if to prove the reporters’ claims, Zuckerberg publicly denied their veracity. But the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; piece was deeply sourced and contained the disturbing revelation that the company had hired a right-wing opposition research group, Definers Public Affairs, to dig up dirt on &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros&quot;&gt;George Soros&lt;/a&gt;, after Soros gave a blistering &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/george-soros-calls-facebook-google-menace-society-obstacles-innovation-2018-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; at the World Economic Forum in Davos decrying the power of social media, especially Facebook and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, for their “far-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definers Public Affairs had previously &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; out misinformation about the Apple C.E.O., Tim Cook, on behalf of the tech company Qualcomm, which wanted to undermine Cook’s relationship with the Trump Administration. For Facebook, Definers launched a P.R. campaign—propagated through the conservative and alt-right media ecospheres—that traded on anti-Semitic innuendo to suggest that Soros was the deep pockets behind a grassroots anti-Facebook group. News of Facebook’s campaign against Soros came out three weeks after Cesar Sayoc, a fervent Trump supporter, sent a pipe bomb to Soros—and also to the Clintons, the billionaire Tom Steyer, and other prominent Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it got worse. On November 15th, shortly after the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; exposé was published, Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that “The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook’s behalf or to spread misinformation.” The next day, Facebook’s chief operating officer, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sheryl-sandberg&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt;, who is in charge of the company’s communications team, said, somewhat intricately, “I did not know about or hire Definers or any firm. . . . Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone.” But then, the night before Thanksgiving, in a Facebook blog post that the company perhaps thought would be lost in the holiday shuffle, Sandberg allowed that “I did receive a small number of e-mails where Definers was referenced.” A week later, after another damning &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, a company spokesperson admitted that it was Sandberg herself who had initiated an investigation into whether Soros had a financial interest in criticizing Facebook—that is, if the veteran financier had engaged in what is called “short and distort,” trash talking a company after betting that its stock will lose value. Not surprisingly, he hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros’s complaints about Facebook were hardly original: former Facebook employees like Chamath Palihapitiya, who served as its vice-president for growth, and investors like Roger McNamee have made similar criticisms. Nor was Soros being speculative. At the time of his Davos talk, the company’s role in enabling Russian operatives to exploit social divisions in the United States through Facebook ads and user pages, and helping the Trump campaign suppress the African-American vote, were well known. Indeed, in a two-part “Frontline” documentary, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Facebook Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;,” which was released at the end of October, a collection of former Facebook employees expressed concerns about the unwillingness of Zuckerberg and Sandberg to take meaningful responsibility for Facebook’s immense power and capacity to do harm. “My concerns, at the time, were that I knew that there were all these malicious actors who would do a wide range of bad things given the opportunity, given the ability to target people based on this information that Facebook had,” Sandy Parakilas, who had been the company’s platform operations manager in 2011, told the filmmakers. “So I started thinking through what are the worst-case scenarios of what people could do with this data . . . and I shared that with a number of people, both people in privacy and some senior executives. And the response was muted, I would say . . . I got the sense that this just wasn’t their priority. They weren’t that concerned about the vulnerabilities that the company was creating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those vulnerabilities were on full display on November 5th, the day before the midterm elections. In an effort to prevent the kinds of malign interferences that had dogged the Presidential election two years earlier, Facebook had set up what it was calling a “war room” to monitor its network. The company had already &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/31/technology/facebook-removes-pages/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; thirty Facebook pages, which it believed were designed by Russians to interfere with the elections. The war room was both a public declaration that Facebook was taking fake news and propaganda seriously and an admission that the platform remained susceptible to manipulation. “This is going to be a constant arms race,” Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global politics and government outreach director, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17991924/facebook-election-war-room-misinformation-fake-news-whatsapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Verge. “This is our new normal. Bad actors are going to get more sophisticated in what they’re doing, and we’re going to have to get more sophisticated in trying to catch them.” Since elections happen around the world throughout the year, the company planned to keep the war room open “for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit organization, issued a report that Facebook had commissioned to address concerns about the platform’s role in the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. While the Facebook platform has been used in other countries to cultivate ethnic and sectarian violence—Nigeria, Germany, Egypt, India, and Sri Lanka among them—its co-optation by the Myanmar army was especially heinous. Adopting the playbook of Russian operatives, the army created hundreds of seemingly innocuous Facebook accounts about celebrities, entertainment, and beauty, which it used to plant incendiary narratives about the country’s Muslim minority. In its response to the B.S.R. report, Alex Warofka, Facebook’s product policy manager, said that the company had already implemented a number of its recommendations but that “there is more to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Myanmar report was issued, Facebook was compelled to take down an inflammatory, racist &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-runs-racist-ad-on-facebook-targeting-arizona-and-florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video ad&lt;/a&gt;, paid for by the Trump campaign, on the grounds that the ad “violates Facebook’s advertising policy against sensational content.” The spot, which targeted voters in Florida and Arizona, blamed Democrats for an undocumented immigrant who had twice been deported before killing two sheriff’s deputies, in Sacramento, in 2014. Facebook’s policy disallows ads that are “dehumanizing or denigrating [to an] entire group of people, and using frightening and exaggerated rumors of danger.” The company removed the ad only after it had already been seen on Facebook by as many as five million people. And here’s the rub: while the ad “cannot receive paid distribution,” the company declared, “the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook.” So there you have it, the fecklessness of Facebook in a single sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November has passed, but Facebook’s troubles have not. A departing African-American Facebook employee charged, in a Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/27/facebook-has-problem-black-people-former-employee-says/2126056002/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, that the company was “failing its black employees and its black users”; Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/facebook-mark-s-luckie-african-american-workers-users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;took down&lt;/a&gt; his post. &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/nonprofits-facebook-get-hacked-need-help/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company was abandoning charities—which it had lured to the platform—once they’d been hacked. The election war room has been &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/facebook-wont-use-its-war-room-for-future-elections-report-says.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dismantled&lt;/a&gt;, leading some to suggest that it was a publicity stunt. Definers Public Affairs is no longer working for Facebook, but the damage to Sheryl Sandberg’s credibility and carefully coiffed public persona may prove irreversible—as Michelle Obama &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/03/michelle-obama-lean-in-sheryl-sandberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the other day, “it’s not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn’t work all the time.” And that creepy Pikinis app, courtesy of Damian Collins, has now supplied a portrait of naked greed and corporate dissembling. That empty seat in Parliament, where Mark Zuckerberg chose not to sit to answer the concerns of the global community, has suddenly got much hotter.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Australian parliament passes encryption laws unamended</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;published&quot;&gt;Updated &lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;December 06, 2018 22:45:57&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Security agencies will gain greater access to encrypted messages after a Labor backdown allowed the Federal Government to pass its legislation on Parliament's final sitting day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content wysiwyg right&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key points:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labor pulls its amendments to encrypted message access bill and votes to support the Government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Shorten claims he has a deal that the laws will be improved when Parliament returns in February&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government has pledged to only support amendments consistent with a parliamentary report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor had planned to amend the legislation, which it has repeatedly described as flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But late on Thursday Opposition Leader Bill Shorten announced Labor would pass the laws provided the Coalition agreed to make certain changes in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor then pulled its amendments in the Senate and the bill was passed before Prime Minister Scott Morrison had even responded to Mr Shorten's request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney-General Christian Porter later announced the Government had agreed to &quot;consider&quot; Labor's amendments &quot;if any genuinely reflect the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrangement ended a day-long stand-off between the Government and Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-06/scott-morrison-on-his-way-to-a-press-conference-at-parliament-h/10592092&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10591870-3x2-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scott Morrison walks through a doorway. He has one hand in his suit pocket while the other holds a rolled up folder. &quot; title=&quot;Scott Morrison in the halls of Parliament House&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-06/scott-morrison-on-his-way-to-a-press-conference-at-parliament-h/10592092&quot; class=&quot;inline-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;The bill was passed before Scott Morrison had even responded to Bill Shorten's request.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;(ABC News: Ian Cutmore)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-06/crossbench-mps-push-federal-government-refugees-on-nauru/10588374&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the crossbench had the numbers in the House of Representatives to force a vote that would have meant more refugees coming to Australia&lt;/a&gt; from Nauru and Manus Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, delays in the Senate dealing with that meant the Upper House was not able to change the encryption bill if it wanted it to become law this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do I go home and say 'well I hope nothing happens and I hope that the Government's politics don't backfire on the safety of Australians'? I'm not prepared to do it,&quot; Mr Shorten said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor's backdown came two hours after Mr Porter accused Labor of putting national security at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It became a pawn and a hostage to a larger game trying to embarrass the Government, and it's very, very unfortunate for the Australian people,&quot; Mr Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ultimately Bill Shorten and Labor put a tactical political ploy ahead of legislation that would have enhanced Australian safety.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concerns about the new laws linger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law Council of Australia slammed the major parties for creating a law that both sides of politics concede needs changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The half-amended encryption access laws rammed through the Senate are better than the original, but serious concerns remain,&quot; Law Council president Morry Bailes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We now have a situation where unprecedented powers to access encrypted communications are now law, even though the Parliament knows serious problems exist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Teague, an expert in cryptography at the University of Melbourne, said the debate over what constituted a &quot;systemic weakness&quot; had been central to criticisms of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laws mean police can request technology companies to build in features that would give access to encrypted communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But companies will not have to introduce such features if they are considered &quot;systemic weaknesses&quot; — that is, they are likely to result in weakened security for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier drafts of the bill failed to define the term at all, but even the definition introduced at the last minute is contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Teague said the new laws also failed to address the concerns of technical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole question all along has been, whether by targeting an individual user, they are accidently jeopardising everybody else's security,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The latest on Messages, Allo, Duo and Hangouts</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Communicating with the people in our lives is one of the most important things we do every day, whether it’s chatting with friends about an upcoming trip, calling mom to check in, or touching base with colleagues. Over the past few years, we’ve built products to help improve the way you communicate and today we’re sharing an update on our current efforts, and our focus moving toward a simpler communications experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing more in Messages, and bringing the best of Allo to Messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want every single Android device to have a great default messaging experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/topics/rcs/&quot;&gt;We’ve been working&lt;/a&gt; closely with the mobile industry to upgrade SMS so that people around the world can more easily enjoy group chats, share high-res photos, and get read receipts on any Android device. Thanks to partnerships with over 40 carriers and device makers, over 175 million of you are now using &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt;, our messaging app for Android phones, every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, we built &lt;a href=&quot;https://allo.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Allo&lt;/a&gt;, a smart messaging app, to help you get more done in your chats and express yourself more easily. Earlier this year we paused investment in Allo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/messages/&quot;&gt;brought some of its most-loved features&lt;/a&gt;—like Smart Reply, GIFs and desktop support—into Messages. Given Messages’ continued momentum, we’ve decided to stop supporting Allo to focus on Messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allo will continue to work through March 2019 and until then, you’ll be able to export all of your existing conversation history from the app—&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/allo/answer/7365005#download&quot;&gt;here are instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to do so. We've learned a lot from Allo, particularly what’s possible when you incorporate machine learning features, like the Google Assistant, into messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making video calls even easier with Duo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built Duo, our simple, high-quality video calling app, so you never miss a moment with the people who matter most. It’s one of Google's highest rated mobile apps and is seeing strong growth and engagement across both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we launched Duo support for iPad, Android Tablet, Chromebook, and Smart Displays, giving you more flexibility to make calls from your favorite devices. We also launched the ability to leave a video message, and will continue to bring more quality improvements based on machine learning that make video calls with Duo simple and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing our enterprise focus with Hangouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications at work, on both desktop and mobile, is critical to business success. In March of last year, we announced plans to evolve classic Hangouts to focus on two experiences that help bring teams together: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/products/chat/&quot;&gt;Hangouts Chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/&quot;&gt;Hangouts Meet&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve seen great adoption with both among our G Suite customers. Recently, we announced the ability to organize meetings with up to 100 participants in Meet and made it easier for businesses to use meeting solutions without worrying about compatibility with existing equipment. In the coming months, Chat customers will be able to include people from outside of their organization, making it easy to stay aligned with clients, vendors, partners and others, all from one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hangouts Chat and Meet are primarily focused on team collaboration for G Suite customers and at some point will be made available for existing Hangouts users, too. We’re fully committed to supporting Hangouts users in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada has arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer in Vancouver</title>
<link>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-has-arrested-huaweis-global-chief-financial-officer-in/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-has-arrested-huaweis-global-chief-financial-officer-in/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Canada has arrested the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies, who now faces extradition to the United States on suspicion she violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Meng Wanzhou, who is also the deputy chair of Huawei’s board and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on Saturday in Vancouver at the request of American law enforcement authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“She is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday,” Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod said in a statement to The Globe and Mail on Wednesday. “As there is a publication ban in effect, we cannot provide any further detail at this time. The ban was sought by Ms. Meng.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;j-f-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;c-ad--flex-gpt-1&quot; class=&quot;c-ad c-ad--inline c-ad--flex&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-ad__wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;A Canadian law-enforcement source with knowledge of the arrest said the United States is alleging Ms. Meng tried to evade the American embargo against Iran, but provided no further details. The source was granted anonymity by The Globe because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;U.S. prosecutors in New York have been investigating whether Huawei violated U.S. sanctions in relation to Iran, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Huawei said in a statement to The Globe that Ms. Meng faces “unspecified charges in the Eastern District of New York” and that she was arrested when she was transferring flights in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“The company has been provided with very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng. The company believes the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion,” Huawei said, and added the company “complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The Chinese embassy in Ottawa strongly protested the arrest of Ms. Meng, saying she had not violated Canadian or U.S. law and demanded her immediate release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the U.S. and Canadian side, urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal liberty of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,” the embassy said in a statement. “We will closely follow the development of the issue and take all measures to resolutely protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Chinese Ambassador Lu Shaye and four high-ranking members of the National People’s Congress also cancelled an appearance before the House of Commons foreign affairs committee scheduled for Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“I haven’t gotten an answer on why they cancelled, but the timing is certainly very curious,” Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O’Toole said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text c-article-body__text--interstitial&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-mengs-arrest-sparks-fury-in-china/&quot; class=&quot;c-article-body__link&quot;&gt;Arrest of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou sparks fury in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The decision by Canadian authorities to detain such a high-profile Chinese citizen – and particularly one sought for extradition to the United States – could hurt Canada-China relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Both China and the United States have been asking allies and trading partners to take sides in a trade war and the Trudeau government has spoken enthusiastically of pursuing some sort of trade deal with Beijing now that it has renegotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, predicted the arrest of Ms. Meng will provoke a backlash in China and hurt Huawei’s efforts to gain business in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“This is a really big deal. Ms. Meng is by birth and position a member of China’s corporate royalty,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“Her arrest, on suspicion of violating the Iran sanctions, should be seen as a clear signal that Canada is willing to face China’s fury to do the right thing. That said, it will be portrayed in China as Canada kowtowing to Donald Trump. The arrest also threatens to fatally undermine Huawei’s efforts to portray itself as a reliable infrastructure partner to its remaining supporters in the West.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;j-f-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-wrapper pb-feature pb-layout-item pb-f-commercial-dfp-ads&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The arrest comes as Canada is under intense pressure from the United States to bar the Chinese telecom from participating in next generation 5G mobile networks. The United States and Australia have barred Huawei 5G telecommunications and last week New Zealand blocked the first request from one of its wireless carriers to install the Chinese company’s equipment on its 5G network, citing a “significant network security risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the U.S. Senate intelligence committee, lauded Canada for the arrest of Ms. Meng and once again urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to bar Huawei from 5G technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;“Huawei has direct ties to the Chinese government and Communist Party, has long posed a serious risk to U.S. national security, and I continue to strongly urge Canada to reconsider Huawei’s inclusion in any aspect of its 5G development, introduction, and maintenance,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement to The Globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Mr. Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner wrote to Mr. Trudeau in October to caution that failure to ban Huawei could interfere with intelligence sharing and impair cross-border co-operation in telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Republican Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate armed services and banking committees, also praised Canada for the arrest and criticized Huawei as an agent of China’s ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;&quot;China is working creatively to undermine our national security interests, and the United States and our allies can’t sit on the sidelines,” Mr. Sasse said. “Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the Chief Financial Officer of a giant Chinese telecom company for breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-ad__message&quot;&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said Huawei and Chinese telecom ZTE represent a fundamental risk to Western national security and called for a comprehensive plan to hold “the Chinese and their state-sponsored entities accountable for gross violations of the law and threats to our security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Since at least 2016, U.S. authorities have been reviewing Huawei’s alleged shipping of U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The U.S. Justice Department probe, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, follows a series of actions aimed at stopping or reducing access by Huawei and Chinese smartphone maker ZTE Corp. to the U.S. economy amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;The probe is reportedly being run out of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, the Wall Street Journal sources said. However, the prosecutor’s office declined to confirm or deny the existence of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Ms. Meng, 46, who also goes by the name Sabrina, was appointed CFO of Huawei in 2011 and is also one of four deputy chairs. She appears to be being groomed for the top job at Shenzhen-based Huawei, which is now the world’s second-largest maker of telecommunications equipment. Her father was a former engineer in the People’s Liberation Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;Reuters reported in 2013 that Ms. Meng served on the board of Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. that later attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett Packard computer equipment to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator. Skycom reportedly has ties to Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;At least 13 pages of the Skycom proposal were marked “Huawei confidential” and carried Huawei’s logo. Huawei has said neither it nor Skycom provided the HP equipment; HP said it prohibits the sale of its products to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-article-body__text&quot;&gt;U.S. stock futures and Asian shares tumbled on Thursday due to the arrest of Ms. Meng, fanning fears of a fresh flare-up in tensions between the two superpowers. The news came as Washington and Beijing begin three months of negotiations aimed at de-escalating their bruising trade war, which is adding to global investors’ worries over rising U.S. interest rates and other risks to global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pipenv: promises a lot, delivers very little</title>
<link>https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipenv is a Python packaging tool that does one thing reasonably well — application dependency management. However, it is also plagued by issues, limitations and a break-neck development process. In the past, Pipenv’s promotional material was highly misleading as to its purpose and backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will explore the problems with Pipenv. Was it really recommended by Python.org? Can everyone — or at least, the vast majority of people — benefit from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-pipenv-does&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already learned that Pipenv is used to &lt;em&gt;manage application dependencies&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s learn what that term really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;application-dependencies&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id18&quot;&gt;Application dependencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#application-dependencies&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example use case for Pipenv: I’m working on a website based on Django. I create &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/git/website&lt;/tt&gt; and run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install Django&lt;/tt&gt; in that directory. Pipenv:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;automatically creates a virtualenv somewhere in my home directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writes a Pipfile, which lists Django as my dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installs Django using pip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proceeds to write &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Pipfile.lock&lt;/tt&gt;, which stores the exact version and source file hash &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id13&quot; id=&quot;id5&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; of each package installed (including &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pytz&lt;/tt&gt;, Django’s dependency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part of the process was the most time consuming. At one point, while locking the dependency versions, Pipenv hangs for 46 seconds. This is one of Pipenv’s notable issues: &lt;strong&gt;it’s slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, this isn’t the only one, but it defintely doesn’t help. Losing 46 seconds isn’t much, but when we get to the longer waits in the timing test section later, we’ll see something that could easily discourage users from using a package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;running-scripts-badly&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id19&quot;&gt;Running scripts (badly)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#running-scripts-badly&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s continue with our workflow. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv run &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;django-admin&lt;/span&gt; startproject foobanizer&lt;/tt&gt; is what I must use now, which is rather unwieldy to type, and requires running pipenv even for the smallest things. (The &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;manage.py&lt;/tt&gt; script has &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/env python&lt;/tt&gt; in its shebang.) I can run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv shell&lt;/tt&gt; to get a new shell which runs the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;activate&lt;/tt&gt; script by default, giving you the worst of both worlds when it comes to virtualenv activation: the unwieldiness of a new shell, and the activate script, which the proponents of the shell spawning dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv shell&lt;/tt&gt; means spawning a new subshell, executing the shell startup scripts (eg. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;), and requiring you to exit with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; or ^D. If you type &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;deactivate&lt;/tt&gt;, you are working with an extra shell, but now outside of the virtualenv. Or you can use the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--fancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; mode that manipulates &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/tt&gt; before launching the subshell, but it requires a specific shell configuration, in which &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/tt&gt; is not overridden in non-login shells — and also often changing the config of your terminal emulator to run a login shell, as many of the Linux terminals don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why does all this happen? Because a command cannot manipulate the environment of the shell it spawns. This means that Pipenv must pretend what it does is a reasonable thing instead of a workaround. This can be solved with manual activation using &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;source $(pipenv &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--venv)/bin/activate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (can be made into a neat alias), or shell wrappers (similar to what virtualenvwrapper does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;finishing-it-all-up&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id20&quot;&gt;Finishing it all up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#finishing-it-all-up&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I want a blog on my site. I want to write them in Markdown syntax, so I run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install Markdown&lt;/tt&gt;, and a few long seconds later, it’s added to both Pipfiles. Another thing I can do is &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--dev&lt;/span&gt; ipython&lt;/tt&gt; and get a handy shell for tinkering, but it will be marked as a development dependency — so, not installed in production. That last part is an important advantage of using Pipenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m done working on my website, I commit both Pipfiles to my git repository, and push it to the remote server. Then I can clone it to, say, &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/srv/website&lt;/tt&gt;. Now I can just &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install&lt;/tt&gt; to get all the production packages installed (but not the development ones — Django, pytz, Markdown will be installed, but IPython and all its million dependencies won’t). There’s just one caveat: by default, the virtualenv will still be created in the current user’s home directory. This is a problem in this case, since it needs to be accessible by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/&quot;&gt;nginx and uWSGI&lt;/a&gt;, which do not have access to my (or root’s) home directory, and don’t have a home directory of their own. This can be solved with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1&lt;/tt&gt;. But note that I will now need to export this environment variable every time I work with the app in &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/srv&lt;/tt&gt; via Pipenv. The tool supports loading &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/tt&gt; files, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; only when running &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv shell&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv run&lt;/tt&gt;. You can’t use it to configure Pipenv. And to run my app with nginx/uWSGI, I will need to know the exact virtualenv path anyway, since I can’t use &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv run&lt;/tt&gt; as part of uWSGI configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;what-pipenv-doesnt-do&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow I mentioned above looks pretty reasonable, right? There are some deficiencies, but other than that, it seems to work well. The main issue with Pipenv is: &lt;strong&gt;it works with one workflow, and one workflow only.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to do anything else, and you end up facing multiple obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;setup-py-source-distributions-and-wheels&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id22&quot;&gt;Setup.py, source distributions, and wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#setup-py-source-distributions-and-wheels&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipenv only concerns itself with managing dependencies. &lt;strong&gt;It isn’t a packaging tool.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want your thing up on PyPI, Pipenv won’t help you with anything. You still need to write a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;install_requires&lt;/tt&gt;, because the Pipfile format only specifies the dependencies and runtime requirements (Python version), there is no place in it for the package name, and Pipenv does not mandate/expect you to install your project. It can come in handy to manage the development environment (as a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt; replacement, or something used to write said file), but if your project has a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt;, you still need to manually manage &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;install_requires&lt;/tt&gt;. Pipenv can’t create wheels on its own either. And &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pip freeze&lt;/tt&gt; is going to be a lot faster than Pipenv ever will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;working-outside-of-the-project-root&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id23&quot;&gt;Working outside of the project root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#working-outside-of-the-project-root&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue with Pipenv is the use of the working directory to select the virtual environment. &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id14&quot; id=&quot;id6&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Let’s say I’m a library author. A user of my &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;foobar&lt;/tt&gt; library has just reported a bug and attached a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;repro.py&lt;/tt&gt; file that lets me reproduce the issue. I download that file to &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/Downloads&lt;/tt&gt; on my filesystem. With plain old virtualenv, I can easily confirm the reproduction in a spare shell with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ ~/virtualenvs/foobar/bin/python ~/Downloads/repro.py
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I can launch my fancy IDE to fix the bug. I don’t have to &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; into the project. But with Pipenv, I can’t really do that. If I put the virtualenv in &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.venv&lt;/tt&gt; with the command line option, I can type &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/git/foobar/.venv/bin/python&lt;/span&gt; ~/Downloads/repro.py&lt;/tt&gt;. If I use the centralized directory + hashes thing, Tab completion becomes mandatory, if I haven’t memorized the hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/git/foobar
$ pipenv run python ~/Downloads/repro.py
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I had two &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt; files, or &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;repro.py&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise depended on being in the current working directory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/git/foobar
$ pipenv shell
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foobar-Mwd1l2m9&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Downloads
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foobar-Mwd1l2m9&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;$ python repro.py
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foobar-Mwd1l2m9&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# (not deactivate!)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is becoming ugly fairly quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, with virtualenvwrapper, I can do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code shell&quot;&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Downloads
$ workon foobar
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foobar&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;$ python repro.py
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;foobar&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;$ deactivate
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget that Pipenv doesn’t help me to write a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt;, distribute code, or manage releases. It just manages dependencies. And it does it pretty badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;nikola&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toc-backref&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id24&quot;&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#nikola&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Permalink to this heading&quot;&gt;¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a co-maintainer of a static site generator, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://getnikola.com&quot;&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this, I have the following places where I need to run Nikola:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/git/nikola&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/git/nikola-site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/git/nikola-plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/git/nikola-themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/website&lt;/tt&gt; (this blog)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/Volumes/RAMDisk/n&lt;/tt&gt; (demo site, used for testing and created when needed, on a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive&quot;&gt;RAM disk&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That list is long. End users of Nikola probably don’t have a list that long, but they might just have more than one Nikola site. For me, and for the aforementioned users, Pipenv does not work. To use Pipenv, all those repositories would need to live in one directory. I would also need to have a &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; Pipenv environment for &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;nikola-users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, because that needs Django. Moreover, the Pipfile would have to be symlinked from &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/git/nikola&lt;/tt&gt; if we were to make use of those in the project. So, I would have a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;~/nikola&lt;/tt&gt; directory just to make Pipenv happy, do testing/bug reproduction on a SSD (and wear it out faster), and so on… Well, I could also use the virtualenv directly. But in that case, Pipenv loses its usefulness, and makes my workflow more complicated. I can’t use &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/tt&gt;, because I would need to hack a fuzzy matching system onto it, or memorize the random string appended to my virtualenv name. All because Pipenv relies on the current directory too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikola end users who want to use Pipenv will also have a specific directory structure forced on them. What if the site serves as docs for a project, and lives inside another project’s repo? Two virtualenvs, 100 megabytes wasted. Or worse, Nikola ends up in the other project’s Pipfile, which is technically good for our download stats, but not really good for the other project’s contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-part-where-i-try-to-measure-times&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pipenv is famous for being slow. But how slow is it really? I put it to the test. I used two test environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remote: a DigitalOcean VPS, the cheapest option (1 vCPU), Python 3.6/Fedora 28, in Frankfurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local: my 2015 13” MacBook Pro (base model), Python 3.7, on a rather slow Internet connection (10 Mbps on a good day, and the test was not performed on one of them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were runninng Pipenv 2018.7.1, installed from pip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the following cache setups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed: &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/.cache/pipenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial: &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;rm &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/.cache/pipenv/depcache-py*.json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/.cache/pipenv/hash-cache/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kept: no changes done from previous run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, turns out Pipenv likes doing strange things with caching and locking. A look at the Activity Monitor hinted that there is network activity going on when Pipenv displays its &lt;em&gt;Locking [packages] dependencies...&lt;/em&gt; line and hangs. Now, the docs don’t tell you that. The most atrocious example was a local Nikola install that was done in two runs: the first &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv install Nikola&lt;/tt&gt; run was interrupted &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id15&quot; id=&quot;id8&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; right after it was done installing packages, so the cache had all the necessary wheels in it. The install took 10 minutes and 7 seconds, 9:50 of which were taken by locking dependencies and installing the locked dependencies — so, roughly nine and a half minutes were spent staring at a static screen, with the tool doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in the background — and Pipenv doesn’t tell you what happens in this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Updated 2018-07-22: In the pipenv measurements: the first entry is the total time of pipenv executon. The second is the long wait for pipenv to do its “main” job: locking dependencies and installing them. The timing starts when pipenv starts locking dependencies and ends when the prompt appears. The third item is pipenv’s reported installation time. So, pipenv install ⊇ locking/installing ⊇ Pipfile.lock install.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-break-neck-pace-of-pipenv&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good packaging tool is stable. In other words, it doesn’t change often, and it strives to support existing environments. It wouldn’t be fun to re-download everything on your system, because someone decided that &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/usr&lt;/tt&gt; is now called &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/stuff&lt;/tt&gt;, and all the files in &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;/usr&lt;/tt&gt; would become forgotten and not removed. Well, this is what Pipenv did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;table table-striped table-bordered docutils&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;11%&quot;/&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;89%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;thead valign=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;head&quot;&gt;Date/Time (UTC)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;head&quot;&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-01-31 22:01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;v3.2.14 released. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; creates &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;./.venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (eg. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/git/foo/.venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). Last version with the original behavior of pipenv.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-01 05:36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;v3.3.0 released. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pipenv &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; creates &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/.local/share/virtualenvs/foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (to be precise, &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;$WORKON_HOME/foo&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-01 06:10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/178&quot;&gt;Issue #178&lt;/a&gt; is reported regarding the behavior change.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-01 06:18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kenneth Reitz responds: “no plans for making it configurable.” and closes the issue.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-02 03:05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kenneth Reitz responds: “added &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT&lt;/tt&gt; mode for classic operation. Not released yet.”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-02-02 04:29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;v3.3.3 released. The default is still uses a “remote” location, but &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.venv&lt;/tt&gt; can now be used.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2017-03-02 13:48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;v3.5.0 released. The new default path is &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;$WORKON_HOME/foo-HASH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, eg. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;~/.local/share/virtualenvs/foo-7pl2iuUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a month, the location of the virtualenv changed twice. If the user didn’t read the changelog and didn’t manually intervene (also of note, the option name was mentioned in the issue and in v3.3.4’s changelog), they would have a stale &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.venv&lt;/tt&gt; directory, since the new scheme was adopted for them. And then, after switching to v3.5.0, they would have a stale virtualenv hidden somewhere in their home directory, because pipenv decided to add hashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this is not configurable. One cannot disable the hashes in paths, even though &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/589&quot;&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1049&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; to. It would also help people who want to mix Pipenv and virtualenvwrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipenv is a very &lt;strong&gt;opinionated&lt;/strong&gt; tool, and if the dev team changes their mind, the old way is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipenv moves fast and doesn’t care if anything breaks. As an example, between 2018-03-13 13:21 and 2018-03-14 13:44 (a little over 24 hours), Pipenv had 10 releases, ranging from v11.6.2 to v11.7.3. The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/25df09c171a548fd71d4df735767bf763a653b83/HISTORY.txt&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; is rather unhelpful when it comes to informing users what happened in each of the releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pipenv, contrary to popular belief and (now removed) propaganda, is not an officially recommended tool of Python.org. It merely has a tutorial written about it on packaging.python.org (page run by the PyPA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipenv solves one use case reasonably well, but fails at many others, because it forces a particular workflow on its users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipenv does not handle any parts of packaging (cannot produce sdists and wheels). Users who want to upload to PyPI need to manage a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;setup.py&lt;/tt&gt; file manually, alongside and independently of Pipenv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipenv produces lockfiles, which are useful for reproducibility, at the cost of installation speed. The speed is a noticeable issue with the tool. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;pip freeze&lt;/tt&gt; is good enough for this, even if there are no dependency classes (production vs development) and no hashes (which have minor benefits) &lt;a class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; href=&quot;https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id13&quot; id=&quot;id11&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hatch attempts to replace many packaging tools, but some of its practices and ideas can be questionable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poetry supports the same niche Pipenv does, while also adding the ability to create packages and improving over many gripes of Pipenv. A notable issue is the use of a custom all-encompassing file format, which makes switching tools more difficult (vendor lock-in).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pip, setup.py, and virtualenv — the traditional, tried-and-true tools — are still available, undergoing constant development. Using them can lead to a simpler, better experience. Also of note, tools like virtualenvwrapper can manage virtualenvs better than the aforementioned new Python tools, because it is based on shell scripts (which can modify the enivironment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Internal Tensions at Facebook Are Boiling Over</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;81.070154577883&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a year teeming with scandals and missteps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/emails-show-sheryl-sandberg-aware-facebooks-definers-george&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/facebook-soros-scandal-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fiasco&lt;/a&gt; has inspired a clutter of leaks, finger pointing, and internal conversations about the future of the company and its leadership. And after more than a year of bad press, internal tensions are reaching a boiling point and are now spilling out into public view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumult is surprising given Facebook’s history as a tight-lipped organization where employees had little incentive to leak information or voice dissent outside the company’s walls. Throughout the crises, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who maintains majority shareholder control, has proven remarkably immune to outside pressure and criticism — from politicians, investors, and the press — leaving his employees as perhaps his most important stakeholders. Now, as its stock price declines and the company’s mission of connecting the world is challenged, the voices inside are growing louder and public comments, as well as private conversations shared with BuzzFeed News, suggest newfound uncertainty about Facebook’s future direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, the conflict seems to have divided Facebook into three camps: those loyal to Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg; those who see the current scandals as proof of a larger corporate meltdown; and a group who see the entire narrative — including the portrayal of the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/soros-facebook-definers-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hiring of communications consulting firm Definers Public Affairs&lt;/a&gt; — as examples of biased media attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s otherwise rational, sane people who’re in Mark’s orbit spouting full-blown anti-media rhetoric, saying that the press is ganging up on Facebook,” a former senior employee told BuzzFeed News. “It’s the bunker mentality. These people have been under siege for 600 days now. They’re getting tired, getting cranky — the only survival strategy is to quit or fully buy in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a Facebook spokesperson called this “a challenging time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are more determined than ever to continue making progress on the issues we’ve faced,” they said. “People at Facebook are focused on building products that help people connect and have a positive impact in the world.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former employees said the spate of negative reports has cast a shadow over the company in recent weeks. Current and former employees describe a tense and, at times, hostile atmosphere inside the company, one in which both senior employees and even staunch loyalists are contemplating their futures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are “hoping for a Sundar or Dara moment.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;78.111990008326&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are “hoping for a Sundar or Dara moment,” one former senior Facebook employee told BuzzFeed News, referring to past leadership changes at Google and Uber in which founding employees stepped aside from top jobs. A second senior employee echoed the view, suggesting that some inside the ranks are looking for a shakeup to come from the outside. The chatter has made its way outside of the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. “Senior people there know the only way out of this is by hiring a Dara,” a senior executive at a rival company told BuzzFeed News referring to Dara Khosrowshahi, the Uber CEO brought in to replace cofounder Travis Kalanick last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another former senior employee noted a growing sense of paranoia among current employees. “Now, people now have burner phones to talk shit about the company — not even to reporters, just to other employees,” they told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former workers have been empowered to bypass the press altogether and speak openly about their situations. Last month, Mark S. Luckie, a strategic partner manager for global influencers who quit in November, posted a 2,500-word memo that he had previously sent internally at the company to his personal Facebook to highlight what he saw as the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/former-employee-tells-facebook-in-a-memo-facebook-has-a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“black people problem.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In some buildings, there are more ‘Black Lives Matter’ posters than there are actual black people,” Luckie wrote, adding that “Black employees are commonly told ‘I didn’t know black people worked at Facebook.’” That post later mysteriously disappeared from Facebook after being flagged for violating the social network’s “community standards” before it was later restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These public protestations may be just the beginning for Facebook. Three former employees who spoke anonymously with BuzzFeed News for fear of retribution said that they did not sign paperwork that included language around nondisparagement, and in some cases forfeited their severance pay, upon departing the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employees at Facebook are required to sign nondisclosure agreements, preventing them from sharing trade secrets, when they first join and are encouraged to sign nondisparagement agreements upon their departure. By not signing that paperwork on the way out, those employees reserved the right to speak openly about their experiences at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“That’s the Sheryl I know”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chairman and CEO Zuckerberg maintains complete control over Facebook, it’s Sandberg who’s taken the brunt of the blame for the company’s recent scandals. As the person who oversees business operations and Facebook’s policy and communications efforts, the COO came under heavy fire for revelations surrounding her role in the disclosure of Russian disinformation efforts during the 2016 US presidential election, and for her subordinates’ hiring of a public relations consultancy that performed opposition research on billionaire investor George Soros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandberg has denied knowledge of the company’s hiring of the public relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, or its political work, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/emails-show-sheryl-sandberg-aware-facebooks-definers-george&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently admitted that she sent an email&lt;/a&gt; asking for research on Soros after he made public comments about Facebook at the World Economic Forum in January. Facebook maintained that request was independent of what Definers ended up working on regarding Soros later that spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The external pressure on Sandberg has divided employees across the company. In some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-26/facebook-s-sheryl-sandberg-is-tainted-by-crisis-after-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent stories,&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s second-in-command has been portrayed as preoccupied with her own legacy, and as an executive who surrounded herself with loyalists and sometimes prioritized her own brand above the company’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some Facebook employees have taken issue with that narrative. Shortly after the publication of a November &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times story&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook in crisis, many employees posted to the company’s internal communications groups, including one called “Women @ Facebook,” voicing their support for Facebook’s COO and sharing personal experiences of working with or for Sandberg, according to two people who had seen the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Facebook employees have also shared their views publicly. Matt Jacobson, Facebook’s head of market development and one of its longest-serving employees, called the “roughest of news cycles” a “ very personal attack on Sheryl Sandberg as a leader and a human being” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jake/posts/10108813774387296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in an internal note&lt;/a&gt; he later published to his personal Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One does not simply fire the author of &lt;em&gt;Lean In&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;102.15711754282&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Schadenfreude runs deep, especially when it comes to someone who has succeeded and brought so many along with her,” he wrote last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That echoed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant/posts/2118380851545995&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a Facebook post by Adam Grant,&lt;/a&gt; the co-author of Sandberg’s second book, &lt;em&gt;Option B&lt;/em&gt;, and a board member at her foundation Lean In. The post, which objected to the so-called vilification of Sandberg’s character, found sympathetic ears among many Facebook employees, including Justin Osofsky, vice president of global operations and corporate development, and vice president of global marketing solutions Carolyn Everson, who thanked Grant for “sharing the real Sheryl Sandberg with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheryl's investment in so many others and particularly in causes for women is something I’m witness to daily,” Janelle Gale, Facebook’s vice president of human resources, commented on the post. “That’s the Sheryl I know too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“An intense culture of conformity”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Blind, a semi-public app that allows current and former employees with a company email to post anonymously, Facebook employees on Facebook-related message boards are openly speculating about and arguing over Sandberg’s fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board is being questioned for not taking action, but Zuck will side with her like he is spellbound,” one user wrote, asking if the company could find a solution to its leadership struggles. “Shall we have a walkout to let her go like what Google employees did?” another countered, referencing the worker action taken at the search giant in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/matthewchampion/google-walkout-sexual-misconduct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thousands of employees marched&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s policies around sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others argued that bad optics would prevent the company from removing Sandberg, a noted feminist author. “One does not simply fire the author of ‘Lean In’ and pretty much the sole female executive in top leadership,” one Blind user wrote. Another remarked that Sandberg’s personal image was politically polarizing. “Her left-leaning brand has hurt us considerably, we need to mend fences and be seen to be a platform for the left and the right going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions across Facebook’s Blind page quickly turn tense at the mention of Sandberg. A user with the username “SherylS” expressed frustration at those in the company revering Sandberg as a women’s icon and leader. “It’s time to stand up to these fake opportunist feminist champions though,” they wrote. “‘Give me opportunities to succeed!! I’m a victim!! Lean in!!” the post read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the disagreement centers on social justice–minded individuals inside the company, pointing to an internal Facebook Workplace group called “Let’s Fix Facebook”: “Just go read ‘let’s fix Facebook’ for a bit and see all the sjw complainers.” Indeed, some inside Blind’s current and former Facebook employee group debated whether Sandberg was insulated from legitimate criticism due to her defenders “playing the woman card.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again [it's] the female card that has caused so much damage in such a short time, not just at Facebook,” another poster wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some called Sandberg “a shrewd businesswoman” who would not be intimidated into leaving, while others suggested that Sandberg is bearing the brunt of the criticism that should be directed toward Zuckerberg. “Can’t get anything to stick on Mark? Call the lady COO incompetent,” another user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can’t get anything to stick on Mark? Call the lady COO incompetent.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;82&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Blind posts viewed by BuzzFeed News concerning Facebook’s leadership, Zuckerberg is infrequently mentioned and often only brought up in reference to Sandberg’s future. “Zuck is too sentimental towards her and it’s hurt his judgement of the situation,” one post read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common narrative across Blind and shared by some current and former senior employee is the notion that Facebook’s troubles have been exaggerated and perpetuated by unjust media coverage. They see the blame cast on the company by the public and the press as reactionary and, in the case of a recent bombshell report by the New York Times, even inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The media will keep attacking and exposing us with more leaks from the inside...this will all go on until she is gone and there is a shakeup,” one person posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t know what has Sheryl done to deserve being fired? The last I checked most allegations seemed like baseless media propaganda. What am I missing?” one wrote, while another suggested that the “media keeps talking about anti semitic conspiracy theories but the articles lack any clear explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While only one window into the views of current and former employees, the Blind threads viewed by BuzzFeed News depict a company currently grappling with its culture and issues of loyalty, particularly surrounding Sandberg. Some posts appear even to encourage unwavering, resolute support for leadership during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love Sheryl. Because Mark loves Sheryl. This is Mark’s company, not yours. He knows Sheryl better than you do and knows what this company needs better than you do. He gives you so much you get confused in your entitled ass that this is your company,” one user wrote. “I trust Mark. And if Mark drives the company into the ground it’s his company to drive into the ground. Go work somewhere else or go start your own company if you know so much better than him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all agree. “Funny, Hitler’s followers said something similar. We all know how that went,” one user replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, others seem to be questioning the “sycophantic” nature of the conversations across Facebook’s internal Workplace system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have an intense culture of conformity,” one user said. “It could be that this pressure to drink the Kool-Aid and to only talk about positive things is a reason behind the large number of leaks we suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“2020 will be another shit show.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s really seeped in the last few years,” another added. “Election season is always the worst too, 2020 will be another shit show.” A third user added, “In this company, if you tell the truth, you are dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, as Facebook's employees debate her future publicly and privately, Sandberg has set her sights on damage control. Still reeling from the revelation that Facebook’s communications and policy team hired a public affairs team to investigate George Soros, Sandberg has been trying to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to two sources, she attempted to call Soros last month, within days of the reports about Definers, and left a message after he didn’t pick up. Soros has yet to call her back because he’s been traveling, a source told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It appears he’ll be traveling for a while,” the source said. ●&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With reporting from Caroline O’Donovan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>At 22 years old, Postgres might just be the most advanced database yet</title>
<link>https://arcentry.com/blog/postgres-might-just-be-the-most-advanced-database-ever/#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arcentry.com/blog/postgres-might-just-be-the-most-advanced-database-ever/#</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/717729364822134785/APDm2K-o_400x400.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcentry.com/blog/postgres-might-just-be-the-most-advanced-database-ever/postgres.svg&quot; alt=&quot;PostgreSQL Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a techy, many of the debates I engage in can be boiled down to just one question: Should we pick the new thing or the proven one? As passionate as this question is discussed, there are a handful of technologies where the answer is easy: Why not both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres is such a technology. Originally released in 1996 (and effectively developed since 1982), it is now 22 years old - yet in many respects, it is the most modern database management system there is. Not only does it come with a simply mindboggling set of features, but it also transcends being a pure database and evolved into a fully programmable, integrated data environment, complete with its own programming language PL/pgSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's any number of marvels one can discuss in regards to Postgres - but for this article, I'd like to shed light on the five extraordinary features that made it our backend of choice for Arcentry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pub-sub-messaging&quot;&gt;Pub/Sub Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres can be used as a clusterable message broker. Granted, it doesn't come with the featureset that purpose-built solutions like RabbitMQ or Kafka offer, but its integration of event-based messaging into the wider data-context makes it extremely valuable. Arcentry's on-premise version, for instance, makes use of this pattern. We use Postgres-Messaging as the backbone for horizontally scalable deployments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a user makes a change to any diagram, Arcentry issues a request to a server which merges the update into a binary JSON document stored in Postgres. Once the write is confirmed, a trigger emits an event that all other connected servers are subscribed to which in turn forwards the update to its active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us an easy way to provide horizontally scalable realtime updates with strong consistency - all from a single external dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;triggers&quot;&gt;Triggers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triggers are functions that run before or after data is manipulated. They are a fantastic way to build validation, transformation and derived logic directly into the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triggers also present a simple way to extend existing database functionality. For example, take customers asking for an immutable audit log of changes to Arcentry's account table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than writing an additional query or service endpoint, we simply programmed a trigger into Postgres that runs whenever a row in the accounts table is altered and writes a copy of the current row, complete with timestamp and the userId that initiated the change to a separate audit table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;foreign-data-wrappers&quot;&gt;Foreign Data Wrappers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is nice to integrate a user's existing Database into Arcentry - whether to query user accounts or to store document data within an established structure. There is - of course - any number of ways to achieve this, but a particularly convenient one are Postgres' &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers&quot;&gt;Foreign Data Wrappers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are endpoints that connect Postgres to any number of other data sources, say MongoDB, Redis, MySQL or even CSV or JSON files. As far as the query statement is concerned, these sources are just regular Postgres tables that can be joined, searched, referenced and become an organic part of the database - making Postgres a powerful integration tool and potential access point for data-lake setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;jsonb&quot;&gt;JSONB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many databases store JSON or its binary representation, JSONB - and I get that this won't spark too much excitement anymore. But Postgres' manipulation functions make JSON a first class citizen within a table based, relational database. Whether its outputting query results as a nested JSON structure or parsing JSON on the fly, Postgres can handle it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-ons&quot;&gt;Add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, however, neither PL/pgSQL nor Triggers are enough to achieve the functionality one needs. With many other databases this would simply be the end of it - but Postgres is impressively extendable. Writing Postgres Addons is not an easy task (trust me, I tried), but fortunately, many talented engineers have done the work for me and built extensions that turn Postgres into an entirely different product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for instance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgis.org/&quot;&gt;PostGIS&lt;/a&gt; that turns the Postgres server into a fully fledged spatial database for geographic information systems (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pipelinedb.com/&quot;&gt;PipelineDB&lt;/a&gt; that turns Postgres into a timeseries store/ stream processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's any number of Postgres extensions, tools and GUIs, an overview over which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-granddad-hipster&quot;&gt;A granddad-hipster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes all this truly stand out is the example that Postgres sets: Remaining relevant for 22 years is an almost impossible feat for any software - but keeping a strong focus and investing decades into improving, refining and optimizing an already strong core can create a piece of technology that today is as relevant as it was back in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;Dark fluid&amp;#039; with negative mass could dominate the universe</title>
<link>https://theconversation.com/bizarre-dark-fluid-with-negative-mass-could-dominate-the-universe-what-my-research-suggests-107922</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/bizarre-dark-fluid-with-negative-mass-could-dominate-the-universe-what-my-research-suggests-107922</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s embarrassing, but astrophysicists are the first to admit it. Our best &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/CosmologyEssays/The_Standard_Cosmology.html&quot;&gt;theoretical model&lt;/a&gt; can only explain 5% of the universe. The remaining 95% is famously made up almost entirely of invisible, unknown material dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-experiments-trying-to-crack-physics-biggest-question-what-is-dark-energy-52917&quot;&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/from-machos-to-wimps-meet-the-top-five-candidates-for-dark-matter-51516&quot;&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;. So even though there are a billion trillion stars in the observable universe, they are actually extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two mysterious dark substances can only be inferred from gravitational effects. Dark matter may be an invisible material, but it exerts a gravitational force on surrounding matter that we can measure. Dark energy is a repulsive force that makes the universe expand at an accelerating rate. The two have always been treated as separate phenomena. But my new study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07962&quot;&gt;published in Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, suggests they may both be part of the same strange concept – a single, unified “dark fluid” of negative masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative masses are a hypothetical form of matter that would have a type of negative gravity – repelling all other material around them. Unlike familiar positive mass matter, if a negative mass was pushed, it would accelerate towards you rather than away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative masses are not a new idea in cosmology. Just like normal matter, negative mass particles would become more spread out as the universe expands – meaning that their repulsive force would become weaker over time. However, studies have shown that the force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe is relentlessly constant. This inconsistency has previously led researchers to abandon this idea. If a dark fluid exists, it should not thin out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, I propose a modification to Einstein’s theory of general relativity to allow negative masses to not only exist, but to be created continuously. “Matter creation” was already included in an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-crashed-its-host-website-heres-what-it-says-in-simple-terms-86351&quot;&gt;alternative theory to the Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Steady State model. The main assumption was that (positive mass) matter was continuously created to replenish material as the universe expands. We now know from observational evidence that this is incorrect. However, that doesn’t mean that negative mass matter can’t be continuously created. I show that this assumed dark fluid is never spread too thinly. Instead it behaves exactly like dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;440&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/56AIR9ZDv3w?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also developed a 3D computer model of this hypothetical universe to see if it could also explain the physical nature of dark matter. Dark matter was introduced to explain the fact that galaxies are spinning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve&quot;&gt;much faster than our models predict&lt;/a&gt;. This implies that some additional invisible matter must be present to prevent them from spinning themselves apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My model shows that the surrounding repulsive force from dark fluid can also hold a galaxy together. The gravity from the positive mass galaxy attracts negative masses from all directions, and as the negative mass fluid comes nearer to the galaxy it in turn exerts a stronger repulsive force onto the galaxy that allows it to spin at higher speeds without flying apart. It therefore appears that a simple minus sign may solve one of the longest standing problems in physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the universe really this weird?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may argue that this sounds a little far fetched. But while negative masses are bizarre, they are considerably less strange than you may immediately think. For starters, these effects may only seem peculiar and unfamiliar to us, as we reside in a region dominated by positive mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether physically real or not, negative masses already have a theoretical role in a vast number of areas. Air bubbles in water can be modelled as having a negative mass. Recent laboratory research has also generated particles that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/vamivakas-microcavity-negative-mass-generate-lasers-290202/&quot;&gt;behave exactly as they would if they had negative mass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And physicists are already comfortable with the concept of negative energy density. According to quantum mechanics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/what-is-nothing-martin-rees-qanda-101498&quot;&gt;empty space is made up of a field of fluctuating background energy&lt;/a&gt; that can be negative in places – giving rise to waves and virtual particles that pop into and out of existence. This can even create a tiny force that can be measured in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study could help solve many problems in modern physics. String theory, which is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/stephen-hawking-had-pinned-his-hopes-on-m-theory-to-fully-explain-the-universe-heres-what-it-is-93440&quot;&gt;best hope for unifying&lt;/a&gt; the physics of the quantum world with Einstein’s theory of the cosmos, is currently seen as being incompatible with observational evidence. However, string theory does suggest that the energy in empty space must be negative, which corroborates the theoretical expectations for a negative mass dark fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the team behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300499/fulltext/&quot;&gt;groundbreaking discovery of an accelerating universe&lt;/a&gt; surprisingly detected evidence for a negative mass cosmology, but took the reasonable precaution of interpreting these controversial findings as “unphysical”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory could also solve the problem of measuring the universe’s expansion. This is explained by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/game-changing-resolution-whose-name-on-the-laws-of-physics-for-an-expanding-universe-102099&quot;&gt;Hubble-Lemaître Law&lt;/a&gt;, the observation that more distant galaxies are moving away at a faster rate. The relationship between the speed and the distance of a galaxy is set by the “Hubble constant”, but measurements of it have continued to vary. This has led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-universes-rate-of-expansion-is-in-dispute-and-we-may-need-new-physics-to-solve-it-100154&quot;&gt;crisis in cosmology&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, a negative mass cosmology mathematically predicts that the Hubble “constant” should vary over time. Clearly, there is evidence that this weird and unconventional new theory deserves our scientific attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to go from here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creator of the field of cosmology, Albert Einstein, did – along with other scientists including Stephen Hawking – consider negative masses. In fact, in 1918 Einstein even wrote that his theory of general relativity &lt;a href=&quot;https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol7-trans/47&quot;&gt;may have to be modified to include them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these efforts, a negative mass cosmology could be wrong. The theory seems to provide answers to so many currently open questions that scientists will – quite rightly – be rather suspicious. However, it is often the out-of-the-box ideas that provide answers to longstanding problems. The strong accumulating evidence has now grown to the point that we must consider this unusual possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest telescope to ever be built – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skatelescope.org/&quot;&gt;the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)&lt;/a&gt; – will measure the distribution of galaxies throughout the history of the universe. I’m planning to use the SKA to compare its observations to theoretical predictions for both a negative mass cosmology and the standard one – helping to ultimately prove whether negative masses exist in our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that this new theory generates a wealth of new questions. So as with all scientific discoveries, the adventure does not end here. In fact, the quest to understand the true nature of this beautiful, unified, and – perhaps polarised – universe has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Emails written by Facebook's chief and his deputies show the firm struck secret deals to give some developers special access to user data while refusing others, according to MPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cache of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;internal documents has been published online&lt;/a&gt; by a parliamentary committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the files also showed Facebook had deliberately made it &quot;as hard as possible&quot; for users to be aware of privacy changes to its Android app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook had objected to their release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that the documents had been presented in a &quot;very misleading manner&quot; and required additional context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emails were obtained from the chief of Six4Three - a software firm that is suing the tech giant - and were disclosed by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of its inquiry into fake news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 250 pages have been published, some of which are marked &quot;highly confidential&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Collins MP, the chair of the committee, highlighted several &quot;key issues&quot; in an introductory note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Facebook allowed some companies to maintain &quot;full access&quot; to users' friends data even after announcing changes to its platform in 2014/2015 to limit what developers' could see. &quot;It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted,&quot; Mr Collins wrote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Facebook had been aware that an update to its Android app that let it collect records of users' calls and texts would be controversial. &quot;To mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features,&quot; Mr Collins wrote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Facebook used data provided by the Israeli analytics firm Onavo to determine which other mobile apps were being downloaded and used by the public. It then used this knowledge to decide which apps to acquire or otherwise treat as a threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;there was evidence that Facebook's refusal to share data with some apps caused them to fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;there had been much discussion of the financial value of providing access to friends' data&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook said Six4Three had &quot;cherry-picked&quot; the documents and claimed they had omitted &quot;important context&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends' data with developers,&quot; said a spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the facts are clear: we've never sold people's data.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Zuckerberg has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10105559172610321&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;posted a personal response on his Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That's healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it's also important that the coverage of what we do - including the explanation of these internal documents - doesn't misrepresent our actions or motives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Tactics revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correspondence includes emails between Facebook and several other tech firms, in which the social network appears to agree to add third-party apps to a &quot;whitelist&quot; of those given permission to access data about users' friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be used, for example, to allow an app's users to continue seeing which of their Facebook friends were using the same service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Netflix tapped into Facebook friends lists to let users see what titles their contacts had watched and rated highly
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;the dating service Badoo, its spin-off Hot or Not, and Bumble - another dating app that it had invested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;the car pick-up service Lyft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;the video-streaming service Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;the home rental service Airbnb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, others including the ticket sales service Ticketmaster, Twitter's short-video platform Vine and the connected-cars specialist Airbiquity seem to have been denied the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the emails that have been published are the following extracts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Blocking Vine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following concerns a decision to prevent Twitter's short-form video service having access to users' friends lists. It is dated 24 January 2012.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Osofsky&lt;/strong&gt; (Facebook vice president):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video... Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We've prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; (Facebook chief executive):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yup, go for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Android update&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following is part of a discussion about giving Facebook's Android app permission to read users' call logs. It is dated 4 February 2015.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael LeBeau&lt;/strong&gt; (Facebook product manager):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you know all the growth team is planning on shipping a permissions update on Android at the end of this month. They are going to include the 'read call log' permission... This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it...[The danger is] screenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme (as it has in the past), propagates around the web, it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about &quot;Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Data leaks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following is from a discussion in which Mark Zuckerberg mulled the idea of selling developers access to users' friends' data. It is dated October 2012, pre-dating the quiz involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was sent to Sam Mullin, who was vice president of product management.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; (Facebook chief executive):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale. I'm getting more on board with locking down some parts of platform, including friends' data and potentially email addresses for mobile apps. I'm generally sceptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think... I think we leak info to developers but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Membership fees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following is from an email sent by Mark Zuckerberg to several of his executives in which he explains why he does not think making users pay for Facebook would be a good idea. It is dated 19 November 2012.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; (Facebook chief executive):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The question is whether we could charge and still achieve ubiquity. Theoretically, if we could do that, it would be better to get ubiquity and get paid. My sense is there may be some price we could charge that wouldn't interfere with ubiquity, but this price wouldn't be enough to make us real money. Conversely, we could probably make real money of we were willing to sacrifice ubiquity, but that doesn't seem like the right trade here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
