&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile network operators who sold their customers' real-time location data violated US law and the Federal Communications Commission will try to punish carriers that did so, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wrote today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[T]he FCC's Enforcement Bureau has completed its extensive investigation and... it has concluded that one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law,&quot; Pai wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pais-response-representatives-regarding-location-data&quot;&gt;letter today&lt;/a&gt; to Democratic members of Congress who asked for an update on the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am committed to ensuring that all entities subject to our jurisdiction comply with the Communications Act and the FCC's rules, including those that protect consumers' sensitive information, such as real-time location data,&quot; Pai's letter continued. &quot;Accordingly, in the coming days, I intend to circulate to my fellow Commissioners for their consideration one or more Notice(s) of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture in connection with the apparent violation(s).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carriers could fight such notices in an attempt to avoid punishment. AT&amp;amp;T has &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/att-t-mobile-verizon-say-they-finally-stopped-selling-phone-location-data/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that selling location data wasn't illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has repeatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pajken/fcc-commissioners-agency-phone-location-data-investigation&quot;&gt;urged Pai&lt;/a&gt; to reveal details of the investigation. In a statement released today, Rosenworcel said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the FCC was silent after news reports alerted us that for just a few hundred dollars, shady middlemen could sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data. It's chilling to consider what a black market could do with this data. It puts the safety and privacy of every American with a wireless phone at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this agency finally announced that this was a violation of the law. Millions and millions of Americans use a wireless device every day and didn't sign up for or consent to this surveillance. It's a shame that it took so long for the FCC to reach a conclusion that was so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) said that Pai's response to lawmakers &quot;is a step in the right direction, but I'll be watching to make sure the FCC doesn't just let these lawbreakers off the hook with a slap on the wrist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that he is &quot;eager to see whether the FCC will truly hold wireless companies accountable or let them off with a slap on the wrist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carriers sold data after promise to stop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over location-data sales ramped up in 2018 when a security problem &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/05/service-leaked-locations-of-us-cell-phones-for-free-no-password-required/&quot;&gt;leaked the real-time locations&lt;/a&gt; of US cell phone customers on all four major carriers. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint subsequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/verizon-and-att-will-stop-selling-your-phones-location-to-data-brokers/&quot;&gt;pledged to stop&lt;/a&gt; selling their mobile customers' location information to third-party data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile&quot;&gt;investigation by Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; in January 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/t-mobile-sprint-and-att-still-selling-your-location-data-report-says/&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&amp;amp;T are [still] selling access to their customers' location data and that data is ending up in the hands of bounty hunters and others not authorized to possess it, letting them track most phones in the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carriers made further promises to stop selling the data and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/att-t-mobile-verizon-say-they-finally-stopped-selling-phone-location-data/&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; to the FCC that they had phased out the data-selling programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai's letter today did not say exactly which federal law the carriers broke, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/222&quot;&gt;Section 222&lt;/a&gt; of the Communications Act says that carriers may not use or disclose location information &quot;without the express prior authorization of the customer.&quot; Carriers have also been accused of violating rules on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/att-t-mobile-sprint-reportedly-broke-us-law-by-selling-911-location-data/&quot;&gt;usage of 911 location data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Huanan seafood market in Wuhan has been widely considered the source of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. But the virus may have infected people elsewhere first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;header class=&quot;article__header article__header--inline&quot; readability=&quot;26.605504587156&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/author/jon-cohen&quot;&gt;Jon Cohen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Jan. 26, 2020 , 11:25 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;As confirmed cases of a novel virus surge around the world with worrisome speed, all eyes have so far focused on a seafood market in Wuhan, China, as the origin of the outbreak. But a description of the first clinical cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday challenges that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. “No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011109036&quot;&gt;reports from Chinese health authorities&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011509040&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; had said the first patient had onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019—and those reports simply said “most” cases had links to the seafood market, which was closed on 1 January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;figure__hed&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Lucey asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt; paper’s data also raise questions about the accuracy of the initial information China provided, Lucey says. At the beginning of the outbreak, the main official source of public information were notices from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Its &lt;a href=&quot;http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011109035&quot;&gt;notices on 11 January&lt;/a&gt; started to refer to the 41 patients as the only confirmed cases and the count &lt;a href=&quot;http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011809064&quot;&gt;remained the same until 18 January&lt;/a&gt;. The notices did not state that the seafood market was the source, but they repeatedly noted that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that most cases linked to the market. Because the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission noted that diagnostic tests had confirmed these 41 cases by 10 January and officials presumably knew the case histories of each patient, “China must have realized the epidemic did not originate in that Wuhan Huanan seafood market,” Lucey tells &lt;cite&gt;Science&lt;/cite&gt;Insider. (Lucey also spoke about his concerns in an interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/01/25/wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov-qa-6-an-evidence-based-hypothesis/&quot;&gt;published online yesterday by Science Speaks&lt;/a&gt;, a project of the Infectious Disease Society of America.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the Scripps Research Institute who has analyzed sequences of 2019-nCoV to try to clarify its origin, says the 1 December timing of the first confirmed case was “an interesting tidbit” in &lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt; paper. “The scenario of somebody being infected outside the market and then later bringing it to the market is one of the three scenarios we have considered that is still consistent with the data,” he says. “It’s entirely plausible given our current data and knowledge.” The other two scenarios are that the origin was a group of infected animals or a single animal that came into that marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andersen posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://virological.org/t/clock-and-tmrca-based-on-27-genomes/347&quot;&gt;his analysis of 27 available genomes of 2019-nCoV&lt;/a&gt; on 25 January on a virology research website. It suggests they had a “most recent common ancestor”—meaning a common source—as early as 1 October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bin Cao of Capital Medical University, the corresponding author of &lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt; article and a pulmonary specialist, wrote in an email to &lt;cite&gt;Science&lt;/cite&gt;Insider that he and his co-authors “appreciate the criticism” from Lucey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now It seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,” he wrote. “But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucey notes that the discovery of the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, a sometimes fatal disease that occurs sporadically, came from a patient in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, although &lt;a href=&quot;http://applications.emro.who.int/emhj/v19/Supp1/EMHJ_2013_19_Supp1_S12_S18.pdf&quot;&gt;later studies traced it back&lt;/a&gt; to an earlier hospital outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Jordan in April 2012. Stored samples from two people who died in Jordan confirmed they had been infected with the virus. Retrospective analyses of blood samples in China from people and animals—including vendors from other animal markets—may reveal a clear picture of where the 2019-nCoV originated, he suggests. “There might be a clear signal among the noise,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Attorney General delays .org sale</title>
<link>https://domainnamewire.com/2020/01/31/breaking-california-attorney-general-delays-org-sale/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://domainnamewire.com/2020/01/31/breaking-california-attorney-general-delays-org-sale/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office that oversees California non-profits demands extensive documentation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-63236&quot; src=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/wp-content/breaking-news.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic that states 'breaking news'&quot; width=&quot;894&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; srcset=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/wp-content/breaking-news.jpg 894w, https://domainnamewire.com/wp-content/breaking-news-300x134.jpg 300w, https://domainnamewire.com/wp-content/breaking-news-768x342.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Attorney general has likely delayed approval of the .org sale to Ethos Capital by two months, if not more, after demanding extensive documentation from ICANN. The office supervises charitable organizations in California, where ICANN is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/correspondence/jeffrey-to-nevett-30jan20-en.pdf&quot;&gt;letter to ICANN&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), the attorney general has demanded responses to 35 questions and information requests. About half of the questions relate to ICANN’s decision to remove price caps on .org domain names. If it gets the answers it demands, it will get much more information than ICANN has previously disclosed about the process and thinking behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/2019/06/30/domain-overseer-lifts-all-price-caps-on-org-domain-names/&quot;&gt;removing price caps on .org domain names&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the attorney general may wish to speak to individual members of ICANN’s board about the price removals. It has asked for their names and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract between ICANN and Public Interest Registry states that ICANN is not permitted to disclose Public Interest Registry’s confidential information unless there is a valid court order or ICANN’s counsel believes the disclosure is required by applicable law. ICANN believes that applies in this case and intends to provide the unredacted information to the Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current deadline for ICANN to approve or deny the sale is February 20. It is asking Public Interest Registry to extend this to April 20 as a result of the attorney general office’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the biggest wrinkle so far in Internet Society’s plans to sell the registry for $1.135 billion to a private equity company. While many have weighed in, the California Attorney General may argue it has direct regulatory control over ICANN. It could also give ICANN a “reasonable” reason to deny the sale, depending on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

But Ubuntu 20.04's kernel has now back-ported WireGuard.&lt;p&gt;There has been the talk in recent weeks over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Ubuntu-20.04-Possible-WireGuard&quot;&gt;shipping Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with WireGuard support&lt;/a&gt; and indeed with Ubuntu's latest kernel in the Focal repository is the WireGuard module back-ported for this secure VPN tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back-porting WireGuard for the currently 5.4-based Ubuntu 20.04 LTS kernel is trivial thanks to the WireGuard out-of-tree module maintaining compatibility going back years. Now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/focal/commit/?h=master-next&amp;amp;id=026034ef5821d0b0aacebfa4f6a2472be3b7ed38&quot;&gt;the latest kernel build&lt;/a&gt; is the WireGuard module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So thankfully even with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS likely to be running on a Linux 5.5 kernel, WireGuard will be working for this long-term support release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/wireguard-tools&quot;&gt;Wireguard-Tools&lt;/a&gt; is available already within the Ubuntu universe archive for the user-space tools. NetworkManager and the like also already has WireGuard support in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is scheduled to ship on 23 April.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The EARN IT Act: how to ban end-to-end encryption without banning it</title>

<description>&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;10&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story so far:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the ‘90s the Internet was created.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;with apologies to Douglas Adams&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/lindsey-graham-proposal-could-expose-apple-facebook-to-lawsuits&quot;&gt;a new bill&lt;/a&gt; afoot in Congress called the EARN IT Act. A “discussion draft” released by Bloomberg is available as a PDF &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6746282/Earn-It.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This bill is trying to convert your anger at Big Tech into law enforcement’s long-desired dream of banning strong encryption. It is a bait-and-switch. Don’t fall for it. I’m going to explain where it came from, why it’s happening now, why it’s such an underhanded trick, and why it will not work for its stated purpose. And I’m only going to barely scratch the surface of the many, many problems with the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 1990s: Congress Passes Section 230 and CALEA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the 1990s, Congress passed several pieces of legislation that helped shape the Internet as we currently know it. Today I want to talk about two of them. One was Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230&quot;&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt; says, in essence, that online platforms (“providers” of “interactive computer services”) mostly can’t be held liable for the things their users say and do on the platform.&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; For example: If you defame me on Twitter, I can sue you for defamation, but I can’t sue Twitter. Without the immunity provided by Section 230, there might very well be no Twitter, or Facebook, or dating apps, or basically any website with a comments section. They would all have been sued out of existence, or never started up at all, in light of the potentially crushing legal liability to which they’d be exposed without Section 230. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The other significant law from the 1990s that I want to talk about today is the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, or CALEA for short. CALEA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/1002&quot;&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; telecommunications carriers (e.g., phone companies) to make their networks wiretappable for law enforcement. However, that mandate does not cover “information services”: websites, email, social media, chat apps, cloud storage, and so on. Put another way, the providers of “information services” are not required to design to be surveillance-friendly. Let’s call that the “information services carve-out” in CALEA. Plus, even covered entities are free to encrypt communications and throw away the keys to decrypt them. Let’s call that the “encryption carve-out.” As my colleague, veteran telecom lawyer Al Gidari, explained in a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2016/02/more-calea-and-why-it-trumps-fbis-all-writs-act-order&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, those carve-outs represent a compromise among competing interests, such as law enforcement, network security, privacy, civil liberties, and technological innovation. In the quarter-century since it was passed, CALEA has never been amended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In passing these two laws, Congress made a wise policy choice not to strangle the young Internet economic sector in its cradle. Exposing online services to crippling legal liability would (among other things) inhibit the free exchange of information and ideas; mandating that “information services” be surveillance-friendly to the U.S. government would (among other things) hurt their commercial viability in foreign markets. Congress chose instead to encourage innovation in the Internet and other new digital technologies. And the Internet bloomed. (&lt;em&gt;In the ‘90s the Internet was created&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Here in 2020, the Internet sector (and “tech” more broadly) is a huge economic driver in the U.S. Thanks in part to the efforts of U.S.-based companies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&quot;&gt;software has eaten the world&lt;/a&gt;. Billions of humans can connect with each other. And yet nobody really seems to enjoy being online very much anymore, because it turns out that humans are terrible. (&lt;em&gt;This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020: People Are Mad About Section 230&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Years of imbibing a concentrated font of human venality every time we open our phones, coupled with the metastatic growth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook&quot;&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, have birthed the current, bipartisan “techlash.” The techlash is taking several forms, among them the growing zeal for amending or outright repealing Section 230. The idea is that Section 230 is no longer needed; it’s served its original purpose, if anything it was too successful, and now U.S. tech companies have outgrown it -- and grown too big for their britches, period. The harm that Section 230 allows, the thinking goes, now outweighs the good, and so the time has come to hold providers accountable for that harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Of course, human terribleness wasn’t invented in the 21st century and it is not the Internet’s fault. If men were angels, no CALEA or Section 230 would have been necessary.&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theawl.com/2015/02/my-advice-to-young-people/&quot;&gt;Balk’s First Law&lt;/a&gt; holds, “Everything you hate about The Internet is actually everything you hate about people.” Section 230 has kept the providers of the former largely immune from being held accountable for the online abuse of the latter. But in the age of the techlash, that immunity has been slowly eroding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Unlike CALEA, Section 230 has been amended since it was passed: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stopsesta.org/&quot;&gt;SESTA/FOSTA&lt;/a&gt;, enacted in 2018, pierces providers’ immunity from civil and state-law claims about sex trafficking. Just as pretty much everybody predicted, SESTA/FOSTA has turned out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackinghustling.org/erased-the-impact-of-fosta-sesta-2020/&quot;&gt;endanger sex workers&lt;/a&gt; instead of protecting them, and is currently being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states&quot;&gt;challenged as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; in federal court (including by my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daphne-keller&quot;&gt;Daphne Keller&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now, riding on the “success” of SESTA/FOSTA, Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) (who were among SESTA/FOSTA’s early cosponsors in the Senate) are reportedly about to introduce another bill that would take another bite out of Section 230 immunity, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/7cedff&quot;&gt;The Information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/lindsey-graham-proposal-could-expose-apple-facebook-to-lawsuits&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. This time, the bill’s target is child sex abuse material (CSAM) online. The idea of the bill is to create a federal commission that will develop “best practices” for combatting CSAM online, which online service providers will have to follow or else risk losing Section 230 immunity as to CSAM claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This proposal does not arise in a regulatory vacuum. There’s already an existing federal statutory scheme criminalizing CSAM and imposing duties on providers. And it already allows providers to be held accountable for CSAM on their services, without any need to amend Section 230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal CSAM Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-110&quot;&gt;Federal law&lt;/a&gt;, specifically Chapter 110 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code (18 U.S.C. §§ 2251-2260A), already makes everything about CSAM a crime: producing, receiving, accessing, viewing, possessing, distributing, selling, importing, etc. If you do any of these things, the Department of Justice (DOJ) will prosecute you, and you may go to prison for many years. In addition to criminal penalties, Section 2255 of the law also authorizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2255&quot;&gt;civil lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; by victims of CSAM, so you could be sued by your victims in addition to going to prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Section 2258A of the law imposes duties on online service providers, such as Facebook and Tumblr and Dropbox and Gmail. The law mandates that providers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A&quot;&gt;must report&lt;/a&gt; CSAM when they discover it on their services, and then preserve what they’ve reported (because it’s evidence of a crime). Providers “who fail to comply with this obligation face substantial (and apparently criminal) penalties payable to the federal government.” U.S. v. Ackerman, 831 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (10th Cir. 2016).&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; The statute puts the Attorney General in charge of enforcing the reporting requirements for providers. Section 2258A was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ395/pdf/PLAW-115publ395.pdf&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; in late 2018 to expand providers’ reporting duties. Importantly, those duties, even after the expansion, do not include any duty to proactively monitor and filter content on the service to look for CSAM. Section 2258A only requires providers to report CSAM they “obtain[] actual knowledge of.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If providers report and preserve CSAM in accordance with the law, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258B&quot;&gt;they are protected&lt;/a&gt; from legal liability (both civil and criminal, in both federal and state court) for those actions.&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; This protection, found in Section 2258B, “insulates [providers] only when they ... pass evidence along to law enforcement and comply with its preservation instructions.” Ackerman, 831 F.3d at 1297. The safe harbor is not absolute: Section 2258B(b) disqualifies providers from protection under certain circumstances, such as if the provider engages in intentional misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Section 2258B safe harbor is not the same thing as Section 230 immunity. Section 230, as noted, has always had an exception for federal criminal law. In fact, the statutory text for that exception, Section 230(e)(1), expressly says, “Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the enforcement of … [chapter] 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of children) of title 18, or any other Federal criminal statute.” This exception is limited to criminal cases; civil claims against providers by CSAM victims under Section 2255 are still barred.&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Put simply, &lt;strong&gt;Section 230 does not keep federal prosecutors from holding providers accountable for CSAM on their services&lt;/strong&gt;. As Techdirt’s Mike Masnick &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/1220770207515344897?s=20&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, “not a single thing in CDA 230 stops the DOJ from doing anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As Section 2258A requires, providers do indeed report CSAM found on their services -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html&quot;&gt;45 million times&lt;/a&gt; last year alone, according to a high-profile September 2019 New York Times story. They’re complying with their mandatory reporting duties, or at least, nobody seems to be accusing them of noncompliance. If major tech companies were making a practice of flouting their duties under Section 2258A, the DOJ would be pursuing massive criminal penalties against them and it would be front-page news nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, despite providers’ apparent compliance with the law, law enforcement and child-safety organizations have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/olp/lawless-spaces-warrant-proof-encryption-and-its-impact-child-exploitation-cases&quot;&gt;been vocally asserting&lt;/a&gt; in recent months that providers aren’t doing enough to combat CSAM. Therefore, ostensibly to incentivize providers to do more, Senators Graham and Blumenthal have brought forth this new bill (which I’m assuming was drafted with significant input from DOJ and child-safety groups). The bill aims to hit providers where it hurts: their Section 230 immunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of the EARN IT Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Graham/Blumenthal bill’s core concept is reflected in its short title: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ashleyrgold/status/1218291639673933824&quot;&gt;“EARN IT Act”&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to make providers “earn” Section 230 immunity for CSAM claims, by complying with a set of guidelines that would be developed by an unelected commission and could be modified unilaterally by the Attorney General, but which are not actually binding law or rules set through any legislative or agency rulemaking process. There is a lot going on in this bill, but here is a very non-exhaustive list of just some of the bill’s salient features, with my quick analysis under them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.98070509766556&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;-0.90909090909091&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Providers of “interactive computer services” must “earn” Section 230 immunity for CSAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.4912060301508&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bill removes immunity as to civil &amp;amp; state criminal claims for CSAM only; would not remove 230 immunity generally (for other claims, e.g. defamation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0.97971014492754&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: “Interactive computer services” (ICSes) are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230&quot;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; in Section 230, and the bill does not change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The definition doesn’t include devices, but does apparently cover messaging services, though there are few court cases about that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Example: bill would cover WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Twitter DMs, but not iPhones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3.7707641196013&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: ICS providers also include email providers, cloud storage providers, etc. -- but this bill’s effect would mostly be to make them maintain the status quo, since email and cloud storage accounts already are typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT&quot;&gt;encrypted in such a way that they’re still accessible to law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Section 230 immunity for CSAM can be earned via 1 of 2 “safe harbors”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1: Compliance with “recommended” “best practices” for the prevention of online child exploitation conduct, TBD by a new 15-member commission &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: Encryption, particularly end-to-end encryption, is likely to be targeted as being contrary to “best practices” for preventing CSAM, because if a provider cannot “see” the contents of files on its service due to encryption, it is harder to detect CSAM files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The commission would include at least 4 law enforcement reps, 4 tech industry reps, 2 reps of child safety organizations, and 2 computer scientists/software engineering experts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The commission “shall consider” users’ interests in privacy, data security, and product quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: This is very weak language; it means the commission can “consider” these interests for a few seconds, chuckle to themselves, and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The commission recommends best practices to the Attorney General, who has the power to unilaterally change them before they’re finalized, as long as he writes up some reason for the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: This means the AG could single-handedly rewrite the “best practices” to state that any provider that offers end-to-end encryption is categorically excluded from taking advantage of this safe-harbor option. Or he could simply refuse to certify a set of best practices that aren’t sufficiently condemnatory of encryption. If the AG doesn’t finalize a set of best practices, then this entire safe-harbor option just vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A “best practice” requires the approval of only 10 of the 15 commission members in order to be recommended on to the AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: This means that the commission could totally ignore both of the computer scientists, or both of the child safety org reps, or all 4 tech industry reps, so long as it can hit the 10-person quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;An officer of the provider must certify compliance with the best practices; “knowing” false statements are a federal felony, carrying a fine and a 2-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2: Implementing other “reasonable measures” instead of the best practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Unlike certifying compliance with the prescribed best practices, which guarantees Section 230 immunity, taking the “reasonable measures” option is not a guaranteed way of “earning” immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: It’s not exactly a real “safe harbor” if the provider still has to litigate the 230 immunity question. Providers that can’t/won’t/don’t certify adherence to the “best practices” will have to take their chances on whether their chosen measures will be deemed “reasonable” by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Analysis: Would a court find end-to-end encryption to be “reasonable,” when the goal is not data security, but instead, combating CSAM? Providers would struggle to reconcile their duty to provide “reasonable” data security, as imposed by the FTC and dozens of state data-security laws, with a conflicting duty not to encrypt information because it’s “unreasonable” under the EARN IT Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EARN IT Act Has a Number of Serious Problems &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This bill has a number of extremely serious problems, too many to fit into one blog post. It is potentially unconstitutional under the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, for one thing. I have no hope of even enumerating all of the bill’s deficiencies. Instead, for now, let me list just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thanks to Section 230(e)(1), federal prosecutors can already hold providers accountable for CSAM on their services (even if state prosecutors and civil plaintiffs can’t). Piercing Section 230 immunity is not necessary if the idea is to penalize providers for their role in CSAM online, because the DOJ already has that power. If providers such as Facebook or Dropbox are breaking federal CSAM law, why isn’t DOJ prosecuting them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If those providers are complying with their duties under federal CSAM reporting law (Section 2258A), but DOJ and Congress still think they aren’t doing enough and should do even more than the law requires, why isn’t the answer to simply amend Section 2258A to add additional duties? Why bring Section 230 into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;14.828214471629&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;8.6743421052632&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The bill would, in effect, allow unaccountable commissioners to set best practices making it illegal for online service providers (for chat, email, cloud storage, etc.) to provide end-to-end encryption -- something it is currently 100% legal for them to do under existing federal law, specifically CALEA. That is, the bill would make providers liable under one law for exercising their legal rights under a different law. Why isn’t this conflict with CALEA acknowledged anywhere in the bill? (We saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justsecurity.org/30606/burr-feinstein-crypto-bill-terrible/#more-30606&quot;&gt;the exact same problem&lt;/a&gt; with the ill-fated Burr/Feinstein attempt to indirectly ban smartphone encryption.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The threat of losing Section 230 immunity will be scary to major tech companies such as Facebook that try in good faith to abide by federal CSAM law. But that threat will have no effect on the bad actors in the CSAM ecosystem: dark web sites devoted to CSAM, which already don’t usually qualify for Section 230 immunity because they have a direct hand in the illegal content on their sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If the good-faith platforms implement the new “best practices” to detect CSAM for fear of losing Section 230 immunity, but the bad actor CSAM sites don’t, then CSAM traders will leave the good-faith platforms for the bad ones, where they’ll be harder to track down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The CSAM traders who do stay on the good-faith platforms (say, Facebook) will still be able to encrypt CSAM before sending it through, say, Facebook Messenger, even if Facebook Messenger itself were to no longer have any end-to-end encryption functionality. Even if the EARN IT Act bans providers from offering end-to-end encryption, that won’t keep CSAM offenders from cloaking their activities with encryption. It will just move the place where the encryption happens to a different point in the process. File encryption technology is out there, and it’s been used by CSAM offenders for decades; the EARN IT Act bill can’t change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Let me say a little more about these problems. But first, I want to point out to you that if you believe this bill is about finally holding Big Tech accountable after it got too big for its britches under a permissive Section 230 regime, you are being had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EARN IT Act Is A Bait-And-Switch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While the EARN IT Act is ostensibly aimed at Section 230, it’s actually a sneaky way of affecting CALEA without directly amending it. Remember the two carve-outs in CALEA that I discussed above, for encryption and information services? Both DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/calea&quot;&gt;trying for at least a decade&lt;/a&gt; to close them. But Congress has shown no appetite for that. As said, CALEA has never once been amended in the quarter-century since it was passed. And even with the techlash in full swell, there isn’t a furious public frenzy over CALEA. Politicians know that many Americans are fed up with tech companies “hiding behind” Section 230 of the CDA. But nobody is saying, “I’m fed up with tech companies hiding behind Section 1002 of CALEA!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, how can law enforcement achieve its long-desired CALEA goal? By pushing a bill that talks about Section 230 instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;People are angry about Section 230, so the DOJ is seizing upon that anger as its opening to attack encryption. I’ve been saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2017/10/response-%E2%80%9Cresponsible-encryption%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;since 2017&lt;/a&gt; that federal law enforcement agencies would take advantage of anti-Big Tech sentiment to get their way on encryption. Now the techlash is strong enough that they’re finally making their move. The bill is ostensibly taking a shot at Section 230, but that shot will ultimately land on CALEA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Remember, CALEA makes it perfectly legal for providers of “information services” (such as Apple and Facebook) to design encryption that is not law enforcement-friendly. And even telco carriers can encrypt calls and throw away the decryption key. &lt;strong&gt;End-to-end encryption is legal under current federal law&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet the EARN IT Act would allow an unelected, unaccountable commission to write “best practices” (not actual laws or regulations, yet liability would result from failing to abide by them) which, make no mistake, will condemn end-to-end encryption. The commission, after all, would be acting in the shadow of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/10/william-barr-and-winnie-pooh&quot;&gt;an Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; who despises encryption. For Barr, encryption can only be a “worst practice.” By engaging in that “worst practice,” companies would risk facing the potentially ruinous tide of litigation that Section 230 presently bars. That is: the EARN IT Act would use &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; law -- a narrowed Section 230 -- to penalize providers for exercising their rights under a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; law -- CALEA. Providers would be held legally liable for doing exactly what federal law &lt;em&gt;permits&lt;/em&gt; them to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, providers are also evidently doing exactly what federal CSAM law &lt;em&gt;compels&lt;/em&gt; them to do (report CSAM). As said, nobody’s claiming providers are violating their reporting duties under Section 2258A. They’re doing as the law requires. If they weren’t, they could a&lt;strong&gt;lready&lt;/strong&gt; be held liable &lt;em&gt;under the existing law&lt;/em&gt;, and Section 230 wouldn’t save them. They’re not violating those reporting duties by providing end-to-end encryption (as permitted by CALEA). As said, under Section 2258A, providers need only report CSAM they &lt;em&gt;actually know&lt;/em&gt; about, and are under no duty to affirmatively look for CSAM by monitoring and filtering content. Nor are they under any duty to be able to “see” every piece of content on their service. If a provider doesn’t know about a piece of CSAM because it can’t “see” it due to end-to-end encryption, that does not run afoul of the CSAM reporting duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If Congress wants to cut off tech companies’ and telco carriers’ freedom to provide end-to-end encryption under CALEA’s two carve-outs, then Congress should write a bill that amends CALEA! Then we can have that conversation. If Congress wants providers to do more to fight CSAM, including something crazy like universal monitoring and filtering obligations, then Congress should write a bill that amends Section 2258A! Then we can have that conversation. But the EARN IT Act bill doesn’t do either of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The EARN IT Act bill is supposedly about CSAM, and it’s not-so-secretly about encryption. Yet it doesn’t amend the laws that are &lt;em&gt;actually relevant&lt;/em&gt; to those topics. Instead, it targets another law entirely, Section 230, largely because it’s politically expedient to do so right now. This bill is a cynical ploy to exploit current anti-Section 230 sentiment in order to achieve an unrelated anti-encryption goal (one which, by the way, would be disastrous for cybersecurity, privacy, the economy, national security, ...). Congress should not kill the freedom to encrypt by taking advantage of Section 230’s current unpopularity to get away with a bait-and-switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Amending 230 to affect CALEA is not the only bait-and-switch, though. Look closer: Why does law enforcement &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/07/william-barr-despises-your-power-keep-him-snooping-you&quot;&gt;hate end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt;? Because it renders &lt;em&gt;private conversations&lt;/em&gt; invisible to law enforcement (and to the provider of the messaging service). Now: Why is everyone mad about Section 230? &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; because of &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; conversations -- because of what's said &lt;em&gt;in public&lt;/em&gt;, in full view of law enforcement and the provider and everyone else. When people think of Section 230, they’re probably thinking of the horrible things they’ve seen in public tweets, Facebook posts, and every comments section ever -- the stuff that makes it no fun to be online anymore. They’re probably not thinking about private conversations over chat apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The vast majority of court cases involving Section 230 (where someone tries to sue a provider, but the case gets dismissed as barred by the statute) are defamation cases involving public online speech. Almost nobody is suing messaging providers because of something someone said in a private conversation. Section 230 has very, very rarely been invoked in that context,&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; and that’s not what motivates the law’s current unpopularity. Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;private conversations&lt;/em&gt; are the not-so-secret reason for the EARN IT Act proposal to amend Section 230. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In short: This bill takes popular rage at social media companies’ immunity under Section 230 for &lt;em&gt;public speech&lt;/em&gt; on their platforms, and twists it into a backhanded way of punishing messaging service providers’ use of encryption for &lt;em&gt;private conversations&lt;/em&gt;. That’s the deeper bait-and-switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Yes, this is about CSAM, not defamation or other less-egregious offenses. But it’s really solely about CSAM that occurs on end-to-end encrypted private messaging services. End-to-end encrypted private messaging is the only context where there’s any real need to threaten to punish providers for not doing enough about CSAM, because it’s the only context where providers don’t &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; report CSAM very frequently (because they can’t see the contents of end-to-end encrypted files; they can, of course, report CSAM where it’s reported to them by one of the “ends” of the communication). That 45 million reports number in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; story is testament to how often providers are already reporting -- and it makes it clear that it’s really only the specter of providers moving to encrypt more communications end-to-end (specifically, on Facebook Messenger) that is motivating this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If the goal is to get providers to do more about CSAM, then there is no need to threaten to strip Section 230 immunity for CSAM that’s posted in public contexts (such as a public tweet) or private messages that aren’t end-to-end encrypted (such as Twitter DMs), because providers &lt;em&gt;already report that&lt;/em&gt; in accordance with federal law. And if they violated federal criminal law, then as said, Section 230 wouldn’t save them. The purported rationale of incentivizing additional action on CSAM doesn’t bear up to scrutiny, because providers are already doing everything they are supposed to do (and indeed more than that), wherever they have the ability to “see” content. Ultimately, the problem this bill is really trying to solve isn’t inadequate provider action on CSAM. The “problem” is end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Put another way, the “problem” is that there isn’t currently a mandate on providers to ensure they can “see” every piece of content on their services, and to then affirmatively, proactively monitor and filter all of it. That is, the “problem” is that legislators haven’t yet tried to force providers to conduct total surveillance of every piece of information on their services. And rather than propose a law that explicitly demands total surveillance -- something that would force elected legislators, in an election year, to be accountable to their constituents for proposing it -- Senators Graham and Blumenthal are instead trying to duck accountability, hide behind Section 230’s unpopularity, and instead let an unelected, unaccountable baseball team’s worth of people (10 out of 15 commission members’ thumbs-up being the necessary minimum, as said) write “best practices” (again, &lt;em&gt;not actual laws&lt;/em&gt; or even rules subject to mandatory agency rulemaking processes) that can be unilaterally rewritten by Attorney General Barr however he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EARN IT Act Won’t Stop CSAM Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The really galling thing about this bill is that, like SESTA/FOSTA before it, it won’t work. All SESTA/FOSTA did was put sex workers in more danger by making it harder for them to screen clients and share information with one another. Similarly, the likely effect of the EARN IT Act would be to induce CSAM traders to make their actions harder to detect. For one, they could still encrypt their illegal files anyway, regardless of any “best practices” implemented by providers. For another, they’d be incentivized to move off of big, legitimate platforms such as Facebook, which are already acting in good faith and complying with current CSAM law, and shift to dark web sites whose entire raison d’etre is CSAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Threatening to curtail Section 230 immunity is only going to scare the good-faith providers. Those are the very ones &lt;em&gt;that are already complying with Section 2258A&lt;/em&gt; and could be expected to comply with any additional duties Congress cared to add to 2258A. But the immunity threat will have no effect on the services that do not comply and do not care. The sites that are dedicated to CSAM are directly violating federal CSAM law. They certainly aren’t following Section 2258A’s reporting requirements. That means they already &lt;em&gt;don’t qualify&lt;/em&gt; for Section 230 immunity. As Section 230(c)(1) states, Section 230 immunity bars attempts to treat providers as the publisher or speaker of information, such as CSAM, provided by &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt;. If a site helps to create or develop the illegal content, it is not eligible for the immunity. Put simply, Section 230 is not carte blanche for the &lt;em&gt;provider itself&lt;/em&gt; to violate the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since sites devoted to CSAM already don’t qualify for Section 230 immunity, threatening to take that immunity away unless they “earn it” under this new bill will have absolutely zero effect on them. CSAM traders, who are highly adaptable to shifts in law enforcement strategy, will know that and act accordingly. And they’ll be much harder to track down on dark web sites than they are when they’re using their Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Plus, the EARN IT Act won’t rid even the good-faith online services of CSAM. Even if there are “best practices” that induce a company not to provide end-to-end encryption, users can still encrypt files &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; transmitting them over the company’s service. Standalone file encryption software is already out there; that genie won’t go back in the bottle. Punishing the provider by stripping Section 230 immunity won’t fix this issue. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/1002&quot;&gt;Section 1002(b)(3)&lt;/a&gt; of CALEA recognizes, it makes no sense to try to hold a company responsible for an encrypted communication if the company wasn’t the one that provided the encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EARN It Act Gives More Power to a Creepy Attorney General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last but not least, the EARN IT Act gives AG Bill Barr the unchecked power to decide what “best practices” providers must implement if they want to guarantee that they’ll retain Section 230 immunity for CSAM.&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it#8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; He can make providers dance for him, and he calls the tune. There is approximately zero chance that Barr won’t use that unilateral authority to set “best practices” that undermine Americans’ communications privacy. Right now, encryption is perfectly legal, and it stymies Barr’s ability to illegally snoop en masse on Americans’ communications, like he did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/28/review-finds-phone-data-dragnet-dea-doj-began-without-legal-review/3299438002/&quot;&gt;the last time he was AG&lt;/a&gt;. This bill feels like it’s motivated by Barr’s wish to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200127/11491043807/is-william-barrs-latest-attack-section-230-simply-effort-to-harm-tech-companies-blocking-his-desire-to-kill-encryption.shtml&quot;&gt;punish providers&lt;/a&gt; for frustrating his creepy desire to spy on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But if he said that out loud, it wouldn’t go over well, so instead his punitive thirst is dressed up under the cover of Section 230, because Section 230 gets people riled up. He’s realized that if he invokes Section 230 in the current climate, he can get Americans to cut off their own nose to spite their face. He can get them to give away their entitlement to strong encryption that protects them from him, so long as they think that’ll stick it to Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; wrong with the EARN IT Act bill. I hope other members of civil society will chime in against this bill to explain these many other problems, because I’ve gone on long enough already and I’ve only addressed one tiny piece of why this bill is such a nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s understandable if you have misgivings about the breadth of Section 230. It’s okay to be angry at Big Tech. But don’t let Senators Graham and Blumenthal dupe you into believing that the EARN IT Act would provide any vindication for you against the major tech companies. The bill’s ultimate intent is to penalize those companies for protecting your privacy and data security. That’s something that tech companies have been legally allowed to do for a quarter-century, and we can’t afford to stop them from doing it. Encryption should be encouraged, not punished. If you value your privacy, if you value data security, or if you just don’t want to see our rogue Attorney General singlehandedly set the rules for the Internet, you’ll &lt;a href=&quot;https://whoismyrepresentative.com/&quot;&gt;contact your congressmembers&lt;/a&gt; and oppose the EARN IT Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-ae07302a-7fff-57e7-cd63-3ba4777285a1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; This is a bastardization of the opening lines of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Yes, I am aware that the Internet was not actually created in the ‘90s. Yes, I am aware that you think it should be “the internet” and not “the Internet.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; With regard to most civil and state criminal law claims, that is. Section 230 has always had a few exceptions, most significantly for federal criminal and intellectual property law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; With apologies to James Madison and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-51&quot;&gt;Federalist #51&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot; id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Ackerman&lt;/em&gt; case is mostly about Fourth Amendment issues that I won’t get into, at least not today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; Absent this safe harbor, providers are put in an untenable position, because CSAM is basically radioactive. Reporting CSAM by passing it along would otherwise be a crime, because transmitting CSAM is a crime; preserving CSAM as evidence would otherwise be a crime, too, because possessing CSAM is also a crime. Section 2258B was necessary to ensure that providers don’t have to face significant criminal liability for helping to fight CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot; id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; Although it expressly mentions the CSAM law, Section 230(e)(1)’s criminal-law exception does not allow Section 2255 civil claims against providers for CSAM content posted by users; at present, those are barred by Section 230’s broad immunity for civil claims. &lt;em&gt;MA ex rel. PK v. Village Voice Media Holdings&lt;/em&gt;, 809 F. Supp. 2d 1041, 1055-56 (E.D. Mo. 2011) (citing &lt;em&gt;Doe v. Bates&lt;/em&gt;, No. 5-cv-91, 2006 WL 3813758 (E.D.Tex. Dec. 27, 2006)). The EARN IT Act bill would change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot; id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; While courts have seldom addressed the applicability of Section 230 to private messaging services, a few courts have applied the law “to bar claims predicated on a defendant’s transmission of nonpublic messages, and have done so without questioning whether [Section 230] applies in such circumstances.” &lt;em&gt;Fields v. Twitter, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, 200 F. Supp. 3d 964, 975-76 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (citing &lt;em&gt;Hung Tan Phan v. Lang Van Pham&lt;/em&gt;, 182 Cal.App.4th 323, 324-28 (2010); &lt;em&gt;Delfino v. Agilent Techs., Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, 145 Cal.App.4th 790, 795-96, 804-08 (2006); &lt;em&gt;Beyond Sys., Inc. v. Keynetics, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, 422 F. Supp. 2d 523, 528, 536-37 (D. Md. 2006)), &lt;em&gt;aff’d&lt;/em&gt;, 881 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 2018). Thanks to Jeff Kosseff for pointing me to this authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot; id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; The bill also gives him the power to launch intrusive investigations of any company he can claim he believes isn’t abiding by its certification to those best practices, using a tool called “civil investigative demands” (CIDs), but I’m not even going to get into that.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How we pay attention changes the shape of our brains</title>
<link>https://lithub.com/how-we-pay-attention-changes-the-very-shape-of-our-brains/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lithub.com/how-we-pay-attention-changes-the-very-shape-of-our-brains/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine arriving at the airport just in time to catch a plane. Everything in your behavior betrays the heightened concentration of your attention. Your mind on alert, you look for the departures sign, without letting yourself be distracted by the flow of travelers; you quickly scroll through the list to find your flight. Advertisements all around call out to you, but you do not even see them—instead, you head straight for the check-in counter. Suddenly, you turn around: in the crowd, an unexpected friend just called your first name. This message, which your brain considers a priority, takes over your attention and invades your consciousness . . . making you forget which check-in counter you were supposed to go to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the space of a few minutes, your brain went through most of the key states of attention: vigilance and alertness, selection and distraction, orientation and filtering. In cognitive science, “attention” refers to all the mechanisms by which the brain selects information, amplifies it, channels it, and deepens its processing. These are ancient mechanisms in evolution: whenever a dog reorients its ears or a mouse freezes up upon hearing a cracking sound, they’re making use of attention circuits that are very close to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did attention mechanisms evolve in so many animal species? Because attention solves a very common problem: information saturation. Our brain is constantly bombarded with stimuli: the senses of sight, hearing, smell, and touch transmit millions of bits of information per second. Initially, all these messages are processed in parallel by distinct neurons—yet it would be impossible to digest them in depth: the brain’s resources would not suffice. This is why a pyramid of attention mechanisms, organized like a gigantic filter, carries out a selective triage. At each stage, our brain decides how much importance it should attribute to such and such input and allocates resources only to the information it considers most essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Attention is essential, but it may result in a problem: if attention is misdirected, learning can get stuck.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting relevant information is fundamental to learning. In the absence of attention, discovering a pattern in a pile of data is like looking for the fabled needle in a haystack. This is one of the main reasons behind the slowness of conventional artificial neural networks: they waste considerable time analyzing all possible combinations of the data provided to them, instead of sorting out the information and focusing on the relevant bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;insert-post-ads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Article continues after advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- /76722702/in_article_banner_2 --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only in 2014 that two researchers, Canadian Yoshua Bengio and Korean Kyunghyun Cho, showed how to integrate attention into artificial neural networks. Their first model learned to translate sentences from one language to another. They showed that attention brought in immense benefits: their system learned better and faster because it managed to focus on the relevant words of the original sentence at each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very quickly, the idea of learning to pay attention spread like wildfire in the field of artificial intelligence. Today, if artificial systems manage to successfully label a picture (“A woman throwing a Frisbee in a park”), it is because they use attention to channel the information by focusing a spotlight on each relevant part of the image. When describing the Frisbee, the network concentrates all its resources on the corresponding pixels of the image and temporarily removes all those which correspond to the person and the park—it will return to them later. Nowadays, any sophisticated artificial intelligence system no longer connects all inputs with all outputs—it knows that learning will be faster if such a plain network, where every pixel of the input has a chance to predict any word at the output, is replaced by an organized architecture where learning is broken down into two modules: one that learns to pay attention, and another that learns to name the data filtered by the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is essential, but it may result in a problem: if attention is misdirected, learning can get stuck. If I don’t pay attention to the Frisbee, this part of the image is wiped out: processing goes on as if it did not exist. Information about it is discarded early on, and it remains confined to the earliest sensory areas. Unattended objects cause only a modest activation that induces little or no learning. This is utterly different from the extraordinary amplification that occurs in our brain whenever we pay attention to an object and become aware of it. With conscious attention, the discharges of the sensory and conceptual neurons that code for an object are massively amplified and prolonged, and their messages propagate into the prefrontal cortex, where whole populations of neurons ignite and fire for a long time, well beyond the original duration of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a strong surge of neural firing is exactly what synapses need in order to change their strength—what neuroscientists call “long-term potentiation.” When a pupil pays conscious attention to, say, a foreign-language word that the teacher has just introduced, she allows that word to deeply propagate into her cortical circuits, all the way into the prefrontal cortex. As a result, that word has a much better chance of being remembered. Unconscious or unattended words remain largely confined to the brain’s sensory circuits, never getting a chance to reach the deeper lexical and conceptual representations that support comprehension and semantic memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;American psychologist Michael Posner distinguishes at least three major attention systems: Alerting; Orienting; and Executive Attention.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why every student should learn to pay attention—and also why teachers should pay more attention to attention! If students don’t attend to the right information, it is quite unlikely that they will learn anything. A teacher’s greatest talent consists of constantly channeling and capturing children’s attention in order to properly guide them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;insert-post-ads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Article continues after advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- /76722702/in_article_banner_3 --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention plays such a fundamental role in the selection of relevant information that it is present in many different circuits in the brain. American psychologist Michael Posner distinguishes at least three major attention systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Alerting, which indicates &lt;u&gt;when&lt;/u&gt; to attend, and adapts our level of vigilance.&lt;br/&gt;2. Orienting, which signals &lt;u&gt;what&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt; to attend to, and amplifies any object of interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Executive attention, which decides &lt;u&gt;how&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt; to process the attended information, selects the processes that are relevant to a given task, and controls their execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems massively modulate brain activity and can therefore facilitate learning, but also point it in the wrong direction. Let us examine them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attention system, perhaps the oldest in evolution, tells us &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;to be on the watch. It sends warning signals that mobilize the entire body when circumstances require it. When a predator approaches or when a strong emotion overwhelms us, a whole series of subcortical nuclei immediately increases the wakefulness and vigilance of the cortex. This system dictates a massive and diffuse release of neuromodulators such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine. Through long-range axons with many spread-out branches, these alerting messages reach virtually the entire cortex, greatly modulating cortical activity and learning. Some researchers speak of a “now print” signal, as if these messages directly tell the cortex to commit the current contents of neural activity into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments show that the firing of this warning system can indeed radically alter cortical maps. The American neurophysiologist Michael Merzenich conducted several experiments in which the alerting system of mice was tricked into action by electrical stimulation of their subcortical dopamine or acetylcholine circuits. The outcome was a massive shift in cortical maps. All the neurons that happened to be activated at that moment, even if they had no objective importance, were subject to intense amplification. When a sound, for instance, a high-pitched tone, was systematically associated with a flash of dopamine or acetylcholine, the mouse’s brain became heavily biased toward this stimulus. As a result, the whole auditory map was invaded by this arbitrary note. The mouse became better and better at discriminating sounds close to this sensitive note, but it partially lost the ability to represent other frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is remarkable that such cortical plasticity, induced by tampering with the alerting system, can occur even in adult animals. Analysis of the circuits involved shows that neuromodulators such as serotonin and acetylcholine—particularly via the nicotinic receptor (sensitive to nicotine, another major player in arousal and alertness)—modulate the firing of cortical inhibitory interneurons, tipping the balance between excitation and inhibition. Remember that inhibition plays a key role in the closing of sensitive periods for synaptic plasticity. Disinhibited by the alerting signals, cortical circuits seem to recover some of their juvenile plasticity, thus reopening the sensitive period for signals that the mouse brain labels as crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Far from reducing our ability to concentrate, video games can actually increase it. They are a powerful stimulant of attention.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;? It is tempting to think that a similar reorganization of cortical maps occurs every time a composer or a mathematician passionately dives into their chosen field, especially when their passion starts at an early age. A Mozart or a Ramanujan is perhaps so electrified by fervor that his brain maps become literally invaded with mental models of music or math. Furthermore, this may apply not only to geniuses, but to anyone passionate in their work, from a manual worker to a rocket scientist. By allowing cortical maps to massively reshape themselves, passion breeds talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though not everyone is a Mozart, the same brain circuits of alertness and motivation are present in all people. What circumstances of daily life would mobilize these circuits? Do they activate only in response to trauma or strong emotions? Maybe not. Some research suggests that video games, especially action games that play with life and death, provide a particularly effective means of engaging our attentional mechanisms. By mobilizing our alerting and reward systems, video games massively modulate learning. The dopamine circuit, for example, fires when we play an action game. Psychologist Daphné Bavelier has shown that this translates into rapid learning. The most violent action games seem to have the most intense effects, perhaps because they most strongly mobilize the brain’s alerting circuits. Ten hours of gameplay suffice to improve visual detection, refine the rapid estimation of the number of objects on the screen, and expand the capacity to concentrate on a target without being distracted. A video game player manages to make ultra-fast decisions without compromising his or her performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and teachers complain that today’s children, plugged into computers, tablets, consoles, and other devices, constantly zap from one activity to the next and have lost the capacity to concentrate—but this is untrue. Far from reducing our ability to concentrate, video games can actually increase it. In the future, will they help us remobilize synaptic plasticity in adults and children alike? Undoubtedly, they are a powerful stimulant of attention, which is why my laboratory has developed a whole range of educational tablet games for math and reading, based on cognitive science principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video games also have their dark side: they present well-known risks of social isolation, time loss, and addiction. Fortunately, there are many other ways to unlock the effects of the alerting system while also drawing on the brain’s social sense. Teachers who captivate their students, books that draw in their readers, and films and plays that transport their audiences and immerse them in real-life experiences probably provide equally powerful alerting signals that stimulate our brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second attention system in the brain determines &lt;em&gt;what &lt;/em&gt;we should attend to. This orienting system acts as a spotlight on the outside world. From the millions of stimuli that bombard us, it selects those to which we should allocate our mental resources, because they are urgent, dangerous, appealing . . . or merely relevant to our present goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding father of American psychology, William James (1842 – 1910), in his &lt;em&gt;The Principles of Psychology &lt;/em&gt;(1890), best defined this function of attention: “Millions of items of the outward order are present to my senses which never properly enter into my experience. Why? Because they have no interest for me. My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;Paying attention consists of suppressing unwanted information—and in doing so, our brain runs the risk of becoming blind to what it chooses not to see.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective attention operates in all sensory domains, even the most abstract. For example, we can pay attention to the sounds around us: dogs move their ears, but for us humans, only an internal pointer in our brain moves and tunes in to whatever we decide to focus on. At a noisy cocktail party, we are able to select one out of ten conversations based on voice and meaning. In vision, the orienting of attention is often more obvious: we generally move our head and eyes toward whatever attracts us. By shifting our gaze, we bring the object of interest into our fovea, which is an area of very high sensitivity in the center of our retina. However, experiments show that even without moving our eyes, we can still pay attention to any place or any object, wherever it is, and amplify its features. We can even attend to one of several superimposed drawings, just like we attend to one of several simultaneous conversations. And there is nothing stopping you from paying attention to the color of a painting, the shape of a curve, the speed of a runner, the style of a writer, or the technique of a painter. Any representation in our brains can become the focus of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, the effect is the same: the orienting of attention amplifies whatever lies in its spotlight. The neurons that encode the attended information increase their firing, while the noisy chattering of other neurons is squashed. The impact is twofold: attention makes the attended neurons more sensitive to the information that we consider relevant, but, above all, it increases their influence on the rest of the brain. Downstream neural circuits echo the stimulus to which we lend our eyes, ears, or mind. Ultimately, vast expanses of cortex reorient to encode whatever information lies at the center of our attention. Attention acts as an amplifier and a selective filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The art of paying attention, the great art,” says the philosopher Alain (1868–1951), “supposes the art of not paying attention, which is the royal art.” Indeed, paying attention also involves choosing what to ignore. For an object to come into the spotlight, thousands of others must remain in the shadows. To direct attention is to choose, filter, and select: this is why cognitive scientists speak of selective attention. This form of attention amplifies the signal which is selected, but it also dramatically reduces those that are deemed irrelevant. The technical term for this mechanism is “biased competition”: at any given moment, many sensory inputs compete for our brain’s resources, and attention biases this competition by strengthening the representation of the selected item while squashing the others. This is where the spotlight metaphor reaches its limits: to better light up a region of the cortex, the attentional spotlight of our brain also reduces the illumination of other regions. The mechanism relies on interfering waves of electrical activity: to suppress a brain area, the brain swamps it with slow waves in the alpha frequency band (between eight and twelve hertz), which inhibit a circuit by preventing it from developing coherent neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paying attention, therefore, consists of suppressing the unwanted information—and in doing so, our brain runs the risk of becoming blind to what it chooses not to see. Blind, really? Really. The term is fully appropriate, because many experiments, including the famous “invisible gorilla” experiment, demonstrate that inattention can induce a complete loss of sight. In this classic experiment, you are asked to watch a short movie where basketball players, dressed in black and white, pass a ball back and forth. Your task is to count, as precisely as you can, the number of passes of the white team. A piece of cake, you think—and indeed, 30 seconds later, you triumphantly give the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the experimenter asks a strange question: “Did you see the gorilla?” The gorilla? What gorilla? We rewind the tape, and to your amazement, you discover that an actor in a full-body gorilla costume walked across the stage and even stopped in the middle to pound on his chest for several seconds. It seems impossible to miss. Furthermore, experiments show that, at some point, your eyes looked right at the gorilla. Yet you did not see it. The reason is simple: your attention was entirely focused on the white team and therefore actively inhibited the distracting players who were dressed in black . . . gorilla included! Busy with the counting task, your mental workspace was unable to become aware of this incongruous creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invisible gorilla experiment is a landmark study in cognitive science, and one which is easily replicated: in a great variety of settings, the mere act of focusing our attention blinds us to unattended stimuli. If, for instance, I ask you to judge whether the pitch of a sound is high or low, you may become blind to another stimulus, such as a written word that appears within the next fraction of a second. Psychologists call this phenomenon the “attentional blink”: your eyes may remain open, but your mind “blinks”—for a short while, it is fully busy with its main task and utterly unable to attend to anything else, even something as simple as a single word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such experiments, we actually suffer from two distinct illusions. First, we fail to see the word or the gorilla, which is bad enough. (Other experiments show that inattention can lead us to miss a red light or run over a pedestrian—never use your cell phone behind the wheel!) But the second illusion is even worse: we are unaware of our own unawareness—and, therefore, we are absolutely convinced that we have seen all there is to see! Most people who try the invisible gorilla experiment cannot believe their own blindness. They think that we played a trick on them, for instance by using two different movies. Typically, their reasoning is that if there really was a gorilla in the video, they would have seen it. Unfortunately, this is false: our attention is extremely limited, and despite all our good will, when our thoughts are focused on one object, other objects—however salient, amusing, or important—can completely elude us and remain invisible to our eyes. The intrinsic limits of our awareness lead us to overestimate what we and others can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gorilla experiment truly deserves to be known by everyone, especially parents and teachers. When we teach, we tend to forget what it means to be ignorant. We all think that what we see, everyone can see. As a result, we often have a hard time understanding why a child, despite the best of intentions, fails to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, in the most literal sense of the term, what we are trying to teach him. But the gorilla heeds a clear message: seeing requires attending. If students, for one reason or another, are distracted and fail to pay attention, they may be entirely oblivious to their teacher’s message—and what they cannot perceive, they cannot learn.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UN special rapporteur on torture on his investigation into the case of Assange</title>

&lt;h2 data-css-153qrt7=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. The Swedish Police constructed a story of rape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-2&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nils Melzer, why is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/torture/srtorture/pages/nilsmelzer.aspx&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;interested in Julian Assange?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is something that the German Foreign Ministry recently asked me as well: Is that really your core mandate? Is Assange the victim of torture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-3&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your response?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The case falls into my mandate in three different ways: First, Assange published proof of systematic torture. But instead of those responsible for the torture, it is Assange who is being persecuted. Second, he himself has been ill-treated to the point that he is now exhibiting symptoms of psychological torture. And third, he is to be extradited to a country that holds people like him in prison conditions that Amnesty International has described as torture. In summary: Julian Assange uncovered torture, has been tortured himself and could be tortured to death in the United States. And a case like that isn’t supposed to be part of my area of responsibility? Beyond that, the case is of symbolic importance and affects every citizen of a democratic country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-4&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t you take up the case much earlier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a dark room. Suddenly, someone shines a light on the elephant in the room – on war criminals, on corruption. Assange is the man with the spotlight. The governments are briefly in shock, but then they turn the spotlight around with accusations of rape. It is a classic maneuver when it comes to manipulating public opinion. The elephant once again disappears into the darkness, behind the spotlight. And Assange becomes the focus of attention instead, and we start talking about whether Assange is skateboarding in the embassy or whether he is feeding his cat correctly. Suddenly, we all know that he is a rapist, a hacker, a spy and a narcissist. But the abuses and war crimes he uncovered fade into the darkness. I also lost my focus, despite my professional experience, which should have led me to be more vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Fifty weeks in prison for violating his bail: Julian Assange in January 2020 in a police van on the way to London’s maximum security Belmarsh prison. &lt;span data-css-puup3u=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dominic Lipinski/Press Association Images/Keystone&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-6&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start at the beginning: What led you to take up the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In December 2018, I was asked by his lawyers to intervene. I initially declined. I was overloaded with other petitions and wasn’t really familiar with the case. My impression, largely influenced by the media, was also colored by the prejudice that Julian Assange was somehow guilty and that he wanted to manipulate me. In March 2019, his lawyers approached me for a second time because indications were mounting that Assange would soon be expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy. They sent me a few key documents and a summary of the case and I figured that my professional integrity demanded that I at least take a look at the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-7&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It quickly became clear to me that something was wrong. That there was a contradiction that made no sense to me with my extensive legal experience: Why would a person be subject to nine years of a preliminary investigation for rape without charges ever having been filed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-8&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that unusual?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have never seen a comparable case. Anyone can trigger a preliminary investigation against anyone else by simply going to the police and accusing the other person of a crime. The Swedish authorities, though, were never interested in testimony from Assange. They intentionally left him in limbo. Just imagine being accused of rape for nine-and-a-half years by an entire state apparatus and by the media without ever being given the chance to defend yourself because no charges had ever been filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-9&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say that the Swedish authorities were never interested in testimony from Assange. But the media and government agencies have painted a completely different picture over the years: Julian Assange, they say, fled the Swedish judiciary in order to avoid being held accountable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s what I always thought, until I started investigating. The opposite is true. Assange reported to the Swedish authorities on several occasions because he wanted to respond to the accusations. But the authorities stonewalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-10&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you mean by that: «The authorities stonewalled?»&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allow me to start at the beginning. I speak fluent Swedish and was thus able to read all of the original documents. I could hardly believe my eyes: According to the testimony of the woman in question, a rape had never even taken place at all. And not only that: The woman’s testimony was later changed by the Stockholm police without her involvement in order to somehow make it sound like a possible rape. I have all the documents in my possession, the emails, the text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-11&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;«The woman’s testimony was later changed by the police» – how exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Aug. 20, 2010, a woman named S. W. entered a Stockholm police station together with a second woman named A. A. The first woman, S. W. said she had had consensual sex with Julian Assange, but he had not been wearing a condom. She said she was now concerned that she could be infected with HIV and wanted to know if she could force Assange to take an HIV test. She said she was really worried. The police wrote down her statement and immediately informed public prosecutors. Even before questioning could be completed, S. W. was informed that Assange would be arrested on suspicion of rape. S. W. was shocked and refused to continue with questioning. While still in the police station, she wrote a text message to a friend saying that she didn’t want to incriminate Assange, that she just wanted him to take an HIV test, but the police were apparently interested in «getting their hands on him.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-12&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.W. never accused Julian Assange of rape. She declined to participate in further questioning and went home. Nevertheless, two hours later, a headline appeared on the front page of Expressen, a Swedish tabloid, saying that Julian Assange was suspected of having committed two rapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-13&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two rapes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, because there was the second woman, A. A. She didn’t want to press charges either; she had merely accompanied S. W. to the police station. She wasn’t even questioned that day. She later said that Assange had sexually harassed her. I can’t say, of course, whether that is true or not. I can only point to the order of events: A woman walks into a police station. She doesn’t want to file a complaint but wants to demand an HIV test. The police then decide that this could be a case of rape and a matter for public prosecutors. The woman refuses to go along with that version of events and then goes home and writes a friend that it wasn’t her intention, but the police want to «get their hands on» Assange. Two hours later, the case is in the newspaper. As we know today, public prosecutors leaked it to the press – and they did so without even inviting Assange to make a statement. And the second woman, who had allegedly been raped according to the Aug. 20 headline, was only questioned on Aug. 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-14&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the second woman say when she was questioned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She said that she had made her apartment available to Assange, who was in Sweden for a conference. A small, one-room apartment. When Assange was in the apartment, she came home earlier than planned, but told him it was no problem and that the two of them could sleep in the same bed. That night, they had consensual sex, with a condom. But she said that during sex, Assange had intentionally broken the condom. If that is true, then it is, of course, a sexual offense – so-called «stealthing». But the woman also said that she only later noticed that the condom was broken. That is a contradiction that should absolutely have been clarified. If I don’t notice it, then I cannot know if the other intentionally broke it. Not a single trace of DNA from Assange or A. A. could be detected in the condom that was submitted as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-15&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the two women know each other?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They didn’t really know each other. A. A., who was hosting Assange and was serving as his press secretary, had met S. W. at an event where S. W. was wearing a pink cashmere sweater. She apparently knew from Assange that he was interested in a sexual encounter with S. W., because one evening, she received a text message from an acquaintance saying that he knew Assange was staying with her and that he, the acquaintance, would like to contact Assange. A. A. answered: Assange is apparently sleeping at the moment with the “cashmere girl.” The next morning, S. W. spoke with A. A. on the phone and said that she, too, had slept with Assange and was now concerned about having become infected with HIV. This concern was apparently a real one, because S.W. even went to a clinic for consultation. A. A. then suggested: Let’s go to the police – they can force Assange to get an HIV test. The two women, though, didn’t go to the closest police station, but to one quite far away where a friend of A. A.’s works as a policewoman – who then questioned S. W., initially in the presence of A. A., which isn’t proper practice. Up to this point, though, the only problem was at most a lack of professionalism. The willful malevolence of the authorities only became apparent when they immediately disseminated the suspicion of rape via the tabloid press, and did so without questioning A. A. and in contradiction to the statement given by S. W. It also violated a clear ban in Swedish law against releasing the names of alleged victims or perpetrators in sexual offense cases. The case now came to the attention of the chief public prosecutor in the capital city and she suspended the rape investigation some days later with the assessment that while the statements from S. W. were credible, there was no evidence that a crime had been committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-16&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But then the case really took off. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the supervisor of the policewoman who had conducted the questioning wrote her an email telling her to rewrite the statement from S. W.&lt;/p&gt;

The original copies of the mail exchanges between the Swedish police.

We only know that the original statement, according to the chief public prosecutor, apparently did not contain any indication that a crime had been committed. In the edited form it says that the two had had sex several times – consensual and with a condom. But in the morning, according to the revised statement, the woman woke up because he tried to penetrate her without a condom. She asks: «Are you wearing a condom?» He says: «No.» Then she says: «You better not have HIV» and allows him to continue. The statement was edited without the involvement of the woman in question and it wasn’t signed by her. It is a manipulated piece of evidence out of which the Swedish authorities then constructed a story of rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-19&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why would the Swedish authorities do something like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timing is decisive: In late July, Wikileaks – in cooperation with the «New York Times», the «&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-war-logs&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;» and «Der Spiegel» – published the «&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;Afghan War Diary&lt;/a&gt;». It was one of the largest leaks in the history of the U.S. military. The U.S. immediately demanded that its allies inundate Assange with criminal cases. We aren’t familiar with all of the correspondence, but Stratfor, a security consultancy that works for the U.S. government, advised American officials apparently to deluge Assange &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/10/1056763_re-discussion-assange-arrested-.html&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;with all kinds of criminal cases for the next 25 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-css-153qrt7=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Assange contacts the Swedish judiciary several times to make a statement – but he is turned down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-21&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t Assange turn himself into the police at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He did. I mentioned that earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;0-22&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then please elaborate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assange learned about the rape allegations from the press. He established contact with the police so he could make a statement. Despite the scandal having reached the public, he was only allowed to do so nine days later, after the accusation that he had raped S. W. was no longer being pursued. But proceedings related to the sexual harassment of A. A. were ongoing. On Aug. 30, 2010, Assange appeared at the police station to make a statement. He was questioned by the same policeman who had since ordered that revision of the statement had been given by S. W. At the beginning of the conversation, Assange said he was ready to make a statement, but added that he didn’t want to read about his statement again in the press. That is his right, and he was given assurances it would be granted. But that same evening, everything was in the newspapers again. It could only have come from the authorities because nobody else was present during his questioning. The intention was very clearly that of besmirching his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-css-88vvl0=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;344.61059584036&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-0&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did the story come from that Assange was seeking to avoid Swedish justice officials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version was manufactured, but it is not consistent with the facts. Had he been trying to hide, he would not have appeared at the police station of his own free will. On the basis of the revised statement from S.W., an appeal was filed against the public prosecutor’s attempt to suspend the investigation, and on Sept. 2, 2010, the rape proceedings were resumed. A legal representative by the name of Claes Borgström was appointed to the two women at public cost. The man was a law firm partner to the previous justice minister, Thomas Bodström, under whose supervision Swedish security personnel had seized two men who the U.S. found suspicious in the middle of Stockholm. The men were seized without any kind of legal proceedings and then handed over to the CIA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.se/20090119/17020&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;who proceeded to torture them&lt;/a&gt;. That shows the trans-Atlantic backdrop to this affair more clearly. After the resumption of the rape investigation, Assange repeatedly indicated through his lawyer that he wished to respond to the accusations. The public prosecutor responsible kept delaying. On one occasion, it didn’t fit with the public prosecutor’s schedule, on another, the police official responsible was sick. Three weeks later, his lawyer finally wrote that Assange really had to go to Berlin for a conference and asked if he was allowed to leave the country. The public prosecutor’s office gave him written permission to leave Sweden for short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-1&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point is: On the day that Julian Assange left Sweden, at a point in time when it wasn’t clear if he was leaving for a short time or a long time, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He flew with Scandinavian Airlines from Stockholm to Berlin. During the flight, his laptops disappeared from his checked baggage. When he arrived in Berlin, Lufthansa requested an investigation from SAS, but the airline apparently declined to provide any information at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-2&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is exactly the problem. In this case, things are constantly happening that shouldn’t actually be possible unless you look at them from a different angle. Assange, in any case, continued onward to London, but did not seek to hide from the judiciary. Via his Swedish lawyer, he offered public prosecutors several possible dates for questioning in Sweden – this correspondence exists. Then, the following happened: Assange caught wind of the fact that a secret criminal case had been opened against him in the U.S. At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/13/wikileaks.investigation/index.html&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;it was not confirmed by the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, but today we know that it was true. As of that moment, Assange’s lawyer began saying that his client was prepared to testify in Sweden, but he demanded diplomatic assurance that Sweden would not extradite him to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-3&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was that even a realistic scenario?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely. Some years previously, as I already mentioned, Swedish security personnel had handed over two asylum applicants, both of whom were registered in Sweden, to the CIA without any legal proceedings. The abuse already started at the Stockholm airport, where they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/eu0107/7.htm&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;mistreated, drugged and flown to Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, where they were tortured. We don’t know if they were the only such cases. But we are aware of these cases because the men survived. Both later filed complaints with UN human rights agencies and won their case. Sweden was forced to pay each of them half a million dollars in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-4&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did Sweden agree to the demands submitted by Assange?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lawyers say that during the nearly seven years in which Assange lived in the Ecuadorian Embassy, they made over 30 offers to arrange for Assange to visit Sweden – in exchange for a guarantee that he would not be extradited to the U.S. The Swedes declined to provide such a guarantee by arguing that the U.S. had not made a formal request for extradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-5&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your view of the demand made by Assange’s lawyers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such diplomatic assurances are a routine international practice. People request assurances that they won’t be extradited to places where there is a danger of serious human rights violations, completely irrespective of whether an extradition request has been filed by the country in question or not. It is a political procedure, not a legal one. Here’s an example: Say France demands that Switzerland extradite a Kazakh businessman who lives in Switzerland but who is wanted by both France and Kazakhstan on tax fraud allegations. Switzerland sees no danger of torture in France, but does believe such a danger exists in Kazakhstan. So, Switzerland tells France: We’ll extradite the man to you, but we want a diplomatic assurance that he won’t be extradited onward to Kazakhstan. The French response is not: «Kazakhstan hasn’t even filed a request!» Rather, they would, of course, grant such an assurance. The arguments coming from Sweden were tenuous at best. That is one part of it. The other, and I say this on the strength of all of my experience behind the scenes of standard international practice: If a country refuses to provide such a diplomatic assurance, then all doubts about the good intentions of the country in question are justified. Why shouldn’t Sweden provide such assurances? From a legal perspective, after all, the U.S. has absolutely nothing to do with Swedish sex offense proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-6&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t Sweden want to offer such an assurance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just have to look at how the case was run: For Sweden, it was never about the interests of the two women. Even after his request for assurances that he would not be extradited, Assange still wanted to testify. He said: If you cannot guarantee that I won’t be extradited, then I am willing to be questioned in London or via video link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-7&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it normal, or even legally acceptable, for Swedish authorities to travel to a different country for such an interrogation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is a further indication that Sweden was never interested in finding the truth. For exactly these kinds of judiciary issues, there is a cooperation treaty between the United Kingdom and Sweden, which foresees that Swedish officials can travel to the UK, or vice versa, to conduct interrogations or that such questioning can take place via video link. During the period of time in question, such questioning between Sweden and England took place in 44 other cases. It was only in Julian Assange’s case that Sweden insisted that it was essential for him to appear in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-css-153qrt7=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. When the highest Swedish court finally forced public prosecutors in Stockholm to either file charges or suspend the case, the British authorities demanded: «Don’t get cold feet!!»&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-9&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only a single explanation for everything – for the refusal to grant diplomatic assurances, for the refusal to question him in London: They wanted to apprehend him so they could extradite him to the U.S. The number of breaches of law that accumulated in Sweden within just a few weeks during the preliminary criminal investigation is simply grotesque. The state assigned a legal adviser to the women who told them that the criminal interpretation of what they experienced was up to the state, and no longer up to them. When their legal adviser was asked about contradictions between the women’s testimony and the narrative adhered to by public officials, the legal adviser said, in reference to the women: «ah, but they’re not lawyers.» In the second case – the rape case manufactured by the authorities, to which a 10-year statute of limitations applies – Assange’s lawyers petitioned Sweden’s highest court to force public prosecutors to either finally press charges or suspend the case. When the Swedes told the UK that they may be forced to abandon the case, the British wrote back, worriedly: «Don’t you dare get cold feet!!»&lt;/p&gt;

«Don’t you dare get cold feet!!»: Mail from the English law enforcement agency CPS to the Swedish Chief Prosecutor Marianne Ny. This Document was obtained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SMaurizi&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;the Italian investigative journalist, Stefania Maurizi&lt;/a&gt;, in a five-year long FOIA litigation which is still ongoing.

Though really, the English should have been happy that they would no longer have to spend millions in taxpayer money to keep the Ecuadorian Embassy under constant surveillance to prevent Assange’s escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-12&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were the British so eager to prevent the Swedes from closing the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have to stop believing that there was really an interest in leading an investigation into a sexual offense. What Wikileaks did is a threat to the political elite in the U.S., Britain, France and Russia in equal measure. Wikileaks publishes secret state information – they are opposed to classification. And in a world, even in so-called mature democracies, where secrecy has become rampant, that is seen as a fundamental threat. Assange made it clear that countries are no longer interested today in legitimate confidentiality, but in the suppression of important information about corruption and crimes. Take the archetypal Wikileaks case from the leaks supplied by Chelsea Manning: The so-called «Collateral Murder» video. &lt;em&gt;(Eds. Note: On April 5, 2010, Wikileaks&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;published a classified video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;from the U.S. military which showed the murder of several people in Baghdad by U.S. soldiers, including two employees of the news agency Reuters.)&lt;/em&gt; As a long-time legal adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross and delegate in war zones, I can tell you: The video undoubtedly documents a war crime. A helicopter crew simply mowed down a bunch of people. It could even be that one or two of these people was carrying a weapon, but injured people were intentionally targeted. That is a war crime. «He’s wounded,» you can hear one American saying. «I’m firing.» And then they laugh. Then a van drives up to save the wounded. The driver has two children with him. You can hear the soldiers say: Well it’s their fault for bringing their kids into a battle. And then they open fire. The father and the wounded are immediately killed, though the children survive with serious injuries. Through the publication of the video, we became direct witnesses to a criminal, unconscionable massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-13&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should a constitutional democracy do in such a situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A constitutional democracy would probably investigate Chelsea Manning for violating official secrecy because she passed the video along to Assange. But it certainly wouldn’t go after Assange, because he published the video in the public interest, consistent with the practices of classic investigative journalism. More than anything, though, a constitutional democracy would investigate and punish the war criminals. These soldiers belong behind bars. But no criminal investigation was launched into a single one of them. Instead, the man who informed the public is locked away in pre-extradition detention in London and is facing a possible sentence in the U.S. of up to 175 years in prison. That is a completely absurd sentence. By comparison: The main war criminals in the Yugoslavia tribunal received sentences of 45 years. One-hundred-seventy-five years in prison in conditions that have been found to be inhumane by the UN Special Rapporteur and by Amnesty International. But the really horrifying thing about this case is the lawlessness that has developed: The powerful can kill without fear of punishment and journalism is transformed into espionage. It is becoming a crime to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Nils Melzer: «Let's see where we will be in 20 years if Assange is convicted – what you will still be able to write then as a journalist. I am convinced that we are in serious danger of losing press freedoms.»
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-15&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What awaits Assange once he is extradited?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He will not receive a trial consistent with the rule of law. That’s another reason why his extradition shouldn’t be allowed. Assange will receive a trial-by-jury in Alexandria, Virginia – the notorious «Espionage Court» where the U.S. tries all national security cases. The choice of location is not by coincidence, because the jury members must be chosen in proportion to the local population, and 85 percent of Alexandria residents work in the national security community – at the CIA, the NSA, the Defense Department and the State Department. When people are tried for harming national security in front of a jury like that, the verdict is clear from the very beginning. The cases are always tried in front of the same judge behind closed doors and on the strength of classified evidence. Nobody has ever been acquitted there in a case like that. The result being that most defendants reach a settlement, in which they admit to partial guilt so as to receive a milder sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-16&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are saying that Julian Assange won’t receive a fair trial in the United States?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without doubt. For as long as employees of the American government obey the orders of their superiors, they can participate in wars of aggression, war crimes and torture knowing full well that they will never have to answer to their actions. What happened to the lessons learned in the Nuremberg Trials? I have worked long enough in conflict zones to know that mistakes happen in war. It’s not always unscrupulous criminal acts. A lot of it is the result of stress, exhaustion and panic. That’s why I can absolutely understand when a government says: We’ll bring the truth to light and we, as a state, take full responsibility for the harm caused, but if blame cannot be directly assigned to individuals, we will not be imposing draconian punishments. But it is extremely dangerous when the truth is suppressed and criminals are not brought to justice. In the 1930s, Germany and Japan left the League of Nations. Fifteen years later, the world lay in ruins. Today, the U.S. has withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, and neither the «Collateral Murder» massacre nor the CIA torture following 9/11 nor the war of aggression against Iraq have led to criminal investigations. Now, the United Kingdom is following that example. The Security and Intelligence Committee in the country’s own parliament published two extensive reports in 2018 showing that Britain was much more deeply involved in the secret CIA torture program than previously believed. The committee recommended a formal investigation. The first thing that Boris Johnson did after he became prime minister was to annul that investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-css-153qrt7=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. In the UK, violations of bail conditions are generally only punished with monetary fines or, at most, a couple of days behind bars. But Assange was given 50 weeks in a maximum-security prison without the ability to prepare his own defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-18&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In April, Julian Assange was dragged out of the Ecuadorian Embassy by British police. What is your view of these events?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, a new government was elected in Ecuador. In response, the U.S. wrote a letter indicating they were eager to cooperate with Ecuador. There was, of course, a lot of money at stake, but there was one hurdle in the way: Julian Assange. The message was that the U.S. was prepared to cooperate if Ecuador handed Assange over to the U.S. At that point, the Ecuadorian Embassy began ratcheting up the pressure on Assange. They made his life difficult. But he stayed. Then Ecuador voided his amnesty and gave Britain a green light to arrest him. Because the previous government had granted him Ecuadorian citizenship, Assange’s passport also had to be revoked, because the Ecuadorian constitution forbids the extradition of its own citizens. All that took place overnight and without any legal proceedings. Assange had no opportunity to make a statement or have recourse to legal remedy. He was arrested by the British and taken before a British judge that same day, who convicted him of violating his bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-19&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you make of this accelerated verdict?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assange only had 15 minutes to prepare with his lawyer. The trial itself also lasted just 15 minutes. Assange’s lawyer plopped a thick file down on the table and made a formal objection to one of the judges for conflict of interest because her husband had been the subject of Wikileaks exposures in 35 instances. But the lead judge brushed aside the concerns without examining them further. He said accusing his colleague of a conflict of interest was an affront. Assange himself only uttered one sentence during the entire proceedings: «I plead not guilty.» The judge turned to him and said: «You are a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own self-interest. I convict you for bail violation.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-20&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I understand you correctly: Julian Assange never had a chance from the very beginning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s the point. I’m not saying Julian Assange is an angel or a hero. But he doesn’t have to be. We are talking about human rights and not about the rights of heroes or angels. Assange is a person, and he has the right to defend himself and to be treated in a humane manner. Regardless of what he is accused of, Assange has the right to a fair trial. But he has been deliberately denied that right – in Sweden, the U.S., Britain and Ecuador. Instead, he was left to rot for nearly seven years in limbo in a room. Then, he was suddenly dragged out and convicted within hours and without any preparation for a bail violation that consisted of him having received diplomatic asylum from another UN member state on the basis of political persecution, just as international law intends and just as countless Chinese, Russian and other dissidents have done in Western embassies. It is obvious that what we are dealing with here is political persecution. In Britain, bail violations seldom lead to prison sentences – they are generally subject only to fines. Assange, by contrast, was sentenced in summary proceedings to 50 weeks in a maximum-security prison – clearly a disproportionate penalty that had only a single purpose: Holding Assange long enough for the U.S. to prepare their espionage case against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-21&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, what do you have to say about his current conditions of imprisonment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Britain has denied Julian Assange contact with his lawyers in the U.S., where he is the subject of secret proceedings. His British lawyer has also complained that she hasn’t even had sufficient access to her client to go over court documents and evidence with him. Into October, he was not allowed to have a single document from his case file with him in his cell. He was denied his fundamental right to prepare his own defense, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. On top of that is the almost total solitary confinement and the totally disproportionate punishment for a bail violation. As soon as he would leave his cell, the corridors were emptied to prevent him from having contact with any other inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-22&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And all that because of a simple bail violation? At what point does imprisonment become torture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Julian Assange has been intentionally psychologically tortured by Sweden, Britain, Ecuador and the U.S. First through the highly arbitrary handling of proceedings against him. The way Sweden pursued the case, with active assistance from Britain, was aimed at putting him under pressure and trapping him in the embassy. Sweden was never interested in finding the truth and helping these women, but in pushing Assange into a corner. It has been an abuse of judicial processes aimed at pushing a person into a position where he is unable to defend himself. On top of that come the surveillance measures, the insults, the indignities and the attacks by politicians from these countries, up to and including death threats. This constant abuse of state power has triggered serious stress and anxiety in Assange and has resulted in measurable cognitive and neurological harm. I visited Assange in his cell in London in May 2019 together with two experienced, widely respected doctors who are specialized in the forensic and psychological examination of torture victims. The diagnosis arrived at by the two doctors was clear: Julian Assange displays the typical symptoms of psychological torture. If he doesn’t receive protection soon, a rapid deterioration of his health is likely, and death could be one outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-23&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half a year after Assange was placed in pre-extradition detention in Britain, Sweden quietly abandoned the case against him in November 2019, after nine long years. Why then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swedish state spent almost a decade intentionally presenting Julian Assange to the public as a sex offender. Then, they suddenly abandoned the case against him on the strength of the same argument that the first Stockholm prosecutor used in 2010, when she initially suspended the investigation after just five days: While the woman’s statement was credible, there was no proof that a crime had been committed. It is an unbelievable scandal. But the timing was no accident. On Nov. 11, an official document that I had sent to the Swedish government two months before was made public. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=24838&quot; data-css-9r2oe9=&quot;&quot; data-css-1exity3=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the document&lt;/a&gt;, I made a request to the Swedish government to provide explanations for around 50 points pertaining to the human rights implications of the way they were handling the case. How is it possible that the press was immediately informed despite the prohibition against doing so? How is it possible that a suspicion was made public even though the questioning hadn’t yet taken place? How is it possible for you to say that a rape occurred even though the woman involved contests that version of events? On the day the document was made public, I received a paltry response from Sweden: The government has no further comment on this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-24&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that answer mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an admission of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-25&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How so?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As UN Special Rapporteur, I have been tasked by the international community of nations with looking into complaints lodged by victims of torture and, if necessary, with requesting explanations or investigations from governments. That is the daily work I do with all UN member states. From my experience, I can say that countries that act in good faith are almost always interested in supplying me with the answers I need to highlight the legality of their behavior. When a country like Sweden declines to answer questions submitted by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, it shows that the government is aware of the illegality of its behavior and wants to take no responsibility for its behavior. They pulled the plug and abandoned the case a week later because they knew I would not back down. When countries like Sweden allow themselves to be manipulated like that, then our democracies and our human rights face a fundamental threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-26&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You believe that Sweden was fully aware of what it was doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. From my perspective, Sweden very clearly acted in bad faith. Had they acted in good faith, there would have been no reason to refuse to answer my questions. The same holds true for the British: Following my visit to Assange in May 2019, they took six months to answer me – in a single-page letter, which was primarily limited to rejecting all accusations of torture and all inconsistencies in the legal proceedings. If you’re going to play games like that, then what’s the point of my mandate? I am the Special Rapporteur on Torture for the United Nations. I have a mandate to ask clear questions and to demand answers. What is the legal basis for denying someone their fundamental right to defend themselves? Why is a man who is neither dangerous nor violent held in solitary confinement for several months when UN standards legally prohibit solitary confinement for periods extending beyond 15 days? None of these UN member states launched an investigation, nor did they answer my questions or even demonstrate an interest in dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-css-153qrt7=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. A prison sentence of 175 years for investigative journalism: The precedent the USA vs. Julian Assange case could set&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-28&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean when UN member states refuse to provide information to their own Special Rapporteur on Torture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That it is a prearranged affair. A show trial is to be used to make an example of Julian Assange. The point is to intimidate other journalists. Intimidation, by the way, is one of the primary purposes for the use of torture around the world. The message to all of us is: This is what will happen to you if you emulate the Wikileaks model. It is a model that is so dangerous because it is so simple: People who obtain sensitive information from their governments or companies transfer that information to Wikileaks, but the whistleblower remains anonymous. The reaction shows how great the threat is perceived to be: Four democratic countries joined forces – the U.S., Ecuador, Sweden and the UK – to leverage their power to portray one man as a monster so that he could later be burned at the stake without any outcry. The case is a huge scandal and represents the failure of Western rule of law. If Julian Assange is convicted, it will be a death sentence for freedom of the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-29&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would this possible precedent mean for the future of journalism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a practical level, it means that you, as a journalist, must now defend yourself. Because if investigative journalism is classified as espionage and can be incriminated around the world, then censorship and tyranny will follow. A murderous system is being created before our very eyes. War crimes and torture are not being prosecuted. YouTube videos are circulating in which American soldiers brag about driving Iraqi women to suicide with systematic rape. Nobody is investigating it. At the same time, a person who exposes such things is being threatened with 175 years in prison. For an entire decade, he has been inundated with accusations that cannot be proven and are breaking him. And nobody is being held accountable. Nobody is taking responsibility. It marks an erosion of the social contract. We give countries power and delegate it to governments – but in return, they must be held accountable for how they exercise that power. If we don’t demand that they be held accountable, we will lose our rights sooner or later. Humans are not democratic by their nature. Power corrupts if it is not monitored. Corruption is the result if we do not insist that power be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
«It has been an abuse of judicial processes aimed at pushing a person into a position where he is unable to defend himself.»
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-31&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re saying that the targeting of Assange threatens the very core of press freedoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let’s see where we will be in 20 years if Assange is convicted – what you will still be able to write then as a journalist. I am convinced that we are in serious danger of losing press freedoms. It’s already happening: Suddenly, the headquarters of ABC News in Australia was raided in connection with the «Afghan War Diary». The reason? Once again, the press uncovered misconduct by representatives of the state. In order for the division of powers to work, the state must be monitored by the press as the fourth estate. WikiLeaks is a the logical consequence of an ongoing process of expanded secrecy: If the truth can no longer be examined because everything is kept secret, if investigation reports on the U.S. government’s torture policy are kept secret and when even large sections of the published summary are redacted, leaks are at some point inevitably the result. WikiLeaks is the consequence of rampant secrecy and reflects the lack of transparency in our modern political system. There are, of course, areas where secrecy can be vital. But if we no longer know what our governments are doing and the criteria they are following, if crimes are no longer being investigated, then it represents a grave danger to societal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pos=&quot;2-32&quot; data-css-aphf9g=&quot;&quot; data-css-qc9yqx=&quot;&quot; data-css-1ax1725=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the consequences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and, before that, as a Red Cross delegate, I have seen lots of horrors and violence and have seen how quickly peaceful countries like Yugoslavia or Rwanda can transform into infernos. At the roots of such developments are always a lack of transparency and unbridled political or economic power combined with the naivete, indifference and malleability of the population. Suddenly, that which always happened to the other – unpunished torture, rape, expulsion and murder – can just as easily happen to us or our children. And nobody will care. I can promise you that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;My second year was a huge improvement financially. I increased profits by $18.5k!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I still lost money, but try not to get too hung up on that. I tripled revenue to $7.2k and cut expenses by more than half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-afford-to-keep-losing-money&quot;&gt;How can you afford to keep losing money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-term unprofitability often perplexes people. They assume I fund my money-losing endeavors with freelance work, but the truth is that 100% of my working hours go into my non-lucrative businesses. This is possible due to three main factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low expenses&lt;/strong&gt;: I have no children and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-1/#so-i-bought-a-house&quot;&gt;live in an inexpensive area&lt;/a&gt; where my costs are ~$2k/month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High savings&lt;/strong&gt;: It's hard to work for big software companies for 11 years without building a decent nest egg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucky investments&lt;/strong&gt;: Throughout my career, most of my money has been in the S&amp;amp;P 500 during periods of especially strong market runs. My small bets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/tags/sia/&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; also paid off well.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zestful is a SaaS for parsing recipe ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zestful launched in mid-2018 as my first attempt at a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. It allows food apps to recognize the structure of recipe ingredients. Given an ingredient like, “2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley,” Zestful infers that &lt;code&gt;2.5&lt;/code&gt; is the quantity, &lt;code&gt;tablespoons&lt;/code&gt; is the unit of measure, &lt;code&gt;parsley&lt;/code&gt; is the product, and &lt;code&gt;finely chopped&lt;/code&gt; is a preparation step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After earning &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-1/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom&quot;&gt;a big fat zero&lt;/a&gt; last year, Zestful finally realized significant revenue throughout 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/01/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom&quot;&gt;A single enterprise sale in December&lt;/a&gt; accounted for 79% of its annual revenue. That sale also represented 53% of total revenue across all my businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My efforts to keep Zestful relevant in search results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zestful is in a strange position because companies who parse ingredients &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/shipping-too-late/#the-harsh-reality&quot;&gt;never want to switch to Zestful&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of migrating to a new API outweighs potential price and performance improvements. Instead, all of Zestful's customers are companies building a brand new product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you sell to companies if they don't even exist yet? My strategy has been to invest in search engine optimization so that Zestful ranks highly for queries like “ingredient parsing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $2.3k of revenue, Is It Keto was my second-highest-grossing product for 2019. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/04/&quot;&gt;abandoned the site in April&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/&quot;&gt;came back four months later&lt;/a&gt; after realizing that it had grown by itself without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is It Keto traffic by month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;88% of Is It Keto's visitors come from search engines, but I've never been able to connect improvements in search traffic to any change I made to the site. There were months when I added lots of content, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/#taking-affiliate-revenue-advice-from-reddit&quot;&gt;optimized page titles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/#finally-a-backlink-for-is-it-keto&quot;&gt;earned high-ranking backlinks&lt;/a&gt;, yet traffic remained flat. Other times, I ignored the site for months, and Google traffic grew the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is It Keto was also my biggest expense, as I outsourced much of the writing. That cost me more than it should have because I knew nothing about hiring and managing writers, but the experience taught me a lot and led to my widely ignored &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-writers/&quot;&gt;guide to hiring content writers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pageviews are down substantially, which is unsurprising. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/&quot;&gt;quitting Google post&lt;/a&gt; received 500k pageviews in 2018, so I didn't expect to land another smash hit like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I struggled to find readers last year. Throughout the preceding two years, many of my posts became popular without me trying very hard to promote them. I'd write the article then find an appreciative community to share it with afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I branched out from technical writing and focused more on the struggles of running a bootstrapped business. Even though there are plenty of online communities for bootstrappers, they attract self-promoters, so the groups are less welcoming to off-site blog posts. I've also noticed that readers are less interested in business lessons unless the story involves thousands of dollars — earning or losing large sums both seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog revenue is also down, which is fine because I don't go out of my way to earn money from this blog. My development costs fell dramatically because the site's freelancer shifted focus to his full-time job. Rather than hiring someone else, I've taken over development myself, as my web programming skills have improved over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought What Got Done was a brilliant business idea, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/keep-growing-never-profit/&quot;&gt;months of failing to turn a profit on Is It Keto&lt;/a&gt; left me feeling frustrated. What Got Done seemed like a fun project to cheer me up and an opportunity to teach myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, a popular web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked! I love Vue. I've finally found a tool that lets me build websites quickly without struggling through a maze of leaky abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as I was building What Got Done, I figured that it was worth exploring whether the site could make money. After interviews with several companies, it seemed that managers felt that they could &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/08/#why-use-what-got-done-when-we-have-slack&quot;&gt;accomplish the same results with a dedicated Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;, so I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Bookkeeping&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-$232&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com&quot;&gt;Circle CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-$350&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coveralls.io&quot;&gt;Coveralls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Test coverage tracking&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-$270&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conferences were a hefty expense because travel and lodging are expensive, and the conferences that accepted my speaking proposals were regional events with minimal travel assistance budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching from Travis to Circle for continuous integration reduced my expenses by $68/month, which worked out great because it turned out that I love Circle. They improve their product faster and integrate better with Docker. Coveralls unfortunately auto-renewed without me consciously choosing to do so. I've since accepted that code coverage metrics have little value for early-stage products and canceled for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also switched from managed bookkeeping with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bench.co&quot;&gt;Bench&lt;/a&gt; to self-serve bookkeeping with Xero. I enjoyed Bench and have no love for Xero, but it was hard to justify an extra $1.5k/year for concierge bookkeeping when my finances were so simple and repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;raise-prices-even-if-nobodys-buying&quot;&gt;Raise prices, even if nobody's buying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best pieces of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/07/#suddenly-everyone-wants-to-parse-ingredients&quot;&gt;advice I received&lt;/a&gt; this year was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://coryzue.com&quot;&gt;Cory Zue&lt;/a&gt;. He suggested that at $0.003 per request, my prices for Zestful were too low. At the time, Zestful had almost zero paid users. How could my prices be too low if nobody was buying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Zestful had few real customers, it had many &lt;em&gt;prospective&lt;/em&gt; customers. Every few weeks, a new company contacted me saying that they were interested in Zestful, but it was missing one tiny feature they absolutely needed. Desperate to win my first big client, I'd work feverishly to implement the functionality they wanted. A week later, I'd proudly deliver it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yeah,” they'd reply sheepishly. “That was for a project we decided not to pursue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost these companies nothing to ask for features, but it was extremely time-consuming for me to meet with them and implement their wishlist. I recognized what was happening but couldn't figure out a way to stop it. Ignoring the request was an option, but what if they genuinely were prepared to spend thousands per month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took Cory's advice and raised prices, it changed the conversation in an unexpected way. At $0.003 per request, nobody tried to negotiate with me on price. When my rates jumped by 6.5x to $0.02 per request, everyone started asking about volume discounts. Then, when they claimed they'd buy after Zestful had their pet feature, I gave them this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! You can pre-pay for three months of service, and your billing cycle won't start until that feature is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never been burned on a feature request since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prices are high enough that most customers have to spend a few hundred dollars each month to use Zestful, which discourages people from telling me about the all-important features I'd have to implement to earn their $5/month. Interestingly, the customers who ended up purchasing enterprise plans had no feature requests, and those deals closed in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pursuing-the-right-idea-means-rejecting-the-wrong-ones&quot;&gt;Pursuing the right idea means rejecting the wrong ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first year as a founder, I was a puppy chasing any ball that happened to roll by. If one of my projects failed to achieve traction, I'd work on whatever idea was next in my mental queue. Building a “quick” prototype felt cheap and easy at a project's outset, but it always took weeks of coding and subsequent months of work courting customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jupiterunknown&quot;&gt;David Toth&lt;/a&gt; taught me the value of idea screening. He pointed out that whatever idea I pursue determines large parts of my life for several months at the minimum, so it's worth choosing carefully. Instead of bounding off after the first good idea he has, David generates ideas until he has a list of at least 10. He then evaluates that list carefully to choose which has the highest chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2HZT8lA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start Small, Stay Small&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/start-small-stay-small/&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZshKrl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mom Test&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/the-mom-test/&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;) also influenced how I approach new businesses. Both books encourage founders to start with market research and build the product later. As a result, I was conservative about building anything and gave myself permission to bail if my investigation indicated an idea was no longer my best chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-bigger-swings&quot;&gt;Take bigger swings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set last year's goal to $500/month in revenue, people encouraged me to set a higher target. New businesses have a high chance of failure, so I may as well shoot for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I still feel that $500/month was sensible. Is It Keto was a nice “beginner business” because the mechanics were so simple. Ads and affiliate purchases generated about $0.01 per visitor, on average. More visits meant more money, so I got to experiment with different growth strategies without worrying about things like pricing, sales funnels, or customer support. It was gratifying to watch my revenues begin at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/isitketo-month-4-my-first-dollar-of-revenue-03e572f661&quot;&gt;paltry $1/month&lt;/a&gt; and then grow by 50-150% each month to reach $400/month by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flip side was seeing the limitations of low-margin businesses. When revenues are a penny per customer, most avenues for expansion are off the table. It makes no sense to pay $0.50-$1.50 per click for an ad if the visitor only generates $0.01 in revenue. I'd love to bring on an employee to help grow the site, but even a cheap $200/month freelancer would have to double my traffic to justify their cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm entering my third year as a founder, I'm ready to make bigger bets. Growing Is It Keto gave me the confidence to push myself more. That means taking on projects where success would afford me a couple of part-time contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-still-love-it&quot;&gt;I still love it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people find out that I've run at a financial loss for the past two years, they worry that I regret leaving my cushy Google job. It's common for founders to experience burnout after a year or two, but I've been fortunate never to feel that way. I chalk this up to my healthy sense of self-doubt at the start of this adventure — I expected to fail awhile before finding success. It's also easy to avoid financial stress when you're in no danger of running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I come downstairs and enjoy a leisurely breakfast with my girlfriend. We live at the end of a dead-end street, so when she leaves for work, my house is perfectly quiet. After writing for 60-90 minutes, I map out the rest of my day. I don't work after dinner or on the weekends. If I feel sleepy at 3pm, I take a nap and never worry about what my manager thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before quitting, the part of the lifestyle I fantasized about most was the pure independence of it. It is indeed as satisfying as I dreamed. I love having full autonomy over my day and the freedom to completely change the direction of my businesses or start over when it feels right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd do this forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;grading-my-goals&quot;&gt;Grading my goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last year's update, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-1/#goals-for-year-two&quot;&gt;gave myself four goals&lt;/a&gt; for the year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;achieve-500month-in-revenue-across-my-businesses&quot;&gt;Achieve $500/month in revenue across my businesses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: B+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hit this goal in that my revenue was $604/month for the year and $1,657/month for Q4, though it feels like cheating to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/01/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom&quot;&gt;my huge outlier sale&lt;/a&gt; from December. Without it, I'd be at $441 in total revenue for December, which is closer to what the likely trend will be through early 2020. It's not quite $500, but it's satisfyingly close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;present-talks-at-three-software-conferences&quot;&gt;Present talks at three software conferences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three conferences accepted my speaking proposals, and I'm proud of my presentations at all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy conferences and pick up useful information by attending, but if I'm being honest, they don't materially improve my professional or personal life. Between travel, preparing my talks, and attending the event itself, I spent six to eight weeks of full-time work on conference presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue applying to and attending conferences in 2020, but I'll be more selective than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publish-12-blog-posts&quot;&gt;Publish 12 blog posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how you count, I either published 9 or 13 blog posts in 2019. There were nine separate updates to my blog, but one of them was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-writers/&quot;&gt;a five-part series on hiring content writers&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, I'm pleased with my writing for the year, though I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/#mtlynchio-this-blog&quot;&gt;wish more of my posts had gained traction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gain-comfort-with-a-javascript-framework&quot;&gt;Gain comfort with a JavaScript framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade&lt;/strong&gt;: A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a Vue expert, but I'd describe myself as “conversational.” I can build sites quickly without getting stuck on the framework itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of banging my head against the wall with &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, I'm delighted to have found a framework that feels appropriate for solo developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project that I hope to focus on for a large portion of the coming year is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderjest.com&quot;&gt;WanderJest&lt;/a&gt;, a website I created a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-border&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 768px) 600px, 98vw&quot; srcset=&quot; /solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020_hu45e81b12bd9b1b3f2792aba9c0cf02db_131267_300x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 300w, /solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020_hu45e81b12bd9b1b3f2792aba9c0cf02db_131267_600x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 600w, /solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020_hu45e81b12bd9b1b3f2792aba9c0cf02db_131267_800x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 800w, /solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020_hu45e81b12bd9b1b3f2792aba9c0cf02db_131267_1200x0_resize_q90_lanczos.jpg 1200w, /solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020.jpg 1306w&quot; src=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/wanderjest-feb-2020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of WanderJest website&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderjest.com&quot;&gt;WanderJest&lt;/a&gt; is a resource for finding live comedy shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to find local comedy shows, as listings are scattered amongst Facebook groups, comedy club websites, and ticket sellers like TicketMaster and Eventbrite. My hope is for WanderJest to unify these disparate sources, making it easier for audiences to find shows. Basically, the idea is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bandsintown.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bandsintown&lt;/a&gt;, but for comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm piloting it in my home area of Western Massachusetts, but I'll soon expand it to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-year-three&quot;&gt;Goals for year three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I hope to accomplish in my third year as a solo developer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earn $20,000 in revenue across my businesses.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tripled revenues in 2019, so $20k means tripling again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish 10 blog posts.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This gives me time for about one article per month with enough slack for longer posts and time off to prepare a conference presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn one new technology.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning a totally new language or framework tends to improve my overall thinking about software, and I've been looking for an excuse to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>My Second Year as a Solo Developer</og:title>
<og:description>Two years ago, I quit my developer job at Google to build my own software business. A year later, I posted an update about my finances, happiness, and lessons learned. Today marks the end of my second full year, so it's time for another update.</og:description>
