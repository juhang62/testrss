<title>Daydreaming about the future instead of doing work today</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Future You Masturbation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://howitactuallyworks.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How It Actually Works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who’s creating an awesome side project: LED signs that you can control to let your coworkers know you’re busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/green-wired-in-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a bunch of fun features that he considers important to the type of business he “wants” to build in the future: integrating with Slack &amp;amp; other online tools, different colors, sync with a Mac &amp;amp; iPhone app, and too much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that even though he gets orders with zero marketing he’s still hand assembling the signs himself at his kitchen table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the priority? Writing software for future use cases, or finding an assembler to build the signs for him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presented like this you, dear reader, will think the choice is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to that I say: you make the same mistake every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where he gets stuck - where we all get stuck - is doing Future You Masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Vision with all the bells &amp;amp; whistles is fun to think about because it gives you all the benefits with none of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can picture how you’ll look and feel, the money in your bank account, the respect of your friends and peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At no cost you get to imagine a perfect future that has everything you want &amp;amp; nothing you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all the bad stuff, all the unexpected twists &amp;amp; turns, the late nights &amp;amp; early mornings, the rejections &amp;amp; betrayals… even if you wanted to you couldn’t imagine them &lt;strong&gt;because you don’t yet know what they’re going to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future You Masturbation gives you the pleasure of all your future accomplishments with none of the work. It’s your brain tricking you into something that feels good today in exchange for lost meaning and purpose and accomplishment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Do The Work&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New projects are like being dropped in the middle of nowhere with 100 different paths in front of you. You have no clue where any of them will lead &amp;amp; can only see the first 3 steps in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t choose at all &amp;amp; instead do more “research” and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue the metaphor: instead of choosing one of the 100 paths and beginning to walk we start building a tower that we believe will let us see higher to help us choose the “best” path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we don’t know whether the extra vision from the tower will give us more useful information than walking a few steps down one of the paths, but we do it anyway because because it feels safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get to keep all the optionality and the Big Vision can’t be messed with. And the entire time you’re building your tower of research you’re Future You Masturbating so it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like you’re making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should all do is pick the path that has the best 3 feet. In my friend’s case: follow the money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People want the signs so find the cheapest and most reliable way to make them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That requires going outside his expertise though. And, more importantly, it might not work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path he chooses might be a dead end and will likely have more bumps than other paths he could have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wants to work on something that might not even work out? Yet another reason to daydream about the future instead of doing work today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably point at my friend &amp;amp; think “yeah but that’s so obvious you do the thing in front of you first”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OH REALLY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;been inspired to get in shape and instead of immediately running gone online to shop for workout clothes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a business by making a website instead of finding a customer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complained about your dating prospects instead of making yourself more dateable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailed someone where a call would be better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting goal setting by buying a fancy journal instead of opening a Google Doc ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put off the correct, hard work for the easier, less effective work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was originally published in my weekly newsletter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://howitactuallyworks.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How It Actually Works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Meaning Without Success&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard work is the direction we need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will it get us closer to the goals but it will add meaning to our lives even if we never accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have a Tesla in your brain or a Tesla in real life doesn’t make a difference in how happy you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambus.net/oldest-domains-in-the-com-net-and-org-tlds/&quot;&gt;The Earliest Registered .com Domain Names&lt;/a&gt; (cambus.net, article)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what it says. Skip to the bottom for the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly effective advice for such a cliché topic. I like #4.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India Imposes Complete Ban on Solid Plastic Waste Imports</title>
<link>https://thewire.in/environment/india-solid-plastic-import-banned</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thewire.in/environment/india-solid-plastic-import-banned</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; A loophole that was apparently responsible for India’s imports of solid plastic waste quadrupling in the last fiscal year (FY) has been closed after the government amended the rules. Though solid plastic waste imports were banned in 2015, the Centre allowed agencies in special economic zones (SEZ) to import them in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to reports, the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 was amended to the effect that units in SEZs or export oriented units were also banned from importing solid plastic ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, it was reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/environment/plastic-import-india-pet-bottles-ban-increase&quot;&gt;India’s plastic imports had increased from 12,000 tonnes in 2016-17 FY to 48,000 in the 2017-18 FY&lt;/a&gt;. While India has recycles a higher percentage of its plastic waste than most countries, 44% of its plastic waste is still not recycled. The rising imports only made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/pollution/india-bans-import-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/68293186.cms&quot;&gt;The environment ministry&lt;/a&gt; admitted as much, when the “huge gap between waste generation and recycling capacity” in the country was attributed as one reason for the complete ban. Officials said India’s “commitment to completely phase out single-use plastic by 2022” was another reason for the new amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased imports of solid plastic waste to India was a result of China’s complete ban on importing such waste. China was the largest importer previously and the vacuum left by it was occupied by countries such as Malaysia and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/environment/plastic-import-india-pet-bottles-ban-increase&quot;&gt;How Are India’s Plastic Waste Imports Increasing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pib.nic.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1567682&quot;&gt;amendments announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; also exempted exporters of silk from requiring permission from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Electrical and electronic assemblies and components manufactured in and exported from India, if found defective can now be imported back into the country, within a year of export, without obtaining permission from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change,” the ministry said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, industries that do not require consent under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 were exempted from requiring authorisation also under the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management &amp;amp; Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. This exemption would be on the condition that hazardous and other wastes generated by the industries are handed over to the authorised actual users, waste collectors or disposal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e210&quot; id=&quot;e210&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;California is hard to beat. There are richer places with worse weather, there are (a few) nicer climates with worse economies, but it’s really hard to find any place on planet earth that’s nicer to live in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to work in. There’s a consensus among smart people that the Bay Area is the place to be, and they relocate accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d58&quot; id=&quot;9d58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Smart people are generally right on average. But whenever the consensus among smart people is that you can make a given decision without thinking too hard, beware: the flip side of intelligence is the ability to rationalize bad decisions rather than admit your mistakes. It took a lot of intellectual horsepower to rationalize Superbowl ads and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;free shipping for cat litter&lt;/a&gt; in 2000; it took a similar amount of braininess to believe that subprime mortgages could be aggregated into securities that were as safe as treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b3f1&quot; id=&quot;b3f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are three related problems that make California economically tenuous, and a fourth that makes the situation worse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a959&quot; id=&quot;a959&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s no longer the best place in the world to start a startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1373&quot; id=&quot;1373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The gains from the existing tech industry increasingly accrue to a) passive investors, and b) lucky landlords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;de5c&quot; id=&quot;de5c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The state government is a levered bet on tech compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e0bb&quot; id=&quot;e0bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;These three problems, which are interrelated, won’t show visible symptoms until well after they’re terminally un-fixable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VzpfniCc8S1ygMj2Z8CaUA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;960&quot; data-height=&quot;472&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*VzpfniCc8S1ygMj2Z8CaUA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VzpfniCc8S1ygMj2Z8CaUA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here in New York we prize elegant design and high production values.
&lt;p name=&quot;9385&quot; id=&quot;9385&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The good news, such as it is: part of my bear case on the Bear Republic is that its most valuable assets can just pick up and leave, so it’s not a bad place to be right now. If you get a nice offer from a big tech company, by all means, go to Mountain View or Los Gatos or even San Francisco. (If you can afford Pacific Heights rents and ride-sharing everywhere, you can pretend you don’t live in SF at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e33f&quot; id=&quot;e33f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But if you’re considering starting a company, maybe take a look at Austin, Brooklyn, Denver, or Seattle.[1] All of these places have some of the same problems as California, but at a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0f1f&quot; id=&quot;0f1f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The California Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;434d&quot; id=&quot;434d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Since the late 1970s, California has benefited from a virtuous cycle that goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a4ec&quot; id=&quot;a4ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A group of smart people decide to solve a challenging technical and business problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;86e1&quot; id=&quot;86e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;They raise some money, form a company, and dole out stock options to early employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;597b&quot; id=&quot;597b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The company grows, and either sells or goes public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5bab&quot; id=&quot;5bab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The founders retire, get bored after a couple days, and return to step two, except this time they’re the ones writing checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;6b4a&quot; id=&quot;6b4a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Every generation of technology has been disproportionately funded by the founders of companies in the previous generation. Kleiner and Perkins of Kleiner Perkins were early employees at Fairchild and Hewlett-Packard. Fairchild and Intel begot Mike Markkula, who retired from his options at 32 and then un-retired after he met Jobs and Wozniak. Sun Microsystems begat Khosla Ventures and Andy Bechtolsheim, an angel investor so aggressive he once wrote a check to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim#Investments&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim#Investments&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a company that didn’t exist yet&lt;/a&gt;. (It worked out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9579&quot; id=&quot;9579&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For this cycle to work, your ecosystem needs three things: big companies that can buy out small companies and produce a cash windfall; rich people who are still hungry to get richer but don’t want to be CEOs any more; and new companies that can survive long enough to raise funding in order to join the other two categories. The cycle further benefits from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/alchian-allen-and-agglomeration-explaining-economic-inequality-and-nice-golf-courses-in-vegas-379eae5ddc5&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/alchian-allen-and-agglomeration-explaining-economic-inequality-and-nice-golf-courses-in-vegas-379eae5ddc5&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alchian-Allen effect&lt;/a&gt;: agglomerating industries have higher productivity, which raises the cost of living and prices out other industries, raising concentration over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0eb9&quot; id=&quot;0eb9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;New, small companies are the most fragile and least visible part of this ecosystem. They’re hard to see because the best companies keep a low profile (a CEO with time to cultivate an image is not a CEO busy writing code or talking to customers), and because reporters are always willing to talk about a company filling the role of Hot New Startup. When Genentech is a startup, they’ll write about Genentech; when there aren’t any new Genentechs, they’ll write about Theranos instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3be6&quot; id=&quot;3be6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;New companies are essential because whenever there’s a new technology or a new way of organizing a business, it’s unclear whether the result will be a bigger industry or a smaller one. When Uber first came out, you could debate whether it would 10x the size of the car-hire market, or just reduce ROI to below the cost of capital by creating an unlimited supply of drivers. (You can still have this debate, but it’s harder to deny the upside opportunity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;62fa&quot; id=&quot;62fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since startups raise the variance within whatever industry they’re started in, the natural constituency for them is someone who doesn’t have capital deployed in the industry. If you’re an asset owner, you want low volatility. Since a startup is a call option on whatever business it will turn into, it benefits from higher volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c508&quot; id=&quot;c508&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Historically, startups have created a constant supply of volatility for tech companies; the next generation is always cannibalizing the previous one. So chip companies in the 1970s created the PC companies of the 80s, but PC companies sourced cheaper and cheaper chips, commoditizing the product until Intel managed to fight back. Meanwhile, the OS turned PCs into a commodity, then search engines and social media turned the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/em&gt; into a commodity, and presumably this process will continue indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a8b&quot; id=&quot;6a8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What that looks like from a financial markets perspective is that tech companies go through a golden age where they’re growing fast and trading at a sky-high multiple, then suddenly they’re trading at a below-market multiple because their revenue growth is flat at best and unstable at worst. What’s worrisome is that, if we have fewer startups, this valuation compression will start to happen later, or not at all. If you’re just looking at public markets, all you’ll see is that the numbers have never been better, and if you’re looking at private markets, you’ll see that the bubble you were worried about has gotten less frothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2726&quot; id=&quot;2726&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Land and Burn Rates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03ce&quot; id=&quot;03ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The key reason that startups are getting harder to start in California is that the incremental cost of existing and growing has gotten higher. There are two monopolists to blame: landlords, and platform companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57ec&quot; id=&quot;57ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Landlords are the most annoying. A California landlord is generally not much more skilled or talented than other landlords; they just happened to own property in a place with a high concentration of engineers (thanks to good schools) and hippies (thanks to those schools’ liberal arts programs, as well as the fact that you can sleep outdoors in SF year-round). The engineers ensure that there’s growing demand for property; the hippies conspire with landlords to limit supply. Perhaps the funniest case study was that it took four months for San Francisco to determine that &lt;a href=&quot;https://sf.curbed.com/2018/6/11/17451078/historic-mission-laundromat-2918-mission-review&quot; data-href=&quot;https://sf.curbed.com/2018/6/11/17451078/historic-mission-laundromat-2918-mission-review&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a laundromat&lt;/a&gt; was not an historic site that the city could not allow to be demolished.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d394&quot; id=&quot;d394&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve lived in the Midwest, on the Texas/Mexico border, and in New York, and when I moved to San Francisco I was surprised to see that anti-immigrant sentiment was quite socially-acceptable there. Literally, on my way to work, I’d see propaganda posters about how people like me who’d moved to San Francisco had better pack up and leave — or else. I can understand some level of discomfort with changes in one’s community brought about by immigration, whether it’s smart people from foreign countries or just people from other cities. But the policies SF has chosen are just plain pathological: the city reduces the supply of housing to discourage gentrifiers from moving in, so gentrifiers bid against natives. The rising cost-of-living prices more industries out, making tech companies more dominant, and the rising share of tech company residents means that tech comp increasingly sets the market price for housing. If San Francisco wants to eliminate gentrification, they’re going to have to accept becoming very poor. If they want to mitigate the impact of gentrification, they should start building some big &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_Town%E2%80%93Peter_Cooper_Village&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_Town%E2%80%93Peter_Cooper_Village&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stuy Town&lt;/a&gt;-style high-density apartment blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;74fe&quot; id=&quot;74fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Real estate supply restrictions have a perverse effect. Per the law of supply and demand, they mean that demand is immediately and indefinitely reflected in price. Since demand is set by the incomes of people who think they’ll be earning that amount of money for the next year, the cash flow characteristics of a city’s businesses determine what effect high real estate prices have. In New York, finance and law start paying you well right away. It’s rare for a startup financial company to produce negative cash flow for owners after the first year. Other industries in New York have worse immediate cash flow prospects — media, fashion, and music, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;80b2&quot; id=&quot;80b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For a city to have a thriving arts scene, you need some combination of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;09b9&quot; id=&quot;09b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Families or nightlife, both of which produce demand for reasonably educated workers who work non-traditional or variable-schedule jobs, either as babysitters or bartenders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d46c&quot; id=&quot;d46c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Cheap neighborhoods that aren’t unsafe. My current neighborhood, Williamsburg, fit this role ten years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4a41&quot; id=&quot;4a41&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Upside, either in the form of selling out or marrying someone with a boring but lucrative job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;c0a7&quot; id=&quot;c0a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;New York manages to combine all of these in clever ways. For example, the New York restaurant industry benefits from two dinner shifts, because finance and media/fashion are basically in two different time zones. Traders leave work at 5 and have expense-account dinners at 5:30; by the time the table’s cleared at 8 it’s time for the ad agency and fashion people to show up for &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; expense-account dinner. New York’s nightlife feeds into family formation, maintaining a balance between demand for babysitters and bartenders, while also keeping wages up by reducing the supply.[3] And in a broader sense, status in New York is a progressive tax on wealth because the city is full of opportunities for conspicuous consumption. You can earn below the poverty line and save money, at least if you’re healthy and able-bodied; but as Tom Wolfe pointed out back in the 80s, you can also slowly go broke earning a million dollars a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;27e7&quot; id=&quot;27e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Startups are not like New York’s low-paying jobs; there is a “marriage” market, in the sense that one exit opportunity is to meet a Corp Dev matchmaker and decide where you want to settle down. But that takes a while, and unlike in New York, the economically disadvantaged party is the one paying for the dates, at least in terms of opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef23&quot; id=&quot;ef23&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s anecdotal evidence of this. When Airbnb was just starting out, the founders spent years being nearly broke. It’s hard to imagine someone living in the Bay Area spending a long time “nearly broke” today; they’d spend too much on rent and have to move back home or get a BigCo job. Y Combinator has implicitly acknowledged this. When the program started in 2005, they’d offer founders a maximum of $20,000 to spend the summer running a startup. Now it’s $120,000. That’s a 14% compounded growth rate in the minimum amount of cash on hand needed to start a company. YC has also grown, but it’s hard to count on one organization to hold back the tide here. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;As long as higher rents raise the cost of starting a pre-revenue company, fewer people will join them, so more people will join established companies, where they’ll earn market salaries and continue to push up rents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7387&quot; id=&quot;7387&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And one of the things they’ll do there is optimize ad loads, which places another tax on startups. More dangerously, this is an incremental tax on growth rather than a fixed tax on headcount, so it puts pressure on out-year valuations, not just upfront cash flow. According to Social Capital’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/socialcapital-annual-letters/Social+Capital+Interim+Annual+Letter,+2018.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/socialcapital-annual-letters/Social+Capital+Interim+Annual+Letter,+2018.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 letter&lt;/a&gt;, almost 40% of VC money goes to advertising on the largest search, social, and e-commerce channels. Those channels have adapted to a world where they’re the best place to scale because they have the biggest audience, which means there’s more money for them in optimizing their revenue capture. Thus, ads get better-targeted, ad loads rise over time, more content moves into the walled garden, and it becomes progressively harder not to pay an economically efficient (read: very high) ad price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1af2&quot; id=&quot;1af2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Digital landlords at least homesteaded their land and made it worth renting on. Unfortunately, they’re a lot better at charging the Laffer optimal tax rate on their tenants’ profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d9a3&quot; id=&quot;d9a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Public Pension Funds: A Slow-Motion Run on the Bank&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3640&quot; id=&quot;3640&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;You may notice that my thesis is about “California,” but my comments have been restricted to the Bay Area. There’s a reason for this: the Bay has provided vast income and capital gains tax upside for California in the last few decades, which the state has habitually spent as quickly as it can. Government spending tends to be sticky, especially because one of the easiest ways for governments to give away money is to get higher cash flow today in exchange for taking on higher future liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;384c&quot; id=&quot;384c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The final piece of the California puzzle — after the real estate tax on low-cash flow startups and the platform tax on growth-stage startups — is the literal taxes on everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;131b&quot; id=&quot;131b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are two key points to understand about California’s fiscal situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e1c2&quot; id=&quot;e1c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Income taxes, which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2018/3805/ca-tax-system-041218.pdf#page=12&quot; data-href=&quot;https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2018/3805/ca-tax-system-041218.pdf#page=12&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;volatile&lt;/a&gt;, are a large proportion of state revenue. And capital gains taxes are in the high-single digits. Since capital gains are the integral of income over time (they’re a change in the market’s estimation of the net present value of all future income from a company), they’re particularly cyclical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0df5&quot; id=&quot;0df5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;California’s public pensions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hoover.org/research/californias-pension-indigestion-appetite-fine-dining-while-stuck-fast-food-budget&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.hoover.org/research/californias-pension-indigestion-appetite-fine-dining-while-stuck-fast-food-budget&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;massively underfunded&lt;/a&gt; (the $769bn in that article is an overestimate, but it’s directionally right).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;fc25&quot; id=&quot;fc25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Now, consider the incentives for someone living in California during a recession. Budgets are getting cut, but state worker headcount and compensation are sticky due to heavy unionization, so the net result is that there’s a reduction in new services offered. At best, this means the state government is stuck solving whatever problems were most pressing back when their budget was growing; at worst, it means that the state is just a jobs program. While there’s pressure to lay off employees, there’s heightened pressure from those employees not to do so — the stability of a government job is particularly desirable when unemployment is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;20ce&quot; id=&quot;20ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So something has to give: taxes have to rise. As taxes go up, people start to consider living elsewhere. (We already see this with people who run mature companies; they like to retire to Florida or something for a year before they close a sale, so they avoid the capital gains tax.) Every time the tax base diminishes, the tax burden on the people who stay behind goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ee3&quot; id=&quot;5ee3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Big companies won’t leave right away. The network effects of the Bay are too strong. They may grow other offices, and employees will transfer, but the Stanford/Berkeley/Caltech-to-Big Tech Company pipeline will persist. However, the current crop of big companies will still be the big tech companies in 2030 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4214&quot; id=&quot;4214&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Over the long term, California’s future looks like New York excluding New York City, albeit with nicer weather. There will be big companies that slowly decline, the tax base will deplete, and politicians will have to find ways to raise taxes on the remaining citizens while getting them to tolerate the same or diminished levels of government services.[4] Eventually, this will reduce the price of housing, but not in a way that revitalizes startups. Instead, we’ll have a dynamic where a house that used to be 50% too expensive at a million dollars will still be 50% too expensive at $750,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4e18&quot; id=&quot;4e18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5120&quot; id=&quot;5120&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Once upon a time, California was cheap. In the 50s and 60s, it was a place where you could work part-time to fund your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008IU9IVG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008IU9IVG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;biker gang&lt;/a&gt;. In the 70s, you could work part-time to fund your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LFZ84PC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LFZ84PC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revolutionary terrorist cell&lt;/a&gt;. Such side projects are infeasible today. If you’re going to run a massive bombing campaign out of a house in San Francisco, you’ll need to raise at least a mid-six figure seed round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f64&quot; id=&quot;8f64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You can see the decline over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;c783&quot; id=&quot;c783&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Semiconductor startups, which are capital-intensive once they start manufacturing, were mostly founded by people leaving other hardware companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;eb73&quot; id=&quot;eb73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;PC companies got founded in garages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;298c&quot; id=&quot;298c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The biggest of the Internet companies got founded in garages and trailers, yes — by procrastinating grad students who had stipends and university-provided computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6634&quot; id=&quot;6634&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Mid-2000s consumer web companies economized on labor by hiring friends, and raised small seed rounds. When Y Combinator started, funding was explicitly modeled on grad student stipends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;91e2&quot; id=&quot;91e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Today, YC thinks it takes $150k to fund a startup through Demo Day and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;d2f1&quot; id=&quot;d2f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;As the market for talent gets more efficient and the supply of housing remains constrained, the required burn rate for startups will rise, making them an increasingly expensive indulgence. Rewind the Airbnb story but with higher rents and it’s a story about three guys who ran a novelty website for a while before they all got jobs designing marketing microsites for Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;feb4&quot; id=&quot;feb4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;California’s politicians will always be able to say “We’re so happy to be the home of companies like X, Y, and Z.” It will take them a long, long time to notice that “X, Y, and Z” used to change every five years, then it was every ten, then it was the same companies for a generation. By the time they figure out that the big new companies aren’t being founded nearby, the next big startup cluster will already have had its first round of exits, and Austin or Portland or Raleigh will be full of angel investors and small VC shops itching to perpetuate the local startup cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd55&quot; id=&quot;fd55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Californians will end up like the landed gentry in interwar England. Lovely houses, illustrious history, and no conceivable way to pay their bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce2c&quot; id=&quot;ce2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Don’t miss the next story.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ebcca019646af0aef311450c7&amp;amp;id=074da9dcef&quot; data-href=&quot;https://us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ebcca019646af0aef311450c7&amp;amp;id=074da9dcef&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for my occasional email newsletter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Winding down my Debian involvement</title>

<description>&lt;details&gt;Table of contents
&lt;nav id=&quot;TableOfContents&quot;/&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly, that last one might be a Swiss thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks, I will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove myself from the &lt;code&gt;Uploaders&lt;/code&gt; field on packages with other maintainers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://manpages.debian.org/&quot;&gt;manpages.debian.org&lt;/a&gt; service and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesearch.debian.net/&quot;&gt;codesearch.debian.net&lt;/a&gt; service, but any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the little spare time that I have these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more easily machine readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;change-process-in-debian&quot;&gt;Change process in Debian&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points do actually apply to Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/&quot;&gt;Debian Policy&lt;/a&gt;, or its programmatic embodiment, lintian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change (e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be able to do their work transparent to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the &lt;strong&gt;cost of each change&lt;/strong&gt; is distributed onto the package maintainers in the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is &lt;strong&gt;lacking tooling for large changes&lt;/strong&gt;: it is hard to programmatically deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to “sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too complicated and started &lt;a href=&quot;https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/&quot;&gt;mergebot&lt;/a&gt;, but only Guido ever signaled interest in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!) is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years, which is a huge demotivator for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s merits 10 years after I first heard about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which in turn makes tooling harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would things look like in a better world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving individual maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI&quot;&gt;my colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Fragmented workflow and infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories (as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly from team to team, and even within teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request, you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests, email, …).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf 13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I started), I tried fixing this with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html&quot;&gt;workflow changes proposal&lt;/a&gt;, but did not succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and energy killed any motivation I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;old-infrastructure-package-uploads&quot;&gt;Old infrastructure: package uploads&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, &lt;code&gt;unchecked&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dinstall&lt;/code&gt;, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. &lt;code&gt;dinstall&lt;/code&gt; runs at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!) before your package is actually installable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I can spend on Debian per day is measured in minutes, this makes a huge difference in perceived productivity and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last communication I can find about speeding up this process is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00014.html&quot;&gt;ganneff’s post&lt;/a&gt; from 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would things look like in a better world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anonymous FTP would be replaced by a web service which ingests my package and returns an authoritative accept or reject decision in its response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For accepted packages, there would be a status page displaying the build status and when the package will be available via the mirror network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages should be available within a few minutes after the build completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;old-infrastructure-bug-tracker&quot;&gt;Old infrastructure: bug tracker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dread interacting with the Debian bug tracker. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbugs&quot;&gt;debbugs&lt;/a&gt; is a piece of software (from 1994) which is only used by Debian and the GNU project these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbugs processes emails, which is to say it is asynchronous and cumbersome to deal with. Despite running on the fastest machines we have available in Debian (or so I was told when the subject last came up), its web interface loads very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the web interface at bugs.debian.org is read-only. Setting up a working email setup for &lt;a href=&quot;https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/reportbug/reportbug.1.en.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reportbug(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or manually dealing with attachments is a rather big hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons I don’t understand, every interaction with debbugs results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zekjur/status/1027995569770442752&quot;&gt;many different email &lt;em&gt;threads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the technical implementation, I also can never remember the different ways that Debian uses pseudo-packages for bugs and processes. I need them rarely enough to establish a mental model of how they are set up, or working memory of how they are used, but frequently enough to be annoyed by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would things look like in a better world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debian would switch from a custom bug tracker to a (any) well-established one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debian would offer automation around processes. It is great to have a paper-trail and artifacts of the process in the form of a bug report, but the primary interface should be more convenient (e.g. a web form).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;old-infrastructure-mailing-list-archives&quot;&gt;Old infrastructure: mailing list archives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It baffles me that in 2019, we still don’t have a conveniently browsable threaded archive of mailing list discussions. Email and threading is more widely used in Debian than anywhere else, so this is somewhat ironic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmane&quot;&gt;Gmane&lt;/a&gt; used to paper over this issue, but Gmane’s availability over the last few years has been spotty, to say the least (it is down as I write this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to contribute a threaded list archive, but our listmasters didn’t seem to care or want to support the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;debian-is-hard-to-machine-read&quot;&gt;Debian is hard to machine-read&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is obviously possible to deal with Debian packages programmatically, the experience is far from pleasant. Everything seems slow and cumbersome. I have picked just 3 quick examples to illustrate my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Debian/debiman/&quot;&gt;debiman&lt;/a&gt; needs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Debian/debiman/issues/12&quot;&gt;help from piuparts&lt;/a&gt; in analyzing the alternatives mechanism of each package to display the manpages of e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/postgresql-client-9.6/psql.1.en.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;psql(1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is because maintainer scripts modify the alternatives database by calling shell scripts. Without actually installing a package, you cannot know which changes it does to the alternatives database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Debian/pk4&quot;&gt;pk4&lt;/a&gt; needs to maintain its own cache to look up package metadata based on the package name. Other tools parse the apt database from scratch on every invocation. A proper database format, or at least a binary interchange format, would go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Debian/dcs/&quot;&gt;Debian Code Search&lt;/a&gt; wants to ingest new packages as quickly as possible. There used to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedmsg&quot;&gt;fedmsg&lt;/a&gt; instance for Debian, but it no longer seems to exist. It is unclear where to get notifications from for new packages, and where best to fetch those packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;complicated-build-stack&quot;&gt;Complicated build stack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&quot;https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-11-25-build-tools/&quot;&gt;“Debian package build tools”&lt;/a&gt; post. It really bugs me that the sprawl of tools is not seen as a problem by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;developer-experience-pretty-painful&quot;&gt;Developer experience pretty painful&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the points discussed so far deal with the experience in &lt;em&gt;developing Debian&lt;/em&gt;, but as I recently described in my post &lt;a href=&quot;https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2019-02-15-debian-debugging-devex/&quot;&gt;“Debugging experience in Debian”&lt;/a&gt;, the experience when &lt;em&gt;developing using Debian&lt;/em&gt; leaves a lot to be desired, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-have-more-ideas&quot;&gt;I have more ideas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the article is getting pretty long, and hopefully you got a rough idea of my motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I described a number of specific shortcomings above, the final nail in the coffin is actually the lack of a positive outlook. I have more ideas that seem really compelling to me, but, based on how my previous projects have been going, I don’t think I can make any of these ideas happen within the Debian project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to publish a few more posts about specific ideas for improving operating systems here. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I hope this post inspires someone, ideally a group of people, to improve the developer experience within Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thousands of Russians protest against internet restrictions</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow and two other cities on Sunday to rally against tighter internet restrictions, in some of the biggest protests in the Russian capital in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People shout slogans during a rally to protest against tightening state control over internet in Moscow, Russia March 10, 2019. REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers last month backed tighter internet controls contained in legislation they say is necessary to prevent foreign meddling in Russia’s affairs. But some Russian media likened it to an online “iron curtain” and critics say it can be used to stifle dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People gathered in a cordoned off Prospekt Sakharova street in Moscow, made speeches on a stage and chanted slogans such as “hands off the internet” and “no to isolation, stop breaking the Russian internet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally gathered around 15,300 people, according to White Counter, an NGO that counts participants at rallies. Moscow police put the numbers at 6,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we do nothing it will get worse. The authorities will keep following their own way and the point of no return will be passed”, said 28-year-old protester Dmitry, who declined to give his full name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition activists said on Twitter that police had detained 15 people at the Moscow rally, confiscating their banners and balloons. Police have not announced any detentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protests in Moscow, the southern city of Voronezh and Khabarovsk in the far east had all been officially authorized. A handful of activists in St. Petersburg took to the streets without the authorities’ consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has in recent years attempted to curb internet freedoms by blocking access to certain websites and messaging services such as Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February’s bill passed in the Russian parliament on the first reading out of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seeks to route Russian web traffic and data through points controlled by the state and proposes building a national Domain Name System to allow the internet to continue functioning even if the country is cut off from foreign infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reading is planned in March after which, if passed, the bill will need to be signed by the upper house of the parliament and then by President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation is part of a drive by officials to increase Russian “sovereignty” over its Internet segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has introduced tougher internet laws in recent years, requiring search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services and social networks to store Russian users’ personal data on servers within the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Goodbye Docker and Thanks for all the Fish</title>
<link>https://technodrone.blogspot.com/2019/02/goodbye-docker-and-thanks-for-all-fish.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://technodrone.blogspot.com/2019/02/goodbye-docker-and-thanks-for-all-fish.html</guid>
<description>Back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maishsk/status/1019115484673970176&quot;&gt;July 2018&lt;/a&gt;, I started to write a blog post about the upcoming death of Docker as a company (and also perhaps as a technology) but I never got round to completing and publishing the post. It is time to actually get that post out.&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;OK .. Time to share my thoughts on the soon to be death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/docker?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The reason I chose this title for the blogpost is because, in my humble opinion the days for Docker as a company are numbered and maybe also a technology as well. If would indulge me with a few minutes of your time - I will share with you the basis for my thoughts.&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago - Docker was the company that changed the world - and we can safely say - is still changing the world today. Containers and the technology behind containers has been around for many years, long before the word docker was even thought of, even turned into a verb (“Dockerize all the things”), but Docker was the company that enabled the masses to consume the technology of containers, in a easy and simple fashion. Most technology companies (or at least companies that consider themselves to be a modern tech company) will be using Docker or containers as part of their product or their pipeline - because it makes so much sense and brings so much benefit to whole process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12-24 months, people are coming to the realization that docker has run its course and as a technology is not going to be able to provide additional value to what they have today - and have decided to start to look elsewhere for that extra edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has won the container orchestration war, I don’t think that anyone can deny that fact. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/kubernetes-wins-docker-acquiesces-adopts-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;Docker itself has adopted Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;. There will always be niche players that have specific use cases for Docker Swarm, Mesos, Marathon, Nomad - but the de-facto standard is Kubernetes. All 3 big cloud providers, now have a managed Kubernetes solution that they offer to their customers (and as a result will &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-container-service-will-retire-on-january-31-2020/&quot;&gt;eventually sunset&lt;/a&gt; their own home-made solutions that they built over the years - because there can be only one). Everyone is building more services and providing more solutions, to bring in more customers, increase their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story is done. Nothing to see here. Next shiny thing please..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Kubernetes uses docker as the underlying container engine. I think that the Kubernetes community understood that Docker as a container runtime (and I use this term specifically) was the ultimate solution to get a product out of the gate as soon as possible. They also (wisely) understood quite early on they needed to have the option of switching out that container runtime - and allowing the consumers of Kubernetes to make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencontainers.org/&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; - brought with it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec&quot;&gt;Runtime Spec&lt;/a&gt; - which opened the door to allow us all to use something else besides docker as the runtime. And they are growing - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/implementations.md&quot;&gt;steadily&lt;/a&gt;. Docker is no longer the only runtime that is being used. Their is a growth in the community - that are slowly sharing the knowledge of how use something else besides Docker. Kelsey Hightower - has updated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way&quot;&gt;Kubernetes the hard way&lt;/a&gt; (amazing work - honestly) over the years from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o)%20v1.0.0-beta.0&quot;&gt;CRI-O&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/containerd/containerd&quot;&gt;containerd&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/gvisor&quot;&gt;gvisor&lt;/a&gt;. All the cool kids on the block are no longer using docker as the underlying runtime. There are many other options out there today &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clearcontainers/runtime&quot;&gt;clearcontainers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://katacontainers.io/&quot;&gt;katacontainers&lt;/a&gt; and the list is continuously growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Most people (including myself) do not have enough knowledge and expertise of how to swap out the runtime to what ever they would like and usually just go with the default out of the box. When people understand that they can easily make the choice to swap out the container runtime, and the knowledge is out there and easily and readily available, I do not think there is any reason for us to user docker any more and therefore Docker as a technology and as a company will slowly vanish. The other container runtimes that are coming out will be faster, more secure, smarter, feature rich (some of them already are) compared to what Docker has to offer. If you have a better, smarter, more secure product - why would people continue to use technology that no longer suits their ever increasing needs?&lt;p&gt;For Docker - to avert this outcome - I would advise to invest as much energy as possible - into creating the best of breed runtime for any workload - so that docker remains the de-facto standard that everyone uses. The problem with this statement - is that there no money in a container runtime. Docker never made money on their runtime, they looked for their revenue on the enterprise features above and on top the container runtime. How they are going to solve this problem - is beyond me and the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The docker community has been steadily declining, the popularity of the events has been declining, the number of new features, announcements - is on the decline and has been on the decline for the past year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone told me a while back - that speaking bad about things or giving bad news is usually very easy. We can easily say that this is wrong, this is no useful, this should change. But without providing a positive twist on something - you become the “doom and gloom”. The “grim reaper”. Don’t be that person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to heed their advice, and with that add something about - what that means for you today. You should start investing in understanding how these other runtimes can help you, where they fit, increase your knowledge and expertise - so that you can prepare for this and not be surprised when everyone else stops using docker and you find yourself having to rush into adapting all your infrastructure. I think it is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was the post I wanted to write 8 months ago...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What triggered me to finish this post today was a post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fatherlinux&quot;&gt;Scott Mccarty&lt;/a&gt; - about the upcoming RHEL 8 beta - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta-new-set-container-tools&quot;&gt;Enterprise Linux 8 Beta: A new set of container tools&lt;/a&gt; - and my tweet that followed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

Lo and behold - no more docker package available in RHEL 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a container veteran, you may have developed a habit of tailoring your systems by installing the “docker” package. On your brand new RHEL 8 Beta system, the first thing you’ll likely do is go to your old friend yum. You’ll try to install the docker package, &lt;strong&gt;but to no avail&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are crafty, next, you’ll search and find this package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;podman-docker.noarch : &quot;package to Emulate Docker CLI using podman.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this Podman we speak of? The &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;docker package is replaced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; by the Container Tools module, which consists of Podman, Buildah, Skopeo and several other tidbits. There are a lot of new names packed into that sentence so, let’s break them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Hackers ransack Citrix, make off with 6TB+ of emails, biz docs, secrets</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/08/citrix_hacked_data_stolen/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/08/citrix_hacked_data_stolen/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Updated&lt;/strong&gt; Citrix today warned its customers that foreign hackers romped through its internal company network and stole corporate secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enterprise software giant – which services businesses, the American military, and various US government agencies – said it was told by the FBI on Wednesday that miscreants had accessed Citrix's IT systems and exfiltrated files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to little-known infosec firm Resecurity, which claimed it had earlier alerted the Feds and Citrix to the cyber-intrusion, at least &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://resecurity.com/blog/supply-chain-the-major-target-of-cyberespionage-groups/&quot;&gt;six terabytes of sensitive internal files&lt;/a&gt; were swiped from the US corporation by the Iranian-backed IRIDIUM hacker gang. The spies hit in December, and Monday this week, we're told, lifting emails, blueprints, and other documents. The hackers have ways to bypass multi-factor login systems to slip into private networks, it is claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The incident has been identified as a part of a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign supported by nation-state due to strong targeting on government, military-industrial complex, energy companies, financial institutions and large enterprises involved in critical areas of economy,&quot; Team Resecurity said in a statement earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outfit's specific claims have not been independently verified, we note, so at this time, &lt;em&gt;caveat lector&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Based our recent analysis,&quot; the company continued, &quot;the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques and procedures, allowing them to conduct targeted network intrusion to access at least six terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including email correspondence, files in network shares, and other services used for project management and procurement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LA-based Resecurity added that IRIDIUM &quot;has hit more than 200 government agencies, oil and gas companies, and technology companies including Citrix.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resecurity also said it warned Citrix on December 28 that the software giant had been turned over by the hacker crew during the Christmas period. Citrix, meanwhile, said it took action – launching an internal probe and securing its networks – after hearing from the FBI earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ongoing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Citrix chief information security officer Stan Black gave &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/03/08/citrix-investigating-unauthorized-access-to-internal-network/&quot;&gt;his company's side of the story&lt;/a&gt;. He said that, as of right now, Citrix does not know exactly which documents the hackers obtained nor how they got in – the FBI thinks it was by brute-force &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/password-spraying/&quot;&gt;password spraying&lt;/a&gt; – nor for how long they may have been camping on the corporate network. Black also described the thieves as &quot;international cyber-criminals&quot; rather than point the finger at any particular country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While our investigation is ongoing, based on what we know to date, it appears that the hackers may have accessed and downloaded business documents,&quot; he said. &quot;The specific documents that may have been accessed, however, are currently unknown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Citrix reckons the intrusion was limited to its corporate network, and thus believes customer records and data were not stolen nor touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, however, it's anyone's guess as to what exactly the hackers may have lifted. As a massive provider of remote management, networking, and videoconferencing products, Citrix has a large portfolio spread across a number of sectors in the business and government IT markets. Its customers include the White House and the FBI, though it's not known at the moment whether the hack involved or menaced Uncle Sam's operations directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/03/10/password_648x429.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;citrix&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;No reason to panic, apparently: Redoing login details to become a regular thing&quot;&gt;Customers baffled as Citrix forces password changes for document-slinging Sharefile outfit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/12/04/password_change_for_sharefile/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the investigation is in its extremely early phases, Citrix said it will provide customers with regular updates as it gets more details. For now, Citrix said it is planning to cooperate fully with the FBI probe, and has also brought in an outside security firm to help investigate the intrusion and make sure that hackers will not be able to get back in to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Citrix is moving as quickly as possible, with the understanding that these investigations are complex, dynamic and require time to conduct properly,&quot; Black said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In investigations of cyber incidents, the details matter, and we are committed to communicating appropriately when we have what we believe is credible and actionable information.&quot; ®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story was revised after publication to include Resecurity's version of events. A spokesperson for Citrix confirmed &quot;Stan’s blog refers to the same incident&quot; described by Resecurity, adding: &quot;We have no further comment at this time, but as promised, we will provide updates when we have what we believe is credible and actionable information.&quot; Resecurity declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, was it the Iranians, or not? What data was stolen? Is it too early to tell? On the one hand, Resecurity previously &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://resecurity.com/blog/parliament_races/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the Iran-linked IRIDIUM team attacked the Australian parliament's computers, yet sources close to the Oz government &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/18/australia_pm_scott_morrison_state_level_hackers_parliament_breach/&quot;&gt;reckoned&lt;/a&gt; it appeared to be the work of China, though it could be another nation state masquerading as the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Microsoft &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/iranian-hackers-have-hit-hundreds-of-companies-in-past-two-years-11551906036&quot;&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; said hundreds of companies have been hacked by Iranian miscreants over the past two years. The plot thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
