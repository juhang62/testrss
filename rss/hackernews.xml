&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story of the 3dfx Voodoo1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/3dfx_logo.svg&quot; /&gt; This article is the second entry in a series about the &quot;3D cards of the late 90s running Quake&quot;. The first entry&lt;a name=&quot;back_1&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_1&quot; id=&quot;back_1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; took a look at the end of 1996 with the Rendition Vérité 1000 and its dedicated port called vQuake. Rendition had managed to beat everybody to Quake-market. For a brief period of time they had the one and only board capable to run id Software's blockbuster with hardware-acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything changed on January 1997, when id Software released a new version of Quake called GLQuake. Because the port was done using miniGL (a subset of OpenGL 1.1 standard), any hardware-accelerator manufacturer could provide miniGL drivers and enter the 3D race. From that point onward, the competition would be open to everybody. The goal was to generate as many frames per second as possible. The rewards were fame and customer's money. A brief search revealed that the two authorities of the time were unambiguous about who was at the top of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all there's currently hardly any doubt about it, Voodoo rules the Quake world. Now since Quake rules the gaming world, 3Dfx Voodoo is pretty much unavoidable for any gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3DFX Voodoo 1&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;The benchmark against which everything else is measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a first peek at the specs&lt;a name=&quot;back_3&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_3&quot; id=&quot;back_3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; claiming a 50 Mpixels/second fillrate figure, I was eager to fully immerse into it and find out what 3dfx had done to produce such an indisputable powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3dfx Interactive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross Smith, Scott Sellers, and Gary Tarolli originally met while working at SGI&lt;a name=&quot;back_4&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_4&quot; id=&quot;back_4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After a short stint at Pellucid where they tried to sell IrisVision boards for PC (at 1994 $4,000/piece), they started they own company with backing from Gordie Campbell's TechFarm. Headquartered in San Jose, California, 3dfx Interactive was founded in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially intending to design powerful hardware solutions for arcade games, 3dfx pivoted in order to design PC add-on boards. There were three reasons for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The price of RAM was low enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting with FastPage RAM and then with EDO RAM, the latency of RAM had improved 30%. It could now be clocked at up to 50Mhz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D (or pseudo-3D) games were becoming more and more popular. Success of titles such as DOOM, Descent, and Wing Commander III showed that a market for 3D acceleration cards was about to emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;They figured they could design something powerful, dedicated to games, and retailing in the $300-$400 range. In 1996 the company announced the SST1 (named after the founders Sellers-Smith-Tarolli-1) architecture which was promptly licensed by several OEMs such as Diamond, Canopus, Innovision, and ColorMAX. The marketing name given to their creation was &quot;Voodoo1&quot; for its magic like performances properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with the V1000, EOM'es only leverage on the cards they produced was the RAM they selected (EDO vs DRAM), the color of the resin and the physical layout of the chips. Pretty much everything else was standardized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/sst1_drawing.svg&quot; /&gt; What is mesmerizing when taking a look at an SST1 board are the divergences from its competitors, the Rendition Verite 1000 and the NVidia NV1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, 3dfx had made the audacious choice to not support 2D rendering. The Voodoo1 had two VGA ports, one acting as output and the other as input. The card was designed as an add-on which took as input the output of the 2D VGA card already installed in a PC. When the user was running the operating system (DOS or Windows), the Voodoo1 was just a pass-through which did nothing but to relay the signal from its VGA input to its VGA output. When entering 3D mode, the Voodoo1 took over the VGA output port and discarded the signal on its VGA input. Some boards had a mechanical switch which would generate an audible &quot;click&quot; when switching between 2D and 3D mode. This choice also meant the card could only do fullscreen rendition, there was no &quot;windowed&quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second remarkable aspect of the SST1 is that is was made of not one CPU but two non-programmable ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). If you follow the bus lines, you can see that each chips, labeled &quot;TMU&quot; and &quot;FBI&quot;, had its own RAM. On a 4MiB card, the RAM was divided equally with 2MiB for the TMU to store textures and 2MiB for the FBI to store the color and z buffer where values were stored respectively as 16-bit RGBA and 16-bit integer/half-float. A 4MiB card supported a resolution up to 640x480 (2 color buffer (640x480x2) for double-buffering + 1 depth buffer (640x480x2) = 1,843,200). Later models with 4MiB FBI RAM allowed up to 800x600 (2x800x600x2 + 800x600x2 = 2,880,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SST1 Rendering pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline is not explicitly detailed in the specs. My interpretation is that the life of a triangle is made of five stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/sst1_pipeline.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A triangle is created and transformed on the computer main CPU (usually a Pentium). These operations include modelview/projection multiplication matrix, culling, per-vertex perspective-divide, homogeneous coordinate clipping, and view port transform. At the end of the process, all what remains are visible screenspace triangles (because of clipping, one triangle can result in two sub-triangles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triangles are send to the Frame Buffer Interface (a.k.a FBI) via a triangleCMD command over the PCI bus. They are converted to scanlines requests issued to the Texture Mapping Unit. For each scanline element (called fragment), the TMU performs up to four texture lookup per pixel when bilinear filtering is required by the developer. Per-fragment perspective-divide is also done in the TMU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TMU sends fragments to the FBI as textured 16-bit RGBA color value + a 16-bit z-value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FBI performs fragment z-buffer tests against its dedicated RAM storing the framebuffer RGBA and z values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, a fragment is lit via its color attribute and a 64-entry fog lookup. If blending is requested, the FBI combines the incoming fragment with what was already in the color buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a 3D enthusiast you probably know about the fast inverse square root code popularized by Quake 3 source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; Q_rsqrt&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; number&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; x2&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; threehalfs &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    x2 &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; number &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    y  &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; number&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    i  &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span&gt;// evil floating point bit level hacking&lt;/span&gt;
    i  &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0x5f3759df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span&gt;// what the fuck? &lt;/span&gt;
    y  &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    y  &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; threehalfs &lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; x2 &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;// 1st iteration&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; y&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his quest&lt;a name=&quot;back_5&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_5&quot; id=&quot;back_5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to find out the origin of Q_rsqrt, &quot;Rys for Software&quot; got in touch with Gary Tarolli who mentioned having used the code since his days at SGI. It is fair to assume the trick was also used in the SST1 pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does not compute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the pipeline in mind and knowing that every component (TMU, FBI, EDO RAM) was clocked at 50Mhz, it is obvious that the math does not add up to reach 50 MPixel/second. There were two problems to solve here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the TMU unit had to read four texels to perform bilinear filtering on a texture. This means four round trips to the RAM which would have resulted in TMU starvation and 50/4 = 12.5MPixel/s fillrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a second choke point at the FBI level. If z-buffer testing is enabled, an incoming fragment z value needs to be compared to what is already in the z-buffer before either writing or discarding it. If the test succeed, the value needs to be written. These are two RAM operations which should have resulted in an halved 50/2= 25 MPixel/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMU 4-way interleave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution to the four samples problem in the TMU stage is mentioned in the SST1 specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The texture memory datapath is fully interleaved, which allows an individual bank to access data irrespective of the address used to access data in other banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- SST1 specs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not specified if the bus used address multiplexing or if the data and address lines were shared. Drawing it non-multiplex and non-shared makes things easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/tmu_4_ways.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the details, the TMU architecture allowed to retrieve 4 x 16-bit texels per clock. With the inputs coming at the correct rate, the TMU was able to perform per-fragment w-divide then generate a fragment z value (16-bit) and a fragment color (16-bit) which were passed down to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FBI 2-way interleave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution to the two RAM access in the FBI stage is not explicitly mentioned in the specs. However the document does mention a fillrate of 100 MPixels/second on glClear due to the ability to write two pixels/clock which suggests a 2-way interleave was used there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/fbi_2_ways.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI read and wrote pixels two at a time (2 x 1 pixel made of 16-bit color and 16-bit z = 64 bits). To do that, the 21-bit address generates two 20-bit where the least significant bit is discarded to read/write two consecutive pixels. Since the scanline algorithm required to write/read on horizontal lines going from left to right, reading two consecutive pixels at a time worked very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMU-&amp;gt;FBI 64-bit bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle is the 64-bit FBI-TMU bus. There is next to nothing in the specs about this but the behavior can be inferred from what the FBI consumes. Since the FBI worked two-pixels at a time, it is reasonable to assume the TMU did not send texels as fast as possible but instead batched them two at a time as two 16-bit color + 16-bit z-value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming the Voodoo1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its lowest level, programming the Voodoo1 was done using memory mapped registers. The API is made of a surprisingly low number of five register commands TRIANGLECMD (fixed-point), FTRIANGLECMD (floating-point), NOPCMD (no-op), FASTFILLCMD (buffer clear), and SWAPBUFFERCMD associated with a load of data registers to configure blending, z-test, upload a fog colors, and many more. Textures upload to VRAM was done via 8MiB of PCI write-only memory-mapped RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming the Voodoo1 (for real)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, programming the Voodoo1 was done though its Glide API&lt;a name=&quot;back_6&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_6&quot; id=&quot;back_6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design of the API was logically inspired of IRIS GL/OpenGL, with a state machine and prefix for everything (except that it used &quot;gr&quot; instead of &quot;gl&quot; and programmers had to manage VRAM like in Vulkan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;glide.h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   GrHwConfiguration hwconfig&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   grGlideInit&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   grSstSelect&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   grSstQueryHardware&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;hwconfig&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   grSstSelect&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   grSstWinOpen&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;null&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; GR_RESOLUTION_640x480&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; GR_REFRESH_60HZ&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
     GR_COLORFORMAT_RGBA&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; GR_ORIGIN_LOWER_LEFT&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   GrVertex A&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; B&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; C&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   grDrawTriangle&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;B&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   grBufferSwap&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   grGlideShutdown&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiniGL &quot;standard&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though MiniGL was a subset of the OpenGL 1.1 standard, there was never a spec for it. MiniGL was &quot;whatever function Quake uses&quot;. Utility objdump running against quake.exe binary makes it easy to build an &quot;official&quot; list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

glColor4f        glFrustum          glReadBuffer        glVertex2f
glColor4fv       glGetFloatv        glReadPixels        glVertex3f

glDepthFunc      glHint             glScalef            glViewport
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you learned OpenGL recently, you may be intrigued by function names suchs as glColor3f, glTexCoord2f, glVertex3f, glTranslatef, glBegin, and glEnd. These were used for something called &quot;Immediate mode&quot; where vertex coordinate, texture coordinate, matrix manipulation and color were specified one function call at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how one textured and gouraud shaded triangle was drawn &quot;back in the days&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Render &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;glEnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;GL_TEXTURE_2D&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;glShadeModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;GL_SMOOTH&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;glBindTexture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;GL_TEXTURE_2D&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;// Assume a texture was loaded in textureId=1&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;glOrtho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span&gt;glColor3f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;glTexCoord2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;glVertex3f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;glEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLQuake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum of 50MPixels/second fillrate should have delivered close to 50 frames per seconds in 640x480. However because Quake combined two texture layers per surface (one for the color and one for the lightmap), the SST1 had to draw each frame twice with additional blending on the second pass. As a result, combined to a P166Mhz, Quake ran at 26 fps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering the resolution to 512x384 on the same machine provided a butter smooth 41 fps&lt;a name=&quot;back_7&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_7&quot; id=&quot;back_7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which was beyond anything competitors of the time could achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/demo2_frame1324_sst1.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; id=&quot;demo2_frame1324_software.png&quot; name=&quot;demo2_frame1324_software.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; The SST1 was not for everybody. Some people loved their pixels and found bilinear filtering &quot;blurry&quot;. Some other people were annoyed with the loss of gamma correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11.383445945946&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glquake looks like shit. I know a few of you may argue here, but really, lets face it - it looks terrible, especially on NVidia cards. Its not too bad on a 3dfx board... the colors are washed out though. On a TNT2 its disgraceful; way too dark and murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7.4146341463415&quot;&gt;- @Frib, Unofficial Glquake &amp;amp; QW Guide&lt;a name=&quot;back_8&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_8&quot; id=&quot;back_8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3fdx Voodoo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/3dfx2_drawing.svg&quot; /&gt; To say that 3dfx ruled from 1996 to 1998 would be an understatement. After the SST1, the Voodoo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; doubled down on performance with 100Mhz EDO RAM, ASICs clocked at 90Mhz, and not one but two TMUs allowing to draw Quake multitextured frame (color + lightning) in a single pass&lt;a name=&quot;back_9&quot; href=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/index.html#footnote_9&quot; id=&quot;back_9&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The thing was a beast and even the hardware looked gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fill-rate of a Voodoo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was nearly doubled to reach 90 MPixel/s. Quake benchmarks took off to an astonishing 80 fps on a Pentium II 266 MMX (compared to 56 fps with a Voodoo1) effectively maxing out both the game logic and display monitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fabiensanglard.net/3dfx_sst1/Voodoo2_super_fhq12MiB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Voodoo 2 12MB, courtesy of vgamuseum.info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the history of 3dfx took a cruel turn with the release of the Voodoo3 in 1999. As it was attempting to build its own all-in-one cards and stopped providing OEMs with its design, the company had to face increasing competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition did not go as well as expected and Voodoo3 performance was judged disappointing compared to the GeForce 256 from NVidia which was capable of hardware T&amp;amp;L (the part done by the Pentium in the pipeline).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter NVidia, 3dfx canceled the Voodoo4 to work directly on a Voodoo5 featuring a VSA-100 (Voodoo Scalable Architecture). The plan did not go as expected when the &quot;Napalm&quot; as it was nicknamed found itself faced with the more powerful NVidia's GeForce 2 and ATI Radeon cards upon release. Ultimately, on 28 March 2000, 3dfx filled for bankruptcy and was purchased by NVidia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To whoever lived through the late 90s and had the pleasure to run a Voodoo1 or Voodoo2, 3dfx remains an icon symbolizing excellence. An ode to a much deserved success achieved through audacity, exceptional talent and hard-work. Thanks guys :)!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>93% of Paint Splatters Are Valid Perl Programs</title>
<link>http://colinm.org/sigbovik/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://colinm.org/sigbovik/</guid>
<description>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;SIGBOVIK - Colin McMillen&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale: 1, user-scalable=no&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,300italic&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather+Sans:700,300,300italic&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;../style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;93% of Paint Splatters are Valid Perl Programs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGGNMfmfpWB-DzWS3Jr-YLcRNRjhp3FKS6v0KELxXK8/preview&quot;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.html&quot;&gt;view the gallery of pretty Perl programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we aim to answer a long-standing open problem in the programming languages community: &lt;em&gt;is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answer this question in the affirmative: it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; possible to smear paint on the wall without creating a valid Perl program. We employ an empirical approach, using optical character recognition (OCR) software, which finds that merely 93% of paint splatters parse as valid Perl. We analyze the properties of paint-splatter Perl programs, and present seven examples of paint splatters which are not valid Perl programs.&lt;/p&gt;

— Jake Archibald (@jaffathecake) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1095706032448393217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 13, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepted for publication at SIGBOVIK 2019, held April 1st 2019 in Pittsburgh. Winner of a Unwitting Participation Ribbon, &quot;an unwelcome brand we’ve affixed to each paper determined after careful scrutiny to have included a genuine artifact, thereby furthering the admirable causes of open science and fruitful procrastination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGGNMfmfpWB-DzWS3Jr-YLcRNRjhp3FKS6v0KELxXK8/preview&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; or download a &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/2019.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;. Or grab the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sigbovik.org/2019/proceedings.pdf&quot;&gt;entire SIGBOVIK 2019 proceedings&lt;/a&gt;; I'm on page 174.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Supplementary Materials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.html&quot;&gt;all the paint splatters&lt;/a&gt; on a single page, along with the valid Perl source code corresponding to each. &quot;Not valid&quot; is written in red for those images which did not parse as valid Perl programs. If different OCR settings recognized multiple valid Perl programs, I chose the one that seemed the most &quot;interesting&quot;, according to my own aesthetic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters.tar.gz&quot;&gt;tarball of 100 paint-splatter images&lt;/a&gt; that were used as the main dataset for this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;source code not available yet because i am bad at GitHub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Errata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few paint splatter Perl programs that I didn't recognize as &quot;interesting&quot; until after the SIGBOVIK submission deadline. For example, this splatter is recognized by OCR as the string &lt;code&gt;lerzfijglpFiji-j&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/6b78f8696b05f9322b2dda21b6932776.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below is recognized as the string &lt;code&gt;-*?&lt;/code&gt;, which also evaluates to the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/e47b8463b359906947c66ec4c852a2a3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another surprising program is shown below; OCR recognizes this image as the string &lt;code&gt;;i;c;;#\\?z{;?;;fn':.;&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the string &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/803dd5a54c42ed93462c78ad7da357b0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this image is recognized as the string &lt;code&gt;;E,'__'&lt;/code&gt;, which evaluates to the string E__ in Perl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://colinm.org/sigbovik/splatters/dc86c1c3553705b7b2f973d5be9e0389.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;49c9&quot; id=&quot;49c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Software engineers go crazy for the most ridiculous things. We like to think that we’re hyper-rational, but when we have to choose a technology, we end up in a kind of frenzy — bouncing from one person’s Hacker News comment to another’s blog post until, in a stupor, we float helplessly toward the brightest light and lay prone in front of it, oblivious to what we were looking for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c52&quot; id=&quot;0c52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is not how rational people make decisions, but it &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; how software engineers decide to use MapReduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d64&quot; id=&quot;4d64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Joe Hellerstein sideranted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_NSKvCVFmk2E&quot; data-href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_NSKvCVFmk2E&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his undergrad databases class&lt;/a&gt; (54 min in):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is there’s like 5 companies in the world that run jobs that big. For everybody else… you’re doing all this I/O for fault tolerance that you didn’t really need. People got kinda Google mania in the 2000s: “we’ll do everything the way Google does because we also run the world’s largest internet data service” [tilts head sideways and waits for laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

How many stories are your data center buildings? Google chose to stop at 4, for this one in Mayes County, Oklahoma.
&lt;p name=&quot;7373&quot; id=&quot;7373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Having more fault tolerance than you need might sound fine, but consider the cost: not only would you be doing much more I/O, you might be switching from a mature system—with stuff like transactions, indexes, and query optimizers—to something relatively threadbare. What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/mapreduce_a_major_step_backwards.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/mapreduce_a_major_step_backwards.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major step backwards&lt;/a&gt;. How many Hadoop users make these tradeoffs consciously? How many of those users make these tradeoffs wisely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7a6&quot; id=&quot;f7a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;MapReduce/Hadoop is a soft target at this point because even the cargo culters have realized that the planes ain’t en route. But the same observation can be made more broadly: if you’re using a technology that originated at a large company, but your use case is very different, it’s unlikely that you arrived there deliberately; no, it’s more likely you got there through a ritualistic belief that imitating the giants would bring the same riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0dd2&quot; id=&quot;0dd2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Ok, so yes: this is another “don’t cargo cult” article. But wait! I have a helpful checklist for you, one you can use to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b256&quot; id=&quot;b256&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Cool Tech? UNPHAT.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22b2&quot; id=&quot;22b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Next time you find yourself Googling some cool new technology to (re)build your architecture around, I urge you to stop and follow &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UNPHAT&lt;/strong&gt; instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4d1b&quot; id=&quot;4d1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Don’t even start considering solutions until you &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Understand&lt;/strong&gt; the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; domain, not the solution domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6612&quot; id=&quot;6612&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;eNumerate&lt;/strong&gt; multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8e4f&quot; id=&quot;8e4f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Consider a candidate solution, then read the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt; if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2df9&quot; id=&quot;2df9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Determine the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Historical context&lt;/strong&gt; in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8f7d&quot; id=&quot;8f7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Weigh &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt; against disadvantages. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Determine what was de-prioritized&lt;/em&gt; to achieve what &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;843d&quot; id=&quot;843d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Think!&lt;/strong&gt; Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind?&lt;/em&gt; For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you’d elect &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use Hadoop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4 name=&quot;d47c&quot; id=&quot;d47c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You Are Also Not Amazon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;999b&quot; id=&quot;999b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;It’s pretty straightforward to apply UNPHAT. Consider my recent conversation with a company that briefly considered using Cassandra for a read-heavy workflow over data that was loaded in nightly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90ae&quot; id=&quot;90ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Having read the Dynamo paper, and knowing Cassandra to be a close derivative, I understood that these distributed databases prioritize &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;write availability&lt;/em&gt; (Amazon wanted the “add to cart” action to never fail). I also appreciated that they did this by compromising consistency, as well as basically every feature present in a traditional RDBMS. But the company I was speaking with &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; need to prioritize write availability since the access pattern called for one big write per day. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*2c9zLYMMHf0SMJRCs2rtUg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;600&quot; data-height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2c9zLYMMHf0SMJRCs2rtUg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Amazon sells a lot of stuff. If “add to cart” occasionally failed, they would lose a lot of money. Is your use case the same?
&lt;p name=&quot;b4eb&quot; id=&quot;b4eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This company considered Cassandra because the PostgreSQL query in question was taking minutes, which they figured was a hardware limitation. After a few questions, we determined that the table was around 50 million rows and 80 bytes wide, so would take around 5 seconds to to be read in its entirety off SSD, if a full FileScan were needed. That’s slow, but it’s 2 orders of magnitudes faster than the actual query. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53cf&quot; id=&quot;53cf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this point, I really wanted to ask more questions (understand the problem!) and had started weighing up about 5 strategies for when the problem grew (enumerate multiple candidate solutions!), but it was already pretty clear that Cassandra would have been the wrong solution entirely. All they needed was some patient tuning, perhaps re-modeling some of the data, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; (but probably not) another technology choice… but certainly not the high-write availability key value store that Amazon created for its shopping cart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d580&quot; id=&quot;d580&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Furthermore, You Are Not LinkedIn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a931&quot; id=&quot;a931&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I was surprised to discover that one student’s company had chosen to architect their system around Kafka. This was surprising because, as far as I could tell, their business processed just a few dozen very high value transactions per day—perhaps a few hundred on a good day. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;At this throughput, the primary datastore could be a human writing into a physical book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2da8&quot; id=&quot;2da8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In comparison, Kafka was designed to handle the throughput of all the analytics events at LinkedIn: a monumental number. Even a couple of years ago, this amounted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/running-kafka-scale&quot; data-href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/running-kafka-scale&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around 1 trillion events per day, with peaks of over 10 million messages per second&lt;/a&gt;. I understand that Kafka is still useful for lower throughput workloads, but 10 orders of magnitude lower?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*58fByP3ysdAKFlbH_KAWRQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;512&quot; data-height=&quot;320&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*58fByP3ysdAKFlbH_KAWRQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The sun, while massive, is only 6 orders of magnitude larger than earth.
&lt;p name=&quot;3874&quot; id=&quot;3874&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Perhaps the engineers really &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make an informed decision based on their expected needs and a good understanding of the rationale of Kafka. But my guess is that they fed off the community’s (generally justifiable) enthusiasm around Kafka and put little thought into whether it was the right fit for the job. I mean… 10 orders of magnitude!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4387&quot; id=&quot;4387&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You Are Not Amazon, Again&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86c5&quot; id=&quot;86c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;More popular than Amazon’s distributed datastore is the architectural pattern they credit with enabling them to scale: service-oriented architecture. As Werner Vogels pointed out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065&quot; data-href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this 2006 interview by Jim Gray&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon realized in 2001 that they were struggling to scale their front end, and that a service-oriented architecture ended up helping. This sentiment reverberated from one engineer to another, until startups with just a few engineers and barely any users started splintering their brochureware app into nanoservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e37&quot; id=&quot;2e37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But by the time Amazon decided to move to SOA, &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/2001annualreport.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/2001annualreport.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they had around 7,800 employees and did over $3 billion in sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;398&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y0LRyBrgv4U7NAgy3fLhlA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Bill Graham Auditorium in San Francisco has capacity for 7,000 people. Amazon had around 7,800 employees when it moved to SOA.
&lt;p name=&quot;6cd7&quot; id=&quot;6cd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That’s not to say you should hold off on SOA until you reach the 7,800 employee mark… just, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for yourself&lt;/em&gt;. Is it the best solution to your problem? What is your problem exactly, and what are other ways you could solve it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;46e6&quot; id=&quot;46e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you tell me that your 50-person engineering organization would grind to a halt without SOA, I’m going to wonder why so many larger companies do just fine with a large but well-organized single application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;f46e&quot; id=&quot;f46e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even Google Is Not Google&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;718d&quot; id=&quot;718d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Use of large scale dataflow engines like Hadoop and Spark can be particularly funny: very often a traditional DBMS is better suited to the workload, and sometimes the volume of data is so small that it could even fit &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;in memory.&lt;/em&gt; Did you know you can buy a terabyte of RAM for around $10,000? Even if you had a billion users, this would give you 1kB &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;of RAM&lt;/em&gt; per user to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;759e&quot; id=&quot;759e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Perhaps this isn’t enough for your workload, and you will need to read and write back to disk. But do you need to read and write back to literally thousands of disks? How much data do you have exactly? GFS and MapReduce were created to deal with the problem of computing over &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the entire web&lt;/em&gt;, such as… rebuilding a search index over &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the entire web&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*IIXjS60xq8fQOT_7IsbrQA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;670&quot; data-height=&quot;365&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IIXjS60xq8fQOT_7IsbrQA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Hard drives prices are now much lower than they were in 2003, the year the GFS paper was published.
&lt;p name=&quot;d448&quot; id=&quot;d448&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Perhaps you have read the GFS and MapReduce papers and appreciate that part of the problem for Google wasn’t capacity but throughput: they distributed storage because it was taking too long to stream bytes off disk. But what’s the throughput of the devices you’ll be using in 2017? Considering that you won’t need nearly as many of them as Google did, can you just buy better ones? What would it cost you to use SSDs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c157&quot; id=&quot;c157&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Maybe you expect to scale. But have you done the math? Are you likely to accumulate data faster than the rate at which SSD prices will go down? How much would your business need to grow before all your data would no longer fit on one machine? As of 2016, Stack Exchange served 200 million requests per day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;backed by just four SQL servers&lt;/a&gt;: a primary for Stack Overflow, a primary for everything else, and two replicas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ca91&quot; id=&quot;ca91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Again, you may go through a process like UNPHAT and still decide to use Hadoop or Spark. The decision may even be the right one. What’s important is that you &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;actually use the right tool for the job&lt;/em&gt;. Google knows this well: once they decided that MapReduce wasn’t the right tool for building the index, they stopped using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1a8c&quot; id=&quot;1a8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, Understand the Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;78a3&quot; id=&quot;78a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;My message isn’t new, but maybe it’s the version that speaks to you, or maybe UNPHAT is memorable enough for you to apply it. If not, you might try Rich Hickey’s talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hammock Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;, or the Polya book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069111966X&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069111966X&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;How to Solve It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or Hamming’s course &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Art of Doing Science and Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What we’re all imploring you to do is to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt;! And to actually understand the problem you are trying to solve. In Polya’s galvanic words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;0a27&quot; id=&quot;0a27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand. It is sad to work for an end that you do not desire.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I put 16 GB of RAM into one of my computers. The computer is using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxconnchannel.com/ProductDetail.aspx?T=motherboard&amp;amp;U=en-us0000474&quot;&gt;Foxconn P55MX&lt;/a&gt; motherboard with a Core i5 750. It’s old and could probably be replaced, but it still works for what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the interesting part. This motherboard doesn’t officially support 16 GB of RAM. The specs on the page I linked indicate that it supports a maximum of 8 GB. It only has 2 slots, so I had a suspicion that 8 GB sticks just weren’t as common back when this motherboard first came out. I decided to try anyway. In a lot of cases, motherboards do support more RAM than the manufacturer officially claims to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made sure the BIOS was completely updated (version 946F1P06) and put in my two 8 gig sticks. Then, I booted it up into my Ubuntu 16.04 install and everything worked perfectly. I decided that my theory about the motherboard actually supporting more RAM than the documentation claimed was correct and forgot about it. I enjoyed having all the extra RAM to work with and was happy that my gamble paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few months later, I tried to boot into Windows 10. I mostly use this computer in Linux. I only occasionally need to boot into Windows to check something out. That’s when the fun really started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-1210&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When GRUB came up, I navigated to the Windows 10 menu choice and hit enter. The Windows boot screen briefly showed up, and then I was immediately greeted with a Blue Screen of Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1211&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode.jpg 1286w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stop code was: ACPI_BIOS_ERROR. I did a bunch of Googling, and basically the gist of the error is that something is wrong with the ACPI tables in my BIOS. The ACPI tables tell your operating system how to set up the hardware among other things. Trying to boot from a Windows install USB stick resulted in the same error. So I guess Foxconn wasn’t lying. This computer doesn’t support 16 GB of RAM. Dropping the RAM back down to 8 GB resulted in a successful boot. RAM tests passed just fine too, so it wasn’t a matter of bad RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried contacting Foxconn support to ask about a potential BIOS fix, but didn’t receive a response. I found an email address on their website, and my message bounced. I don’t think Foxconn is in the motherboard business anymore. They don’t appear to provide support either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ordinary person would just give up at this point, and either stick with 8 gigs of RAM or get a new computer. I didn’t want to give up quite so easily. I knew that theoretically the computer could use 16 gigs, because it worked fine in Linux. So I started learning about ACPI and experimenting with my computer’s BIOS settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found an interesting section in the BIOS where I could play with some memory settings. One of the settings was “Memory Remap Feature”. I had it enabled. The documentation in the BIOS said that the option allows the “overlapped PCI memory” to be remapped above the total physical memory. Some Googling indicates you should turn it on when booting into a 64-bit OS. On a whim, I tried disabling it, and Windows actually booted! However, it told me that less than 4 GB of my RAM was usable. But this was nice — I had a way to get into Windows without having to physically remove RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu was the same. It limited me to less than 4 GB with the Memory Remap Feature disabled. At this point I was pretty sure there was some kind of memory mapping issue going on. I decided to look more into the ACPI_BIOS_ERROR code and what causes it. I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0xa5--acpi-bios-error&quot;&gt;this excellent Microsoft driver debugging document that explains the ACPI_BIOS_ERROR bug check&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for the document to help me, I clearly needed to find the four error parameters that used to be displayed with the blue screen on older versions of Windows. Windows 10 hides all the information by default, but I discovered that it’s possible to re-enable display of the extra error information by adding an entry to your registry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/a/1035736&quot;&gt;Here’s the excellent answer on Super User that pointed me in the correct direction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After applying the registry patch described in the linked answer, I re-enabled the Memory Remap Feature in my BIOS and booted Windows. The BSOD now showed four additional codes in the upper-left corner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-1024x661.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1212&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stopcode2-768x496.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect! So Parameter 1 is 0x0000000000000002. Looking at the Microsoft documentation, Parameter 1 being equal to 0x02 means there is a problem processing the resource list for the PCI root buses. Because Parameters 2, 3, and 4 all look like crazy values, they are probably pointers. And when they’re all pointers, Microsoft says the problem is that the PCI decode region overlaps with the list of memory regions returned by the BIOS E820 interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. This information was a bit overwhelming, but it gave me something to start researching. I learned about how the E820 BIOS call provides information about memory regions. I went back to Linux and looked at all the kernel startup info using the dmesg command, paying extra special attention to E820 and ACPI stuff. Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009ebff] usable&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000000009ec00-0x000000000009ffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000000e0000-0x00000000000fffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000cf77ffff] usable&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf780000-0x00000000cf78dfff] ACPI data&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf78e000-0x00000000cf7cffff] ACPI NVS&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf7d0000-0x00000000cf7dffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cf7ed000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fee00000-0x00000000fee00fff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000ffb00000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved&lt;br /&gt;BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000042fffffff] usable
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi PNP0A08:00: ignoring host bridge window [mem 0x400000000-0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;window] (conflicts with System RAM [mem 0x100000000-0x42fffffff])&lt;br /&gt;PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x0cf7 window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0d00-0xffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000bffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000d0000-0x000dffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xf0000000-0xfed8ffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00-ff]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! See that warning about the conflict? I hadn’t noticed it, but Linux had started printing that message at every boot after I installed the RAM. I tried booting into Linux with the Memory Remap Feature turned off in my BIOS. In that case, the last e820 region from 0x100000000 to 0x42fffffff was no longer present, and thus the conflict message also disappeared and the host bridge window from 0x400000000 to 0xfffffffff showed up as another “root bus resource” in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s my answer. The reason Linux works with 16 GB is because it notices the conflict and ignores the conflicting PCI range that ACPI provides, whereas Windows throws up its hands in disgust and pukes out a blue screen that says, “your BIOS has a problem!” I can’t blame Windows. There is definitely an overlap, so it makes sense that it gets confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I wasn’t sure if I should keep going. The last 768 MB chunk of my RAM from 0x400000000 to 0x42fffffff was mapped to the start of a huge area of the memory space that my motherboard uses for PCI stuff. Clearly if the motherboard is expecting PCI stuff to be there, something really bad could happen. So my motherboard only supports a total of 15.25 GB of RAM, and that’s that. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…Linux was working just fine without that extra PCI mapping area enabled! What if I could somehow modify the ACPI tables so that the big PCI range starts at 0x430000000 instead of 0x400000000? That would be just after the end of my RAM, so there would no longer be a conflict, and most of the PCI mapping window would still be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started digging into the ACPI tables. Luckily, Linux makes it really easy to dump them. There are tools out there, but you can also easily find the tables in sysfs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they all are. I was also excited because I discovered that GRUB has the ability to replace your ACPI tables with new versions. So if I could figure out which table was involved, I could install a new version of that table using GRUB and theoretically Windows would be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/iasl&quot;&gt;iasl&lt;/a&gt;, among other tools, to try to disassemble the different ACPI tables and find the 0x400000000 value so I could change it. Remembering that the value is probably little-endian, and it’s also probably 64 bits wide, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk&quot;&gt;binwalk&lt;/a&gt; to search through all the table files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
binwalk -R '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00' *
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found one result in the OEMB table. The next 64-bit word after it was 0x1000000000, which just so happens to be one more than the end address in the host bridge window conflict message. This looked like a very promising lead. The OEMB table is special because it doesn’t appear to be a standard table according to the ACPI specifications. Linux also complains that its checksum is invalid, but I don’t think it matters. I’m assuming you can guess what I did next…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a copy of the OEMB table, replacing the 0x00 byte directly before the 0x04 byte with 0x30 in order to change the value to 0x430000000 (remember, it’s little-endian). I put this modified copy in a file called /boot/oemb.dat in Linux. Then, I used GRUB to replace the OEMB table with my copy by temporarily inserting the following command into the boot command list (by typing the letter ‘e’ in GRUB with Ubuntu selected):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi --exclude=OEMB /boot/oemb.dat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that it tells GRUB to load all ACPI tables except the OEMB table, and then tells it to load the content of /boot/oemb.dat and add it as an additional table. This will effectively replace the old OEMB table with my new OEMB table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I booted up Linux…and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
acpi PNP0A08:00: ignoring host bridge window [mem 0x400000000-0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;window] (conflicts with System RAM [mem 0x100000000-0x42fffffff])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That damned error was still there. WTF? I guessed that maybe the PCI range was actually determined somewhere else, but I didn’t see anywhere else that particular value was defined. I verified that my patched OEMB table was indeed loaded, and went back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided to use iasl to decompile the DSDT table. Some sleuthing indicated that the DSDT table was going to contain a method called “_CRS” that is responsible for creating this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
iasl -d DSDT
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the _CRS method associated with the PCI bus in the resulting .dsl file, and it looked pretty complicated. The DSDT table contains actual code, so it’s not necessarily possible to simply search for table values. In my case, the _CRS method was fairly complex. I interpreted the code as best as I could. It led me to realize that the _CRS method was loading information from a different table in memory, starting at 0xCF78E064. I looked at my Linux dmesg boot log again, and found this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
ACPI: Early table checksum verification disabled&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: RSDP 0x00000000000F9820 000014 (v00 ACPIAM)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: RSDT 0x00000000CF780000 000044 (v01 012110 RSDT0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: FACP 0x00000000CF780200 000084 (v01 012110 FACP0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: DSDT 0x00000000CF780460 006FE7 (v01 946F1  946F1P06 00000000 INTL 20051117)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: FACS 0x00000000CF78E000 000040&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: APIC 0x00000000CF780390 00008C (v01 012110 APIC0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: MCFG 0x00000000CF780420 00003C (v01 012110 OEMMCFG  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: OEMB 0x00000000CF78E040 000082 (v01 012110 OEMB0821 20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: HPET 0x00000000CF78A460 000038 (v01 012110 OEMHPET  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: GSCI 0x00000000CF78E0D0 002024 (v01 012110 GMCHSCI  20100121 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: DMAR 0x00000000CF790100 000090 (v01 AMI    OEMDMAR  00000001 MSFT 00000097)&lt;br /&gt;ACPI: SSDT 0x00000000CF7917C0 000363 (v01 DpgPmm CpuPm    00000012 INTL 20051117)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha! It’s loading the information from the OEMB table. My hunch had been correct all along. So why didn’t replacing the OEMB table work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked again at my dmesg log after replacing the OEMB table. What I hadn’t realized was that GRUB relocates most of the tables, including OEMB, to a different area in memory if you try to modify them. The problem is that the DSDT table is hardcoded to look at 0xCF78E064 for things it needs to read out of the OEMB table. It assumes that’s where the OEMB table is loaded. So it wasn’t looking at my new modified table — it was still looking at the original table. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first inclination was to modify the DSDT to look at the new OEMB table location, but I felt like that was a bad idea for the future because new versions of GRUB might change the location of where the custom OEMB table is stored in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled on a different idea. GRUB has commands called write_byte, write_word, write_dword, and the read_ equivalents of them all. What if I used GRUB to modify the original OEMB table in place? BIOSes these days are compressed. The tables are probably loaded into RAM, so theoretically I should be able to modify the table values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did. I added the following command to my GRUB boot sequence as a temporary test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
write_byte 0xCF78E0B5 0x30
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This replaced the 0x00 byte just before the 0x04 byte with 0x30, transforming the 64-bit PCI start address of that final range into 0x0000000430000000. I didn’t bother updating the OEMB table’s checksum, because Linux was already whining to me that the checksum was incorrect, so it obviously didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted into Linux, and anxiously checked my dmesg log for the PCI stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x0cf7 window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0d00-0xffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000bffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x000d0000-0x000dffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xf0000000-0xfed8ffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x430000000-0xfffffffff window]&lt;br /&gt;pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [bus 00-ff]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! The 0x430000000-0xfffffffff window appeared as a new valid window in the list, and the conflict warning was gone. After verifying that Linux still worked fine, I tried booting into Windows with the same hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! I am now able to boot into Windows with 16 GB of RAM installed in my computer, as long as I use GRUB as my bootloader with the write_byte command above. The stock Windows 10 bootloader obviously won’t work, and if I ever reinstall Windows I’ll probably have to temporarily yank out half of my RAM so that the installer will boot. But it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To permanently add the fix to GRUB, I created a file called /etc/grub.d/00_patchbios containing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
# This file patches the BIOS in my Foxconn P55MX motherboard to work&lt;br /&gt;# properly when I have 16 GB of RAM installed. It's a nasty hack.&lt;br /&gt;# Basically, the BIOS is hardcoded in the OEMB ACPI table&lt;br /&gt;# to have a PCI address range from 0x400000000 to 0xfffffffff, but&lt;br /&gt;# that overlaps with 16 GB of RAM being installed, because the RAM&lt;br /&gt;# uses up (among other ranges) 0x100000000 to 0x42fffffff.&lt;br /&gt;# This patch changes the table to actually list a PCI range of:&lt;br /&gt;# 0x430000000 to 0xfffffffff&lt;br /&gt;echo &quot;write_byte 0xCF78E0B5 0x30&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I made sure to chmod +x it, and ran sudo update-grub. Now the patch is automatically applied when GRUB starts up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know how safe this is. I don’t know if the motherboard is actually hardwired to look at those addresses for PCI stuff or what. All I know is it passes my RAM tests. Since Linux has been working fine with the 16 gigs of RAM installed, I am not too worried. It’s possible I would have problems if I had more PCI/PCIe cards installed or something, but in my use case, it seems to behave fine. Obviously, your mileage may vary, and this hack isn’t going to directly work on other motherboards because every BIOS’s ACPI table is going to be a little bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a fun learning experience to share with the world! I hope you learned something from reading this post. I sure learned a lot just from the process of figuring this all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;COPENHAGEN — The squats and leg lifts were harder than they looked, and after a few sets, Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hands on his knees and attempted to compose himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In November, Aguirre, a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain, joined the five-man roster of Origen, a League of Legends team that competes in the game’s top European league. The players — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to. Now here they were, five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computers, sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think I’m going to puke my oatmeal,” said Aguirre, who is known in the gaming community as &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/origen-finalizes-its-2019-lec-roster-by-signing-mithy-and-kold&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mithy&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some years ago, traditional sports leagues were revolutionized by young analysts wielding computers. The way things had always been done, it turned out, was not always the best way to do things. Now echoes of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports, where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier, oddly, by the old, corporeal wisdom of traditional sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athletes may never end. In the meantime, though, gamers are increasingly acting like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Origen is one of two teams owned by Rfrsh Entertainment, an e-sports company based in Copenhagen. Two years ago, the organization hired Kasper Hvidt, a former captain of Denmark’s national handball team, to be its sporting director. Hvidt, 43, had no previous exposure to gaming. But that was the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;E-sports in recent years have crept into the mainstream, attracting &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2017/03/16/46-million-watched-live-esports-event-10-million-more-than-trump-inauguration-broadcast/#7e3651891f40&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new fans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/what-do-owners-of-patriots-rams-grizzlies-and-flyers-have-in-common-a-big-bet-on-esports/2018/01/17/63e5a916-fac7-11e7-8f66-2df0b94bb98a_story.html?utm_term=.4bc6764d8198&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new sponsors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/comcast-places-50-million-bet-on-esports-arena-in-philadelphia&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new investment&lt;/a&gt;. The top professionals now make six-figure salaries and earn even more with endorsements and prize money. And yet, Hvidt observed, their approach to performance remained amateurish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;A nutritionist now helps plan the team’s meals, so players who once subsisted on fast food now eat dinners like a recent one of salmon and vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pete Kiehart for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;In Copenhagen, Origen’s players are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pete Kiehart for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eating right, sleeping right, exercising, cleaning up for sponsors — these ideas have undergirded traditional sports for generations. In e-sports, they are regarded as almost radical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They don’t look at themselves as physical human beings,” said Hvidt, who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s common sense, in a way. But with them it was not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Rfrsh has a validating narrative under its belt. The company’s other team, Astralis, which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017. In 2018, the team earned $3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant years ever by any team in any e-sports game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And so Origen this year has set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement. As recently as last year, the players’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drinks, fast food and unresolved psychic tension. Now, their days are interposed with protein smoothies, yoga mats and slow-paced breathing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The effects of those changes, the team said, have been plain to see: After starting the current season with a 1-4 record, Origen went on a tear, winning 11 of its final 13 matches, finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoffs, which began Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These are little things,” Fabian Broich, Origen’s assistant coach, said. “But they add up, and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At Rfrsh, Hvidt has assembled a performance team — a physical trainer, a sports psychologist, a massage therapist, a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the players that combines scientific research, old-school sports wisdom and simple common sense. Broich, 28, a former professional soccer player from Germany, acts as a liaison between the management team and the players, implementing the principles on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The players, who hail from five European countries and range in age from 18 to 24, live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin, where the League of Legends matches are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience. In Copenhagen, they are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week. On Mondays, they meet with the team psychologist for an “empty-the-backpack” session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Every morning, the team meets for breakfast in Broich’s apartment, a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owls and notoriously late risers — out of bed at a reasonable hour. Their other meals are catered with guidance from the nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Before, I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day, eat McDonald’s two times, and that’d be it,” Patrik Jiru, 18, an Origen player from the Czech Republic, said as he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After breakfast, the players biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Last time we did this, my body was sore for three days,” Jonas Andersen, 24, an Origen player from Denmark known as Kold, said as he grabbed a medicine ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mikkel Hjuler, a trainer who works with Danish Olympians, guided the team through some gaming-specific exercises. He had the players wrap their fists inside elastic bands and flex their fingers. He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The players were willing participants, but they admitted that their ambitions, from a physical standpoint, were modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I’m O.K. with being chubby as long as I don’t pass out when I’m running — which, right now, I might,” Aguirre said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The players continue to train several hours a day in front of computers, but even those sessions now borrow elements from traditional sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters, Broich distributed magnesium pills and protein bars. (He keeps vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal, too.) Later, he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplements — moringa, matcha, maca, chlorella, açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In their meeting room, a quotation attributed to the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson — “The strength of the team is each individual member” — was scribbled on a dry-erase board. After one practice game, the team laid out yoga mats and stretched on foam rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The trainer Signe Find instructs Team Origen’s Jonas Andersen, left, who plays as Kold, and Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez, who plays as Mithy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pete Kiehart for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Trevor Henry, 31, a broadcast commentator for Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, marveled at how quickly the game’s competitive landscape was professionalizing. He was happy, for instance, that some teams were reconsidering their use of gaming houses, a classic e-sports setup in which players live and train together under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Go back just a few years: Professional players would play 10 to 11 hours every day and do takeout food every day,” Henry said. “Pizza boxes would stack up rooms. Laundry would never get done. I’ll be brutally honest: Teams didn’t wash the team shirts. They’d have the same team shirt that they’d wear 24 weeks in a year that has never seen detergent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This lifestyle — part monk, part fraternity brother — was not only accepted but also held up as the very reason the players were successful. But that wisdom is now being challenged, and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team, franchise model (akin to American sports leagues) has encouraged organizations to make more long-term investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last year, Fabien Devide, the chairman of Team Vitality, a French gaming organization, spent seven months embedded in his League of Legends team’s gaming house in Berlin. He was startled by what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a madhouse,” Devide said, describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundaries between personal and professional life. “It can become a toxic environment very quick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Devide said Team Vitality planned to move its players into separate apartments later this year. Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh, he said he was formalizing plans to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director, in the mold of Hvidt, to devise a program grounded in traditional sports ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Teams now understand that championships are won and lost in the details. When Origen was assembling its squad last year, Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundreds of questions to make sure it was building an emotionally compatible group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In December, the players convened for a preseason camp with one catch: no computers. Instead, the players spent several days completing trust exercises and discussing their dreams with Lars Robl, a sports psychologist who spent two decades in the Danish special forces — “the real Counter Strike,” he joked — and whose other clients include the Danish soccer club F.C. Midtjylland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Robl’s job now is to help the gamers see themselves as elite athletes, just like the soccer players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They have the same DNA,” Robl said. “They’re just not aware of it yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congestion pricing has the potential to significantly change how traffic flows through Manhattan streets, how commuters get around the city, how companies like Uber and Lyft operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But most radically, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/nyregion/new-york-congestion-pricing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;if the policy spreads&lt;/a&gt; it could challenge a deeply embedded cultural idea, requiring people to pay for something Americans have long demanded — and largely believe they’ve gotten — free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The idea of the open road evokes these intertwined meanings: The freedom to use it should be free. Residential street parking should be free. Traffic lanes should be free. Stretches of public curb dedicated to private driveways? Those should be free, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In other ways, the government has heavily subsidized driving, or hidden the reality of who pays for it in places no one sees. Local laws require off-street parking from businesses and housing developers, who pass on the construction cost of it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sightline.org/research_item/who-pays-for-parking/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to tenants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/business/economy/15view.html?_r=3&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;customers&lt;/a&gt; who may not drive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Federal and state governments fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee (and that have come to operate like less and less of one &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-15/gas-taxes-aren-t-paying-the-bills-for-roads-anymore&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in an era of fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They add up to a pretty giant system of subsidies,” said Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But they don’t look like what we often consider subsidies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This system looks to us, instead, like an entitlement — driving is an American right, and so the infrastructure that enables it should be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Congestion pricing is premised instead on the notion that public roads are a valuable and scarce resource. And we should pay in some places to use it not primarily to gin up revenue, but to help manage access for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s a huge departure from how we’ve culturally thought about this over the years,” said Kari Watkins, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In reality, the government is a monopoly provider of road space, and the government has largely chosen to give it away. It’s no surprise, then, that the vast majority of American commuters &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/10/03/americans-commuting-choices-5-major-takeaways-from-2016-census-data/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drive to work alone&lt;/a&gt;, or that all those lonely commuters (plus taxis, Ubers, buses and delivery trucks) cause congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the government holds down the price of something people value, Mr. Manville said, we get shortages. And congestion is effectively a shortage of road — one that occurs at the peak times when people want to use it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If we had that problem with other kinds of infrastructure or commodities, we’d charge people more for them. If airline tickets were particularly in demand, their prices would go up. If there were a run on avocados, grocers wouldn’t respond by keeping them as cheap as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The roads hold such a special position in our brain that we use logic around them that we would never use around everything else,” Mr. Manville said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Other countries have socialized health care, parental leave or housing, Jeffrey Tumlin, a transportation consultant at Nelson\Nygaard, pointed out. In America, we’ve socialized driving — and housing for our cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t let people put their self-storage containers in public parks, but it’s just fine to store their cars on other public land for free,” Mr. Tumlin wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Peter Norton, a historian at the University of Virginia, traces this thinking to the 1920s and ’30s, when industry groups and government officials were debating whether to fund America’s expanding roads with tolls, which were by then common on bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Road builders were happy to have tolls, and they appeared in places like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But auto clubs and car manufacturers dependent on car sales opposed them. They preferred a gas tax, a cost less visible to drivers every time they got in a car. Together, they were remarkably savvy about branding the choice as one between “toll roads and free roads.” (A 1939 federal report even &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.virginiaplaces.org/transportation/tollroadsfreeroads.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adopted that phrase as its title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Of course, there’s no such thing as a free road,” Mr. Norton said. “But they were making the ambiguous association between their cause and the great cause of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gsapp/projs/call-it-home/html/chapter10.2.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industry publications&lt;/a&gt; at the time linked the need for “free” roads to patriotism, the Bill of Rights, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/gsapp/projs/call-it-home/html/images/2-015.gif&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;even the Minutemen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today, because most people seldom pay directly for roads — or because general funds do — it can seem as if no one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Therefore the street transportation system has no cost,” said Yonah Freemark, a doctoral student in city planning at M.I.T., who runs the blog &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Transport Politic&lt;/a&gt;. “And therefore we can just expect to have unlimited parking, we can expect to have unlimited access to neighborhoods, for whatever reason, for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Take those expectations to their logical conclusion in a major city today, and you get 10-mile-per-hour road speeds, rampant double parking, clogged intersections and worsening commute times. You get, finally, the political will for congestion pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now the culture of limitless, cheap driving may begin to shift in some places. But it will take much longer to change the physical environment that has grown up around that culture over decades, leaving many people without good alternatives to driving alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Where there are few other choices, like reliable bus routes, congestion pricing risks burdening poorer drivers in particular. But that is a problem we’ve thought about before, too, Mr. Manville said, if we’re now willing to treat roads as we do other infrastructure. He pointed to “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/doas/home/lifelinedetail.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lifeline&lt;/a&gt;” utility services: subsidized rates for electricity and gas offered to users with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Fortunately, congestion pricing comes with its own built-in solution,” he said, “which is that it raises a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Agile Lite: Agile without all the burnout</title>
<link>https://github.com/davebs/AgileLite</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/davebs/AgileLite</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Agile software development&quot; is a great idea that's been overcomplicated by the publishing and consulting industries. Agile Lite is an attempt to simplify the situation. You do not need a book or a workshop to explain Agile Lite. You just need a text file with several paragraphs. This is that text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Lite is pretty simple. It can be applied to any project with people working on it, assuming that the work can be broken into smaller component tasks that we'll just call Issues. Like other agile methodologies, it utilizes short development cycles called Sprints. Somewhat uniquely, Agile Lite explicitly acknowledges the prevalence of burnout in the software development industry and attempts to mitigate it directly via a 3 weeks on/1 week off development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic setup is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week of each month is spent with project leads and stakeholders defining the upcoming &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt;. Despite a week being allocated, a sprint planning session should take no more than 2 hours and probably about 45 minutes if done correctly. It is an intentionally light week and many people may simply take the time off to paint or surf or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt; takes place during the remaining 3 weeks of the month. During this period, engineers will work on the Issues that were allocated to them during the sprint planning sessions. Because the team may be fully remote and distributed over time-zones, &quot;live&quot; meetings happen infrequently and most communication happens through the &lt;code&gt;issue tracking system&lt;/code&gt; (which is faster to work with than e-mail). A shared kanban board like Trello is a sufficient issue tracking system, but a spreadsheet is probably not. Daily standups are discouraged; a basic pulse on the project can be obtained by reviewing issue tracking system updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a &lt;code&gt;sprint&lt;/code&gt; has begun, Issues may not be added to the sprint, but they can be removed. This reduces context switching and that is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues that are not completed during the sprint are reviewed at the next sprint planning session and it's decided whether to move the Issue forward into the next sprint, put it back in the Backlog, or reassign it to a different developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue is either in the &lt;code&gt;backlog&lt;/code&gt; or in the &lt;code&gt;current sprint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, developers are encouraged to take the planning week off to allow their brain to recover from the previous sprint. There are no death marches. Developers don't work on the weekends. This all helps avoid burnout. Avoiding burnout is good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it. The system doesn't really prescribe engineering practices and I think that's ok. Engineering practices can be defined at a per project level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support work is done on a rotating basis because sometimes things do happen unexpectedly and need to be dealt with, but a surprising number of issues can wait until later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile Lite is a better, more sustainable way to develop software. It empowers software developers while delivering a consistently solid level of productivity to project stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Agile Lite, I encourage you to read:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MIT cuts ties with Chinese tech firms Huawei, ZTE</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-zte/elite-u-s-school-mit-cuts-ties-with-chinese-tech-firms-huawei-zte-idUSKCN1RG0FS</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-zte/elite-u-s-school-mit-cuts-ties-with-chinese-tech-firms-huawei-zte-idUSKCN1RG0FS</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has severed ties with Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp as U.S. authorities investigate the Chinese firms for alleged sanctions violations, the school said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT is the latest top educational institution to unplug telecom equipment made by Huawei and other Chinese companies to avoid losing federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;MIT is not accepting new engagements or renewing existing ones with Huawei and ZTE or their respective subsidiaries due to federal investigations regarding violations of sanction restrictions,&quot; Maria Zuber, its vice president for research, said &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2K528XI&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2K528XI&lt;/a&gt; in a letter on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborations with China, Russia and Saudi Arabia would face additional administrative review procedures, Zuber added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The institute will revisit collaborations with these entities as circumstances dictate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain’s Oxford University stopped accepting funding from Huawei this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re disappointed by MIT’s decision, but we understand the pressure they’re under at the moment,” Huawei said on Thursday. The company denies the allegations of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We trust the U.S. judicial system will ultimately reach the right conclusion,” Huawei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Zuber and Richard Lester, an associate provost at MIT who also signed the letter, referred questions about details such as how much research was likely to be affected to MIT spokespeople, who did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to MIT faculty at the start of the current school year, Lester wrote that in cases where U.S. and Chinese interests are in direct conflict, MIT would prioritize its home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She denies wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions forced ZTE to stop most business between April and July last year after Commerce Department officials said it broke a pact and was caught illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea. The sanctions were lifted after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry referred questions to the two companies, but said Chinese firms were required to abide by local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we ask that governments in countries where they are based provide a just, fair, and nondiscriminatory environment,” its spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a news briefing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese telecoms equipment makers have also been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries Beijing could use their equipment for spying. The companies, however, have said the concerns are unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
