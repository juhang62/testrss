<title>Why Bother with What Three Words?</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'll be wording this post carefully as &lt;a href=&quot;https://what3words.com/&quot;&gt;What 3 Words&lt;/a&gt; (W3W) have a tenacious PR team and, probably, have a lot more lawyers than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3W is a closed product. It is a for-profit company masquerading as an open standard. And that annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief primer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The world is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid&quot;&gt;sphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can reference any point on the surface of Earth using two co-ordinates, Longitude and Latitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long/Lat are numbers. They can be as precise or as vague as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans can't remember long strings of numbers, and reading them out is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;W3W aims to solve this. It splits the world into a grid, and gives every square a unique three-word phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the location &lt;code&gt;51.50799,-0.12803&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;///mile.crazy.shade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's all the problems I have with W3W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It isn't open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm used to generate the words is proprietary. You are not allowed to see it. You cannot find out your location without asking W3W for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want permission, you have to agree to some pretty &lt;a href=&quot;https://what3words.com/terms/&quot;&gt;long terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;. And understand their &lt;a href=&quot;https://what3words.com/privacy/&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://what3words.com/developers/api-licence-agreement/&quot;&gt;API agreement&lt;/a&gt;. And then make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://what3words.com/patents&quot;&gt;don't infringe their patents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot store locations. You have to let them analyse the locations you look up. Want to use more than 10,000 addresses? Contact them for prices!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the antithesis of open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3W refuses to publish their prices. You have to contact their sales team if you want to know what it will cost your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open standards are free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an earthquake struck Japan, street addresses didn't change &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/03/japanese-earthquake-when-tectonic-plates-shift-does-gps-still-work.html&quot;&gt;their physical location did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, a street address is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; 42 Acacia Avenue - but the Longitude and Latitude has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you think this is an edge case? It isn't. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/australia-moves-gps-coordinates-adjusted-continental-drift/&quot;&gt;Australia is drifting so fast that GPS can't keep up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does W3W deal with this? Their grid is static, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.what3words.com/hc/en-us/articles/208506269-How-will-what3words-handle-continental-drift-&quot;&gt;any tectonic activity means your W3W changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internationalisation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers are &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; universal. Lots of countries use 0-9. English words are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; universal. How does W3W deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &quot;cat.dog.goose&quot; straight translated into French? No! Each language has its own word list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to translate between languages. You have to beg W3W for permission for access to their API. They do not publish their word lists or the mappings between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I want to tell a French speaker where &lt;code&gt;///mile.crazy.shade&lt;/code&gt; is, I have to use &lt;code&gt;///embouchure.adjuger.saladier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosely translated back as &lt;code&gt;///mouth.award.bowl&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.what3words.com/mouth.award.bowl&quot;&gt;entirely different location&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not allowed to know what word lists W3W use. They take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.what3words.com/hc/en-us/articles/203105521-Is-a-3-word-address-in-French-or-any-other-language-a-translation-of-the-same-3-words-in-English-&quot;&gt;paternalistic attitude&lt;/a&gt; to creating their lists - they know best. You cannot propose changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17423421&quot;&gt;non-English word lists are confusing even for native speakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultural Respect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers are (mostly) culturally neutral. Words are not. Is &quot;mile.crazy.shade&quot; a respectful name for a war memorial? How about &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.what3words.com/tribes.hurt.stumpy&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;///tribes.hurt.stumpy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a temple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.what3words.com/weepy.lulls.emerge&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;///weepy.lulls.emerge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.what3words.com/grouchy.hormone.elevating&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;///grouchy.hormone.elevating&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both being at Auschwitz? Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.what3words.com/klartext.best%C3%BCckt.vermuten&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;///klartext.bestückt.vermuten&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;cleartext stocked suspect&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic computer science problem. Every sufficiently long word list can eventually be recombined into a potentially offensive phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Washing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3W know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/What3words&quot;&gt;the majority of technical people are not fooled&lt;/a&gt; by their attempts to lock down addressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include this paragraph to attempt to prove their openness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we, what3words ltd, are ever unable to maintain the what3words technology or make arrangements for it to be maintained by a third-party (with that third-party being willing to make this same commitment), then we will release our source code into the public domain. We will do this in such a way and with suitable licences and documentation to ensure that any and all users of what3words, whether they are individuals, businesses, charitable organisations, aid agencies, governments or anyone else can continue to rely on the what3words system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how they propose to bind a successor organisation. They don't say &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; licences they will use. If they go bust, there's no guarantee they'll be legally able to release this code, nor may they have the time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing stopping W3W from releasing their algorithms now, subjecting them to scrutiny by the standards community. They could build up a community of experts to help improve the system, they could work with existing mapping efforts, they could help build a useful and open standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they don't. They guard their secrets and actively promote their proprietary product in the hope it will become widely accepted and then they can engage in rent-seeking behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is not a new argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mate &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ldodds.com/2016/06/14/what-3-words-jog-on-mate/&quot;&gt;Leigh wrote about this three years ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/blog/location-grid-not-an-address/&quot;&gt;Lots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@piesse/open-location-code-what3words-74a3f810c18d&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18646650&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-what3words&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stiobhart.net/2016-01-15-stupidest-idea-ever/&quot;&gt;criticised&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.telemapics.com/?p=589&quot;&gt;W3W&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/what3words?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@what3words&lt;/a&gt; is bad technical idea, and ethically terrible too. But all VCs like patented economic rents so the juggernaut rolls on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/geomob?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#geomob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Andy Allan (@gravitystorm) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/753653845859962880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 14, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But W3W have a great PR team - pushing press releases which are then reported as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40935774&quot;&gt;uncritical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47705912&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent press release contains a &lt;em&gt;ludicrous&lt;/em&gt; example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Person dials the emergency services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person doesn't know their location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emergency services sends the person a link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person clicks on link, opens web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web page geolocates user and displays their W3W location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person reads out their W3W phrase to the emergency services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing... If the person's phone has a data connection - the web page can just send the geolocation directly back to the emergency services! No need to get a human to read it out, then another human to listen and type it in to a different system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is literally no need for W3W in this scenario. If you have a data connection, you can send your precise location without an intermediary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3W succeeds because it has a superficially simple solution to a complex problems. It is a brilliant lesson in how marketing and PR can help a technologically inferior project look like it is a global open solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not joking. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edelman.co.uk/work/what3words/&quot;&gt;branding firm says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edelman helped what3words frame their story to be compelling by tapping into human emotion.&lt;br/&gt;We also created a story for CEO Chris Sheldrick about how having an address can drive social transformation and business efficiency, securing profiling and speaker opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;Through paid social campaigns we re-targeted these stories, getting through to the decision makers that mattered most.&lt;br/&gt;We articulated their purpose narrative and refined their strategy to engage investors and excite the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/289635060758507521&quot;&gt;too much time to refute all their claims&lt;/a&gt; - but we must. Whenever you see people mentioning What3Words, politely remind them that it is not an open standard and should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Your periodic reminder that W3W is a closed and proprietary system, with opaque licencing, hefty pricing, and poor internationalisation.&lt;br/&gt;It does have a very good PR team though. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ch3e9cAfsn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Ch3e9cAfsn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>BBC podcasts on third-party apps</title>
<link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/d68712d7-bd24-440f-94a0-1c6a4cdee71a</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/d68712d7-bd24-440f-94a0-1c6a4cdee71a</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re like me, you might be feeling spoilt for choice at the moment with fantastic range of new and established podcasts out there to listen to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve just announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg&quot;&gt;second run of That Peter Crouch podcast&lt;/a&gt; - with a lots more coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have also seen that our podcasts are no longer available on certain Google products - including the Google Podcast app and Google assistant. I want to explain a little bit about why that has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Google launched its own podcast app for Android users - they’ve also said they will launch a browser version for computers soon. Google has since begun to direct people who search for a BBC podcast into its own podcast service, rather than BBC Sounds or other third party services, which reduces people’s choice - an approach that the BBC is not comfortable with and has consistently expressed strong concerns about. We asked them to exclude the BBC from this specific feature but they have refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a public service, we want our content and services to be available to as many people as possible and we make these available for free on a range of third-party apps. But as the BBC, funded by the licence fee payers in the UK, we have to ensure it is done in a way that is good for all audiences, according to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/policiesandguidelines/pdf/bbc_distribution_policy.pdf&quot;&gt;Distribution Policy&lt;/a&gt; - which has been agreed with Ofcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we think is important is pretty simple. We want people to have easy access to the wide range of BBC programmes, not just a select few, and be able to discover and listen to new ones really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK we have a creative and flourishing radio and podcast industry and the BBC plays a significant part in this, which we’re really proud of. So we want to make sure podcasts made in, and championing the UK, are prominent on global platforms. We also want to make our programmes and services as good as they can possibly be - this means us getting hold of meaningful audience data. This helps us do a number of things; make more types of programmes we know people like, make our services even more personalised and relevant to people using them, and equally importantly, identify gaps in our commissioning to ensure we’re making something for all audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, given the way the Google podcast service operates, we can’t do any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t like removing our content from services and certainly don’t do it lightly - but unfortunately until Google changes the way they look at this, for the good of listeners, our podcasts will not be available on some of their services. We are in discussions with Google to try and resolve the situation and will continue to work with them to try and come to a solution that’s in the best interests of all listeners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>YC Interviews in India</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-interviews-in-india/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-interviews-in-india/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that we’ll be holding interviews for the Summer 2019 batch in Bangalore for founders based in India. This will take place from May 7 to 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve received an increasing number of applications from India and this will allow us to interview more Indian founders. So far, we’ve funded over 40 companies from India, including ClearTax, Meesho and Razorpay. And we hope more of you will join the YC network soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be just like regular YC interviews in every way. There is no difference to the application, what we look for in an application, and our criteria for acceptance. If accepted, you’ll join the YC Summer 2019 batch immediately. The in-person program starts in June in Mountain View, California, but you’ll get funding and have access to YC partners and resources right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline to apply to meet us in Bangalore is Friday, April 12th at 8pm IST. We’ll let you know if you’re invited to interview by April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apply.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Apply here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to meeting you soon! If you have any questions, send us an email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:apply@ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;apply@ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can I apply to meet you in Bangalore even if I don’t live there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Yes. If you live in India, we highly encourage you to apply. We’ll reimburse travel to Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What does it mean if I don’t hear from you by April 16th?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: If you don’t hear from us, it’s because your application is still under review. We’ll consider it for interviews in Mountain View, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do I have to re-apply for the Banglore interviews if I submitted an application before you announced them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: No. We’ll consider any application submitted by April 12th for the Bangalore interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I let you know that my application is for Bangalore interviews?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: No need to indicate. Just apply and we’ll let you know. You don’t need to live in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Are travel expenses covered for the interviews?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Yes, travel expenses will be reimbursed if you don’t live in Bangalore already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Can I apply after April 12th?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Yes. If you do, we may not be able to meet you in Bangalore. We’ll consider it for interviews in Mountain View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do I need to be incorporated as a US Delaware-C corp to apply?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. We’ll interview any type of company even if you haven’t incorporated yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you considering conducting interviews in cities besides Bangalore?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Yes. You can check our blog for updates: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;https://blog.ycombinator.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3 name=&quot;62b0&quot; id=&quot;62b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;Misleading charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;24da&quot; id=&quot;24da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s start with the worst of crimes in data visualisation: presenting data in a misleading way. We &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; do this on purpose! But it does happen every now and then. Let’s look at the three examples from our archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;8185&quot; id=&quot;8185&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Mistake: Truncating the scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9QE_yL3boSLqopJkSBfL5A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot; data-height=&quot;569&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*9QE_yL3boSLqopJkSBfL5A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9QE_yL3boSLqopJkSBfL5A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A bit left-field
&lt;p name=&quot;f617&quot; id=&quot;f617&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This chart&lt;/a&gt; shows the average number of Facebook likes on posts by pages of the political left. The point of this chart was to show the disparity between Mr Corbyn’s posts and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d56&quot; id=&quot;9d56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The original chart not only downplays the number of Mr Corbyn’s likes but also exaggerates those on other posts. In the redesigned version, we show Mr Corbyn’s bar in its entirety. All other bars remain visible. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(Avid followers of this blog will have seen&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.economist.com/the-challenges-of-charting-regional-inequality-a9376718348&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.economist.com/the-challenges-of-charting-regional-inequality-a9376718348&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;another example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;of this bad practice.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d886&quot; id=&quot;d886&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another odd thing is the choice of colour. In an attempt to emulate Labour’s colour scheme, we used three shades of orange/red to distinguish between Jeremy Corbyn, other MPs and parties/groups. We don’t explain this. While the logic behind the colours might be obvious to a lot of readers, it perhaps makes little sense for those less familiar with British politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a1cc&quot; id=&quot;a1cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_corbyn.csv&quot; data-href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_corbyn.csv&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Download chart data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;d89a&quot; id=&quot;d89a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Mistake: Forcing a relationship by cherry-picking scales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*H21mduPmvzot3oaMThNfFQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot; data-height=&quot;670&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*H21mduPmvzot3oaMThNfFQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*H21mduPmvzot3oaMThNfFQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;A rare perfect correlation? Not really.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af17&quot; id=&quot;af17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The chart above accompanied a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/subwoofers&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/subwoofers&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story on the decline of dog weights&lt;/a&gt;. On first glance, it appears that the weight and neck sizes of dogs are perfectly correlated. But is this true? Only to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;10c7&quot; id=&quot;10c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the original chart, both scales decrease by three units (from 21 to 18 on the left; from 45 to 42 on the right). In percentage terms, the left scale decreases by 14% while the right goes down by 7%. In the redesigned chart, I retained the double scale but adjusted their ranges to reflect a comparable proportional change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e80&quot; id=&quot;9e80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Considering the jolly topic of this chart, this mistake may seem relatively minor. The message of the chart, after all, is the same in both versions. But the takeaway is important: if two series follow each other too closely, it is probably a good idea to have a closer look at the scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7413&quot; id=&quot;7413&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_dogs.csv&quot; data-href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_dogs.csv&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Download chart data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;182b&quot; id=&quot;182b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Mistake: Choosing the wrong visualisation method&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9GzHVtm4y_LeVmFCjqV3Ww.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot; data-height=&quot;670&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*9GzHVtm4y_LeVmFCjqV3Ww.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9GzHVtm4y_LeVmFCjqV3Ww.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Views on Brexit almost as erratic as its negotiations&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1a11&quot; id=&quot;1a11&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We published this polling chart in Espresso, our daily news app. It shows attitudes to the outcome of the EU referendum, plotted as a line chart. Looking at the data, it appears as if respondents had a rather erratic view of the referendum result — increasing and decreasing by a couple of percentage points from one week to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a5a5&quot; id=&quot;a5a5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of plotting the individual polls with a smoothed curve to show the trend, we connected the actual values of each individual poll. This happened, primarily, because our in-house charting tool does not plot smoothed lines. Until fairly recently, we were less comfortable with statistical software (like R) that allows more sophisticated visualisations. Today, all of us are able to plot a polling chart like the redesigned one above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;de86&quot; id=&quot;de86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another thing to note in this chart is the way in which the scale was broken. The original chart spreads the data wider than it should. In the redesigned version, I have left some more space between the start of the scale and the smallest data point. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chezvoila.com/blog/yaxis&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.chezvoila.com/blog/yaxis&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Francis Gagnon&lt;/a&gt; has put together a nice formula for this: aim for leaving at least 33% of the plot area free under a line chart that doesn’t start at zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe46&quot; id=&quot;fe46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_brexit.csv&quot; data-href=&quot;http://infographics.economist.com/databank/Economist_brexit.csv&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Download chart data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Built a Lisp Compiler</title>
<link>https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m very proud to announce the completion of my first programming language compiler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~tim/malcc&quot;&gt;Malcc&lt;/a&gt; is an incremental and ahead-of-time lisp compiler written in C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of my progress over the years and what I learned in the process. An alternate title for this post is: “How to Write a Compiler in Ten Years or Less”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/#mal-tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom if you don’t care about the backstory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Successful Failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dreamed of writing a compiler for nearly a decade. I’ve always been fascinated by how programming languages work, especially compilers. Though, I imagined a compiler as dark magic and understanding how to make one from scratch firmly out of reach for a mere mortal such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that didn’t stop me from doing and learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First, an Interpreter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, I started work on a simple interpreter for a made-up language called “Airball.” You can tell from the name how much confidence I had in myself to make it work. It was a fairly simple program written in Ruby that parsed the code and walked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree&quot;&gt;abstract syntax tree&lt;/a&gt; (AST). Once I realized it did kind of work, I renamed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seven1m/lydia&quot;&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt; and rewrote it in C to make it faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mpov.timmorgan.org/images/lydia.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lydia programming language syntax&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking the syntax for Lydia was quite clever! I do still enjoy the simplicity of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lydia was far from the compiler I wanted to make, it was a small taste that inspired me to keep going. Though, I was still plagued by unanswered questions of how to make a compiler work: &lt;em&gt;What do I compile&lt;/em&gt; to&lt;em&gt;? Do I have to learn assembly language?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second, a Bytecode Compiler and Interpreter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a next step, in 2014, I started work on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seven1m/scheme-vm&quot;&gt;scheme-vm&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines&quot;&gt;virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; for Scheme written in Ruby. I thought using a VM with its own stack and bytecode would be a nice middle-ground between an AST-walking interpreter and a full compiler. And since Scheme is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scheme-reports.org/&quot;&gt;formally specified&lt;/a&gt;, I wouldn’t have to invent anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tinkered off-and-on with my scheme-vm for over three years and learned a lot about how to think about compiling. But, in the end, I knew I couldn’t finish it. The code was becoming an unmaintainable mess and I still had a long way to go to completion. Without a guide or previous experience, I was mostly feeling my way around in the dark. It turns out that a language &lt;em&gt;specification&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as a &lt;em&gt;guide&lt;/em&gt;. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2017, I had shelved scheme-vm in search of something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter Mal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mpov.timmorgan.org/images/stepA_mal.png&quot; alt=&quot;final step diagram from the Mal guide, courtesy Joel Martin&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time in 2018 I happened across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kanaka/mal&quot;&gt;Mal&lt;/a&gt;, the Clojure-inspired Lisp interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mal was invented by Joel Martin as a learning tool and has since gathered over 75 implementations in different host languages! I knew when I saw all those different implementations that I could learn a lot about the process – if I got stuck, I could go consult the Ruby or Python implementation for cheats. Finally, someone who speaks my language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also figured that if I could get through the steps writing an interpreter for Mal, I could probably repeat those same steps to make a compiler for Mal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Mal Interpreter in Rust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first go was to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md&quot;&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; and build an interpreter. At the time, I was also heavy into learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; (I’ll save that for another blog post), so I created my own implementation of Mal in Rust: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seven1m/mal-rust&quot;&gt;mal-rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://seven1m.sdf.org/experiments/make_a_lisp_in_rust.html&quot;&gt;about my time using Rust here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was an absolute joy!&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot give enough praise or thanks to Joel for creating the excellent Mal guide. It has &lt;em&gt;detailed&lt;/em&gt; written steps, flowcharts, pseudocode, and &lt;strong&gt;tests&lt;/strong&gt;! – everything a developer would need to make a programming language from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the Mal guide, I was running the Mal implementation of Mal (written in Mal) on top of my Rust-hosted implementation of Mal. (2 levels deep, whew) I jumped on my chair in excitement when this worked the first time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Mal Compiler in C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I proved mal-rust to be a viable Mal implementation, I started researching how I could write a compiler. Do I compile to assembly? Do I dare compile directly to machine code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw an x86 assembler written in Ruby which intrigued me, but the thought of working with assembly gave me pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I happened across &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13250722&quot;&gt;this comment on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, which mentioned using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/tcc/&quot;&gt;Tiny C Compiler&lt;/a&gt; as a “compilation backend.” This seemed like a great idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TinyCC has a test file showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TinyCC/tinycc/blob/mob/tests/libtcc_test.c&quot;&gt;how to use libtcc&lt;/a&gt; to compile a string of C code from a C program. This gave the start I needed to build a “hello world” proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting again with the Mal step-by-step guide, along with my stale C experience, I was able to build a Mal compiler in a couple months worth of spare evenings and weekends. The process was a joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mpov.timmorgan.org/images/mal-tests.png&quot; alt=&quot;mal test suite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to test-driven development, you’ll recognize how valuable having a pre-done test suite is. The tests will guide you toward a working implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say much about this process, other than, again, &lt;strong&gt;the Mal guide is a treasure.&lt;/strong&gt; At each step, I knew exactly what what I needed to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tricky Bits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, here are some tricky bits specific to writing a Mal compiler that I had to figure out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macros must be compiled on-the-fly during compilation and ready to be executed during compilation of the program. This is a little mind-bendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “environment” (the tree of hashes/associative-arrays/dictionaries that holds variables and their values) needs to be present for both the compiler code and the resulting code for the compiled program. This is so that macros can be defined at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the environment is available at compile time, I originally had Malcc catching &lt;em&gt;undefined&lt;/em&gt; errors (access of a variable that was not defined) at compile time, but this broke expectations of the Mal test suite in a couple places. In the end, I disabled that feature so I could get the test suite passing. It would be cool to add it back as an optional compiler flag though, since it could catch a great deal of errors ahead-of-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compiled the C code by writing to three strings passed around in a struct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;: top level code – functions are written here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;decl&lt;/code&gt;: declarations – declaring and initializing variables used in the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;: where the main work is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a day thinking about writing my own garbage collector, but decided it could be an exercise for further learning at a later date. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hboehm.info/gc/&quot;&gt;Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector&lt;/a&gt; is an easy drop-in library and is readily available on lots of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s critical to be able to easily see the code your compiler is writing. Anytime my compiler saw the &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, it would spit out the compiled C code so I could review the mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Things I’d Do Differently&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing C code and trying to keep it indented was a bit of a pain and I wish I would have done something else. I believe some compilers write ugly code and then “pretty it up” with a library before writing it out. This is something to explore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appending to strings when generating code is a bit messy. I might consider building an AST and then converting that into the final string of C code. This should tidy up the code and give the compiler a nice bit of symmetry too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now the Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that it’s taken me nearly a decade to learn how to make a compiler. No, really. Each step along the way is a fond memory in my process of becoming a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I’m “done” though. There are still many hundreds of techniques and tools I need to learn to feel like a real compiler writer. But I can confidently say “I did it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the process I’d recommend to make your own Lisp compiler:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a language you feel comfortable in. You don’t want to be learning both a new language and how to make a language at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md&quot;&gt;Mal guide&lt;/a&gt; and write an interpreter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejoice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the guide again, but instead of executing the code, write code that executes the code. (Don’t just “refactor” your existing interpreter though. Start from scratch. Copy and paste is fine.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe this technique can be used with just about any programming language that compiles to an executable. For example, one could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a Mal interpreter in &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your Go code to:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;produce a string of Go code and write it to a file;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compile that resultant file with &lt;code&gt;go build&lt;/code&gt; (by shelling out).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, there’d be a way to control the Go compiler as a library rather than shelling out, but regardless, this is one way to make a compiler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Mal guide and your ingenuity, you can do it. If I can do it, so can you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Joel Martin for creating Mal and giving it to the world!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IBM purged ‘gray hairs’ and ‘old heads’ as it launched Millennial Corps: lawsuit</title>
<link>https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/27/ibm-purged-gray-hairs-and-old-heads-as-it-launched-millennial-corps-lawsuit/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/27/ibm-purged-gray-hairs-and-old-heads-as-it-launched-millennial-corps-lawsuit/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Technology giant IBM targeted “grey hairs” and “old heads” for negative performance reviews so it could oust them from the company as it formed a “Millennial Corps” and focused on hiring “early professionals,” a new age-discrimination lawsuit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past six years alone, IBM has discharged over 20,000 U.S. employees who were at least 40 years old in pursuit of a company-wide practice of using forced group terminations, referred to as ‘Resource Actions,’ to accomplish its goal of removing older employees from its labor force,” said the lawsuit filed Wednesday by four former IBM employees. Three had worked at the company for more than three decades, and one for more than 10 years, the suit said. All were over 55 when they were sacked in May 2016, according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit alleged that IBM required employees to submit claims of age discrimination to binding arbitration, but also banned them from collective arbitration over such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said in an emailed statement that the plaintiffs’ theories have been rejected by courts including the U.S. Supreme Court. “We are confident that our arbitration clauses are legal and appropriate,” the firm said. The company added that a body of Supreme Court cases upholds arbitration agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft size-article_inline_third lazyautosizes lazyload&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siliconbeat-logo-tech-news-blog.png?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siliconbeat-logo-tech-news-blog.png?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siliconbeat-logo-tech-news-blog.png?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/siliconbeat-logo-tech-news-blog.png?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 210w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purported purge started in 2014, with the firm carrying out a plan to fix its “seniority mix” by imposing an “aggressive performance management posture,” the suit filed in federal court in New York alleged. One in-house presentation showed that this posture meant doubling the proportion of workers receiving negative performance evaluations, so 3,000 employees could be laid off and replaced with “early professionals,” according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 2015 and 2016, IBM doubled down on its efforts to replace its long-tenured, older employees with the younger Millennials it sought to recruit,” the suit alleged. “IBM made presentations to its senior executives calling for IBM to evaluate its long-term employees more harshly, to use those negative evaluations to justify selecting long-term employees for lay-off, and to replace these employees with ‘EPs’— IBM management short-hand for ‘early professionals.'”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 presentation concerning one section of the company “specifically called for managers to exempt all ‘early professional hires’ from layoff, regardless of performance,” the suit claimed. “The long-serving, older employees were provided no such exemption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former employees suing IBM — Steven Estle, Margaret Ahlders, Lance Salonia and Cheryl Witmer — alleged the company in 2014 began downgrading their annual performance scores, so they started receiving worse evaluations than in previous years. When they were fired in 2016, IBM falsely characterized their departures as retirements, the suit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also starting in 2014, IBM began demanding that laid-off workers waive their right to collective action, the suit alleged. Employees were offered severance worth a month’s salary, continuing health and life insurance coverage for a period depending on time with the firm, free career counseling, and up to $2,500 for skills training, the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But workers would not receive any of those benefits if they didn’t sign an agreement not to bring age-discrimination claims collectively, even in arbitration, the suit claimed. By this arrangement, IBM sought to deprive workers of the economies and advantages of pursuing legal action together, and “instead to burden them with the limitations and costs of bringing individual actions challenging the same discriminatory practices in secret arbitrations separate from each other,” the suit alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With misgivings, but facing the prospect of a difficult job search and economic hardship, each Plaintiff reluctantly signed the waiver,” the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit took aim at a 2006 IBM internal report on employee demographics that purportedly called older workers “gray hairs” and “old heads,” and concluded that younger workers were “generally much more innovative and receptive to technology than baby boomers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, IBM launched a blog called “The Millennial Experience,” the suit said. The firm also created “Millennial Corps,” a network of young workers to be consulted by senior leadership about business decisions, according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related left&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
The suit cited a presentation given at a 2014 IBM event, in which slides shown allegedly indicated that Millennials exhibited desirable work qualities such as trusting data and making decisions through collaboration, while workers over 50 had undesirable attributes such as being “more dubious” of analytics, putting “less stock in data” and being less motivated to consult colleagues.
&lt;p&gt;The suit draws heavily from results of a ProPublica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/amid-accusations-of-age-bias-ibm-winds-down-a-push-for-millennial-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; published in September that said IBM appeared to be winding down the Millennial Corps, cited in several legal actions as evidence the firm was biased against younger workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking a court invalidating IBM’s waiver against collective action, a ruling that the matter go to collective arbitration, and unspecified monetary relief.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>F-35: What The Pilots Say</title>
<link>https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/f-35-faces-most-critical-test-180971734/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/f-35-faces-most-critical-test-180971734/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In my interviews with F-35 pilots, one word repeatedly came up: “survivability.” Surviving the Lockheed Martin F-35’s primary mission—to penetrate sophisticated enemy air defenses and find and disable threats—requires what the fifth-generation jet offers: stealth and a stunning array of passive and active sensors bringing information to the pilot. The F-35 can see trouble coming—ahead, behind, or below the aircraft—far enough in advance to avoid a threat or kill it. Faced with multiple threats, the sensor suite recommends the order in which they should be dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. forces first took these capabilities into combat last September, when Marine F-35Bs struck the Taliban in Afghanistan (five months after its combat debut with the Israeli air force). More than 360 of the multi-service aircraft—Air Force F-35As, Marine short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing Bs, and carrier-capable Cs—have been delivered to 16 U.S. airbases and to seven other countries. Reaching these milestones has not been easy. The program’s difficulties and its cost—$406 billion for development and acquisition—have been widely reported. But now the F-35 is in the hands of the best judges of its performance, its pilots. I asked eight of them—test pilots who contributed to the jet’s development as well as active-duty pilots—about their experiences. Here, in their own words, are their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Billie Flynn | Experimental test pilot, Lockheed Martin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A test pilot with the company for more than 15 years, Flynn flew the first F-35 airshow demonstration, at the Paris Air Show in 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/2kMhc_XufCAtAO7iTC3vgfcbOM4=/1024x596/filters:focal(1165x1165:1166x1166)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/14/b8/14b8a2e3-feb2-4c35-b309-bc7dba57a7d1/08f_am2019_billieheadshot_live.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Michael D. Jackson / Lockheed Martin)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For four years, all people could talk about was how we’d lost a dogfight against a 40-year-old F-16. Paris was the first time we showed what the airplane could do. The F-35 engine is the most powerful fighter engine in the world, so on takeoff, I pulled straight up. The F-22 Raptor is an airshow favorite because it is super maneuverable. It has thrust vectoring; it controls the engine exhaust with paddles that move. The F-22 can do a downward spiral, and I did the same thing in the F-35—without thrust vectoring. I pull up to vertical, skid the airplane over the top, and spiral down like a helicopter hovers. That pedal turn [executed with rudder inputs] ended the discussion of how an F-35 would perform in a dogfight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lieutenant Colonel David “Chip” Berke | USMC (ret.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first non-test pilot to fly the F-35, Berke commanded Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 502 at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. He is the only Marine ever to have qualified to fly the F-22 Raptor and served as the F-22 division commander at the Air Force’s 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;David Berke flew the Lockheed Martin F-22 before the F-35. Fifth-generation aircraft, says the pilot, offer a different set of capabilities from fourth-generation aircraft, and pilots must fly them differently as well.&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/tL3ziGLaczj5CCOd9JaGxY-XRjs=/1024x596/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/63/c2/63c2602c-c404-49f0-968c-cc2fc5b54c47/08j_am2019_berke_replaces-e_live.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David Berke flew the Lockheed Martin F-22 before the F-35. Fifth-generation aircraft, says the pilot, offer a different set of capabilities from fourth-generation aircraft, and pilots must fly them differently as well.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; David Berke flew the Lockheed Martin F-22 before the F-35. Fifth-generation aircraft, says the pilot, offer a different set of capabilities from fourth-generation aircraft, and pilots must fly them differently as well. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(Sgt Christine Polvorosa / USMC)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighter aircraft all have to have a level of performance and maneuverability: speed, Gs, turn rate, turn radius, acceleration, climb—all of those things. In the F-35, there’s not a massive change in those performance metrics. The F-35 is better [than legacy aircraft], but not a lot better. But those ways to measure an airplane are not nearly as relevant now as they used to be. They’re not irrelevant, but they are not as important as all the other qualities that you should be measuring an airplane by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to write down all the ways in which you could measure an airplane—payload, fuel, ordnance, handling—and ask 100 pilots to rank which is the most important, I guarantee you that 100 out of 100 pilots would say “situational awareness.” By far. Not a single pilot in the world would say “turn radius.” Not one. Because the more you know, the more accurately you know it, the better able you are to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situational awareness, the F-35 is superior to all platforms, including the Raptor. I’d never been in an airplane that so effectively and seamlessly integrates information to tell me what’s going on around me—and not just from the radio frequency spectrum, but laser, infrared, electro-optical. That’s usually the first thing people notice when they get in the airplane. They know so much more than they ever knew before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After situational awareness, you want to be able to dictate access regardless of the capability of the threat. A highly robust air-defense network can deny access. The biggest problem that legacy aircraft have right now is that the threat gets to dictate when and where we fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air-defense networks can also be limiting for stealth aircraft. The first thing you have to think about in the F-35 is managing your signature. In an F-18, you don’t even think about it because everybody sees you the minute you take off, so you don’t spend a lot of time trying to hide. Managing all the components of low observability is very challenging, and pilots have to think about it all the time. And they don’t do it well the first time. We all struggle with that initially. But you de-brief and analyze and start to build a database of the methods being used to detect you. You start to build a strategy that will keep others from finding you. Where do you want to put other people in the formation so you can maximize information sharing and sensor coverage and sensor footprints? It’s really no different, from a philosophical viewpoint, from what we’ve always done. We spend a lot of time trying to figure out what our weaknesses are: What do I need to fix as a pilot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an F-22 and F-35, one of the most enjoyable things is being virtually undetectable until it’s way, way, way too late for the threat. If you manage the signature really well, and you do it in a way that is integrated with the other platforms, most of the time the threat doesn’t know you’re there. And that’s why I have extreme faith that the machine is going to be the most dominant aircraft ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;The F-35C Navy variant has a larger wing than the Air Force and Marine models, folding wingtips, and more robust landing gear—all required for carrier operations. These two C models fly with Strike Fighter Squadron 147 at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/kh0NtGglJvfv1o28VYqhvqwxQcI=/1024x596/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/a0/b0/a0b0e1aa-30cf-4e60-a78e-274fac14d7ed/08m_am2019_b_20181116-n-fc670-001405_live.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The F-35C Navy variant has a larger wing than the Air Force and Marine models, folding wingtips, and more robust landing gear—all required for carrier operations.

&lt;h3&gt;Lieutenant JG Thorys Stensrud | U.S. Navy Strike Fighter Squadron 125&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stensrud graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2015, and trained in T-6s and T-45s. Last year he joined VF-125, NAS Lemoore, California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first flight was July 2018. It was surreal. I don’t think it really hit me until after we landed—just how impressive the jet is and how big a step it is from a T-45 to the first gray, Navy jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely was a challenge to learn, and I don’t think anyone’s going to be crushing it right off the bat. The basic skills come pretty quickly, in two or three flights. The most challenging part is how much information the jet presents to you and focusing on the right things at the right time. Over time, you kind of find the best way to process the information. I can’t think of another experience I’ve had that’s quite like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some people brought some skills from video games that might have helped them out, but probably not too much. I played some video games growing up, and I don’t find comparability between playing video games and flying the F-35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My training class was the first to have the opportunity to go straight to the F-35. I hope that we can live up to the expectation and add to the corporate knowledge around the jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Colonel Arthur “Turbo” Tomassetti | USMC (ret.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only government test pilot to fly all three variants of the X-35 aircraft, Tomassetti is the F-35 Marine Corps program manager at Lockheed Martin. He was the first pilot to fly the X-35 in three regimes on a single sortie: short takeoff, supersonic dash, and vertical landing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;Former test pilot Art Tomassetti estimates that he spent as many as 200 hours in the simulator to prepare for some of his one-hour test flights.&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/lHmPnacVANDt8tcdLSMSxWUOBYc=/1024x596/filters:focal(723x673:724x674)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/51/32/51327b7b-94d9-4ca6-a197-812cd4fd2a48/08k_am2019_f35_pilot_tomassetti_live.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Former test pilot Art Tomassetti estimates that he spent as many as 200 hours in the simulator to prepare for some of his one-hour test flights.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Former test pilot Art Tomassetti estimates that he spent as many as 200 hours in the simulator to prepare for some of his one-hour test flights. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(GySgt Stacey-Ann Viner / USMC)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three variants have the same specified top speed—Mach 1.6. Because they’re slightly different airplanes, some may get to it a little faster than others. Obviously, with the big wing on the F-35C, you’ve got to drive that a little bit harder to get to 1.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[When you cross the Mach threshold], you can notice it only if you’re paying attention to it. There is a little bit of a shudder, or vibration. If you were distracted or busy with something else, you might miss it. [On the mission that first combined short takeoff, supersonic dash, and vertical landing in a single flight], I think I noticed the transition just because of the magnitude of the event. You know, “Here’s young Major Tomassetti, first job out of test pilot school, flying over the dry lakebed in Edwards getting ready to take this X-airplane supersonic” and you start to think, “Hey, Chuck Yeager did this. What did I do right in my life to deserve being in this particular position?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the marvels of this airplane is the digital flight control technology. You are telling the airplane to go up or down, speed up or slow down, go left or right. And the computers figure out what’s the best way to do that, and they’re going to move the flight controls to do it. And the interesting thing is, they may not do it the same way twice. So let’s say the airplane gets damaged, and one of the flight controls is no longer available. A legacy airplane would still try to use that surface because it doesn’t know any better. The F-35 digital flight control systems will say, “That surface isn’t doing much for me anymore, so I’m going to have to compensate by using some other things. Maybe I’ll have to move them a little bit more to get the same effect because the pilot still wants to turn left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every time I took somebody out for a first flight, when we came back—I was usually at plane side when they were coming down the ladder—I was waiting for the minute when they lifted their visor to see the expression on their face. And in every case, that expression was a smile. And when you ask people, “Do you feel like you need to practice landings?” they say, “No, not really.” And that’s something that you did in all of your legacy airplanes. It’s not great empirical data, but it was enough to convince me that we had gotten to where I had hoped we would get to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Harrier, I needed to practice hover because hovering was hard, especially if it was windy out. In this airplane, hovering is so easy that there have been pictures of pilots with their hands above the canopy rails showing, “Look, no hands” because once you put it where you want, it’s going to stay there until you tell it to move or it runs out of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Major Valerie “Twitch” Wetzbarger | F-35 instructor pilot, USAF 56th Fighter Wing, Luke Air Force Base&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wetzbarger flew the F-15E Strike Eagle for six years before transitioning to the F-35A. Before joining the 56th Fighter Wing, Wetzbarger flew F-15Es with the 492nd Fighter Squadron, RAF Lakenheath, U.K., and the 391st Fighter Squadron, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. She deployed twice to the Middle East from 2014 to 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from a 4th-gen fighter to a 5th-gen fighter was like learning how to drive an automatic car from a manual. My dad was an F-4 pilot, and he always told me, “A jet’s a jet’s a jet, so don’t be intimidated by switching from one jet to another.” The F-35 actually handles a lot like the F-15E, with the difference being, the F-35 is a high angle-of-attack fighter with advanced control logic. [Angle of attack is the angle between the wing and the oncoming air.] Those of us not used to low speed, high-AOA performance from our previous aircraft must practice and adapt to those flight regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary mission of the F-35 is suppression of enemy air defenses. The training missions that maximize our learning are when we can locate surface-to-air missiles, protect the other strikers in the formation, bomb or suppress the targets we’ve been assigned, and then fight our way out. That mission is very similar to the F-15E, but the information fusion, pilot interface, and physical capabilities in the F-35 take our efficiency across the formation and among partner nations to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly learning as new capabilities present themselves and the tactics are upgraded, adapted, and changed every six months or so. Every time I teach a new mission set, I have to refresh my knowledge with the latest tactics and guidance. Keeping current and absorbing each other’s lessons is what it takes to be proficient as a fighter pilot in any community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Luke Air Force Base, we fly fairly complex missions while developing the mindset, “every wingman is a flight lead.” To execute effectively, we break down those missions into phases. Some of my favorite advice is, “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.” This means slow down, do your part right the first time, and that will be quicker in the end. In the cockpit, it’s important to prioritize, execute efficiently, and move on to the next priority. That is your contribution to the overall team effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband and I both learned the F-35 at the same time, and with great experiences behind us we were ready to learn a new jet and discover how we could contribute to this new melting-pot community of fighter experience. I appreciate the Air Force leaders supporting us living together as a family and the squadron treating us as individual pilots. I have also enjoyed seeing more females in fighter cockpits as they realize that the fighter community supports them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F-35 enables the U.S. Air Force to be a more integrated force. For example, in my squadron, Americans, Italians, and Norwegians work together and teach each other. Flying the same jet builds a stronger joint and coalition team and makes us more capable as a NATO unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jon Beesley | Lockheed F-35 Chief Test Pilot, 2002–2011&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With more than 23 years as a Lockheed Martin test pilot, Beesley worked on the development of the F-117 Nighthawk and F-22 Raptor, as well as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. On December 15, 2006, Beesley took the first F-35 prototype, designated AA-1, on its first flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For four years leading up to first flight, I spent a lot of time working on the STOVL Weight Attack Team, or SWAT. [Formed in April 2004, SWAT cut 2,700 pounds from the F-35B in six months.] That effort let us go in and fix quite a few things. There was at first a zealousness about commonality [among variants], and that’s very important to the airplane, but you don’t have to make bulkheads common to all variants. Nobody’s gonna pull into an Air Force or Marine Corps base and say, “I need a new bulkhead.” They’re gonna come in and say, “I got this bad mission system box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, if you’re getting a bunch of weight out, you’d really cripple the airplane, but in fact, all the variants became better. It was really kind of a magical moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AA-1, the very first airplane, was built prior to SWAT to the original specifications. To decide how the airplane ought to fly, we did hundreds of simulations before the first flight. When we flew the first flight, we were flying an engine that had never flown before, and we were doing it in a single-engine airplane. We were also flying electrohydrostatic actuators. Lightning is a beautiful name for the airplane, because everything is electric, including the actuators. The fact that all of that stuff worked so well on the first flight was just thrilling to me because we didn’t anticipate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago Jack Krings [test pilot and First Undersecretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan], made a statement that always stuck with me. He said, “Air combat has always been about stealth.” If you look back even into World War I, pilots attacked out of the sun. Why? Well, they didn’t want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the F-117 look the way it does? Flat plates and simple shapes. Why do the F-22 and the F-35 look the way they do? You can almost see the evolution of computers. With the computers available in the late 1970s, the prediction of radar cross-section—how an airplane would reflect radar—was obviously a challenge. With 1970s computers, you design very simple surfaces, which tend to be flat. Just think how your personal computer improved between the 1970s and the 1990s and 2000s. By that time, we were able to predict the radar effects from curved surfaces and much more complex shapes. When you can allow the airplanes to look more like airplanes, you gain performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the F-35, they used the Navy approach [to test maneuvers at high angle of attack]. That was to go up, disable all the limitations in the flight control system for an instant, get the airplane wrapped up, and then re-engage the whole flight control system to show that it would recover itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the part of the airplane that people don’t understand. The F-35 is as maneuverable as any other airplane, except perhaps the F-22. Russian airplanes are also very maneuverable, but if you dig into [the Russian demonstrations of maneuverability], what you’re seeing is the capabilities of airplanes flown by exceptional pilots. What we were building with the F-35 is an airplane that everybody can fly. That’s the critical part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Squadron Leader Andy Edgell | Royal Air Force, F-35 Patuxent River Integrated Test Force&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, Edgell flew as lead test pilot for the first F-35 flight trials on the aircraft carrier HMS&lt;/em&gt; Queen Elizabeth&lt;em&gt;, including executing an unprecedented aft-facing landing. Previously a Harrier pilot, Edgell embarked in HMS&lt;/em&gt; Ark Royal &lt;em&gt;and HMS&lt;/em&gt; Illustrious &lt;em&gt;and led over 70 combat operations in support of British operations in Afghanistan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people want me to make the comparison between the Harrier and the F-35, but it is chalk and cheese. Whereas I don’t want fleet pilots to be thinking about how the F-35 is flying or responding, I’ll tell you that was pretty much all I was doing in the Harrier. I equate it to a unicycle. You have to continuously pedal; keep moving something, whether it’s your left hand, your right hand, your feet. F-35, you just sit there and go hands free and it will stay exactly where you’ve put it. Flying an F-35 to an aircraft carrier is an absolute pleasure, as opposed to a Harrier, which frankly can be borderline terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tests in departure resistance, we truly had to trick the system. We would disengage all the self-protect mechanisms to put it into an out-of-control regime. And then we would allow the controller to wake up. It would recognize the situation it was in, and then it would get itself out of the situation. Absolutely fascinating. It will null all of the pitch rates, yaw rates, and roll rates to the extent that you can get it out the attitude that you’ve got it into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to true departure resistance, we allowed the system to be 100 percent engaged, and we would [fly like] a very badly trained pilot. So everything that I have been taught not to do as a pilot since the age of—crikey, when did I first start flying? Maybe 13—I was being asked to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mach 1.2, I was asked to put in full left rudder, yank the stick into the back left corner, a couple of seconds later, reverse it over to the right-hand side, switch rudder pedals, and then push the stick all the way forward into the front left. No pilot in his right mind should ever be doing this. But it is the way we needed to get the data to ensure that this is a 100 percent robust aircraft. I distinctly remember one occurrence. I was full backstick [very nose high], and probably with a full left rudder-pedal input. And I was at about 5 1/2 or 6 G, at which point I needed to switch rudder pedals, but due to the G, I couldn’t lift my right leg up to reverse the rudder pedal! So I aborted the maneuver. The control room said, “Yeah, Test, you didn’t put the right rudder in.” I said, “Yeah, I know. I couldn’t lift my leg up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand why people think that because it is so heavily computerized, flying the F-35 can’t be fun. The F-35 absolutely is fun to fly! It’s exhilarating because there is so much power. I vividly remember a pull-out of a dive. It was about a 70-degree dive to get to the actual test point, at 5,000 feet. I recovered full backstick, a pull-out to 50-degree angle of attack, and I could not believe how quickly the aircraft turned the corner. I had probably been flying the aircraft for about three years at that point, but at that moment, it absolutely took my breath away. Legalized hooliganism! All in the pursuit of data and good test points, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aft-facing landing on an aircraft carrier is an example [of a situation] where things are not going to plan. The ship may be dead in the water and the wind down the deck exceeds the limits for a tailwind landing, and you need to reverse the direction of your approach. It seems like a stunt—some might say a little unnecessary. But if that is what you need to do to recover your multi-million-dollar aircraft, then that is what you need to do. So we were really evaluating the handling of the aircraft—the propulsion, performance—when the wind is coming off the stern of the aircraft carrier. And it is disappointingly very, very benign. You just modify your pattern. There is nothing cosmic about it. The aircraft doesn’t really care what direction the ship is pointing in. It just seems a little bit bizarre. I did, for a moment, stare through the windows of the bridge. And you think to yourself, “This is a view that no one really gets.” You are flying nearly 200 miles an hour at about 105 feet, just pointing directly at the bridge. It certainly got some attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Yosef Morris | USAF 4th Squadron Commander, 388th Fighter Wing, Hill Air Force Base&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2012, Morris transitioned to the F-35 from the F-16. He was part of the initial cadre that stood up the first F-35 squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, and he led the 4th Fighter Squadron in 2017 and 2019 Red Flag exercises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two years since [the 388th’s] last Red Flag exercise, the airplane itself has had some pretty significant advancements. A couple of months before the 2017 Red Flag, the Air Force declared that the squadron was what we call “initial operational capable.” So the jet still had some operating limitations—altitude, airspeed, Gs, things like that. The software on the aircraft, though very capable, still had some limitations in terms of some of the systems and some of the weapons it could control. Fast forward two years, and we’re operating with what’s referred to as full warfighting capability software. It’s a more advanced F-35 than it was two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In the mission to suppress enemy air defenses,] we’re trying to prevent surface-to-air missiles from targeting other aircraft that are trying to get to different objectives. The F-35 has some really good sensors that can help us locate those threats. That’s a very satisfying mission to be able to target something that’s trying to shoot at you, especially when [you’re] helping out some other assets to get to a target and keeping them safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jet is sort of like a big antenna. It is receiving emissions from things that are radiating. And sometimes the [F-35’s] radar is actively trying to get information on, for example, an adversary aircraft. We can mission-plan the sensors, depending on the type of mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a large-force environment like Red Flag, where there might be as many as 60 or 70 aircraft on the Blue side and 10 or 20 adversary aircraft, lots of things on the ground—that’s a lot of information to interpret. Reading the first sortie on the first day, I certainly felt overwhelmed with the amount of information. And the next sortie I flew, I could manage some of my sensors differently to give me just the information I needed for that particular mission. Figuring out how to declutter your display to match the scenario is one of the main skills we learn here that we can’t simulate in day-to-day training, because you don’t get to train with the rest of the Department of Defense on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
