<title>I&amp;#039;m going to work full-time on free software</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry for posting two articles so close to each other - but this is important! As I’m certain many of you know, I maintain a large collection of free software projects, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/sway&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots&quot;&gt;wlroots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sr.ht&quot;&gt;sr.ht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc&quot;&gt;scdoc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc2&quot;&gt;aerc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddevault&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; more. I contribute to more still, working on projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpinelinux.org&quot;&gt;Alpine Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh&quot;&gt;mrsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://musl-libc.org&quot;&gt;musl libc&lt;/a&gt;, and anything else I can. Until now, I’ve been working on these in my spare time, but just under a year ago I wrote “&lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/24/The-road-to-sustainable-FOSS.html&quot;&gt;The path to sustainably working on FOSS full-time&lt;/a&gt;” laying out my future plans. Today I’m proud to tell you that, thanks to everyone’s support, I’ll be working on free software full-time starting in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited! I owe many people a great deal of thanks. To everyone who has donated to my fosspay, Patreon, and LiberaPay accounts: thank you. To all of the sr.ht users who chose to pay for their account despite it being an alpha: thank you. I also owe a thanks to all of the amazing contributors who give their spare time towards making the projects I maintain even better, without whom my software wouldn’t be anywhere near as useful to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to make grandiose promises right away, but I’m confident that increasing my commitment to open source to this degree is going to have a major impact on my projects. For now, my primary focus is sr.ht: its paid users make up the majority of the funding. Relatedly, I plan to invest more time in Alpine Linux on RISC-V and making RISC-V builds available to the sr.ht community. Sway and wlroots are in good shape as we quickly approach sway 1.0, and for this reason I want to give a higher priority to my smaller, more neglected projects like aerc for the time being. As I learn more about my bandwidth under these new conditions, I’ll expand my plans accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to clarify that despite choosing to work full-time on these projects, my income is going to be negative for a while. I have enough savings and income now that I feel comfortable making the leap, and I plan on working my ass off before my runway ends to earn the additional subscriptions to sr.ht and donations to fosspay et al that will make this decision sustainable in the long term. If that doesn’t happen before I get near the end of my runway, I’ll have to start looking for different work again. I’m depending on your continued support. If you appreciate my work but haven’t yet, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.sr.ht/billing/initial&quot;&gt;buying a subscription to sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://drewdevault.com/donate&quot;&gt;donating to my general projects fund&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, words cannot describe how excited I am. It’s been my dream for years to work on these projects full-time. Hitting this critical threshold of funding allows me to tremendously accelerate the progress of these projects. If you were impressed by what I built in my spare time, just wait until you see what we can accomplish now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/YsHI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: I’ll see you at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;! Ask me for a sticker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For more than two months after employees at






            &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/IBM&quot;&gt;International Business Machines&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.&lt;/span&gt;


      moved into a Manhattan building managed by office space giant WeWork Cos., frequent elevator problems forced workers to climb the stairs of the 11-story building and prompted complaints to the company.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the landlords behind the building was no ordinary owner: It was Adam Neumann,  WeWork’s chief executive, who leased the property to WeWork after buying it, according to people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Neumann has made millions of dollars by leasing multiple properties in which he has an ownership stake back to WeWork, one of the country’s most valuable startups. Multiple investors of the privately held company said the arrangement concerned them as a potential conflict of interest in which the CEO could benefit on rents or other terms with the company. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;A WeWork spokesman said all related-party deals are reviewed and approved by the board or an independent committee and disclosed to investors. Mr. Neumann declined to comment through a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;WeWork, which was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-raises-additional-capital-from-softbank-11546967337?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;valued at $47 billion&lt;/a&gt; by investor






            &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/JP/XTKS/9984&quot;&gt;SoftBank Group&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.&lt;/span&gt;


      , signs long-term leases for office space with landlords, then subleases the space on a short-term basis to companies. Mr. Neumann, the 39-year-old executive who founded WeWork in 2010, is WeWork’s largest individual shareholder and has voting control over the company. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In at least one instance before he secured full control over the company, Mr. Neumann wasn’t able to complete a similar deal. When WeWork was negotiating a lease on a Chicago building in 2013, he tried to buy a stake of up to 5% in the building—210-220 N. Green St.—as part of the deal, people familiar with the negotiation said. WeWork’s board raised concerns about the deal, citing a potential conflict of interest, and WeWork paid for the stake instead, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The next year, Mr. Neumann effectively gained control over the company. As part of an investment round for WeWork in 2014, he was granted Class B shares that gave him 10 votes per share, and now he has more than 65% of the overall share vote, according to WeWork corporate filings.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Neumann has since bought up several properties through investor groups and leased some of them to WeWork. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In a prospectus related to a debt offering last year, WeWork said it had leases with multiple properties owned in part by Mr. Neumann. It also said WeWork paid more than $12 million in rent to buildings “partially owned by officers” of WeWork between 2016 and 2017, and future payments total more than $110 million over the life of the leases. The specific properties weren’t listed. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In addition to the IBM building at 88 University Place, in which Mr. Neumann owns a 50% stake, he has invested in properties in San Jose, Calif., where WeWork is the tenant or expected to lease in the future, multiple people familiar with the deals said. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;There, he is a main investor in a group that has been buying up numerous properties in the downtown over the past year-and-a-half, including a 14-story tower built for the Bank of Italy in 1925, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Neumann’s plan is for the San Jose portfolio to host an urban campus of sorts—full of WeWork offices and related properties, including a residential building called WeLive, these people said. The developments would require some new construction, and WeWork has tapped famed architect Bjarke Ingels to design a master plan, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt; Otto Lee,  an intellectual property lawyer who sold his offices in the Bank of Italy building to the investor group, said he wasn’t aware Mr. Neumann was one of the buyers. “They have been quite tight-lipped about exactly who the people funding it are,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Another of the San Jose properties, St. James Plaza, which the group bought for $40 million in the summer, has signed a lease with WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;Corporate governance experts say Mr. Neumann’s ownership of buildings he leases to WeWork is unusual for a large company. Corporations typically bar executives from similar arrangements, given that companies risk paying too much in rent or leasing buildings they ordinarily wouldn’t, they said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“In a public company, that would be considered highly controversial,” said Charles Elson,  director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “Usually human beings tend to think of themselves over the company itself when they’re on the other side of the transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In New York, the deal at 88 University came together in 2015 after Mr. Neumann partnered with fashion designer Elie Tahari to buy the building for $70 million. The pair planned a renovation that included an overhaul of at least one of the elevators, said a person involved with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The owners subleased the building to WeWork. In turn, WeWork struck a deal with IBM, which needed space quickly and moved there in spring 2017. Mr. Neumann’s interest in the building was revealed last year by real-estate publication the Real Deal.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Soon after IBM arrived, one of the two elevators was out while the other was frequently breaking, causing lengthy waits and long slogs up the building’s narrow stairs. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;IBM executives, frustrated about their working conditions, complained to WeWork about the broken elevators, said people familiar with the matter. While landlords typically are responsible for elevators, WeWork had signed a so-called triple-net lease with Messrs. Tahari and Neumann, in which WeWork was responsible for fixing issues like elevators. As part of that deal, the landlord set aside funds to WeWork to pay for such renovations, a WeWork spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The building’s value, meanwhile, has gone up, and the owners have been able to borrow more money by refinancing the property’s debt. Late last year, Messrs. Neumann and Tahari took out a $77.5 million loan, according to loan adviser Meridian Capital Group, $7.5 million more than the prior loan to buy the building.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Neumann owes his personal wealth largely to sales of WeWork stock. It is unclear how much WeWork stock he has sold, but he has told some friends it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>After GDPR, The New York Times cut off ad exchanges and kept growing ad revenue</title>
<link>https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/winners-losers-gdpr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; arrived last year, The New York Times didn’t take any chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publisher blocked all open-exchange ad buying on its European pages, followed swiftly by behavioral targeting. Instead, NYT International focused on contextual and geographical targeting for programmatic guaranteed and private marketplace deals and has not seen ad revenues drop as a result, according to Jean-Christophe Demarta, svp for global advertising at New York Times International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, all the ads running on European pages are direct-sold. Although the publisher doesn’t break out exact revenues for Europe, Demarta said that digital advertising revenue has increased significantly since last May and that has continued into early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we are no longer offering behavioral targeting options in Europe does not seem to be in the way of what advertisers want to do with us,” he said. “The desirability of a brand may be stronger than the targeting capabilities. We have not been impacted from a revenue standpoint, and, on the contrary, our digital advertising business continues to grow nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT briefly tested reintroducing open-exchange programmatic ad buying last fall but didn’t pursue it. “When we weighed all considerations, it was decided not to continue with it,” added Demarta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last-minute scramble to prepare for GDPR’s arrival last May, led to some U.S. publishers taking a more extreme approach and either blocking pages entirely in Europe or pulling advertising altogether. USA Today pulled all advertising in Europe — a strategy it still sticks to. In total, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/impact-gdpr-5-charts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1,000 U.S. websites blocked access &lt;/a&gt;in Europe last May — &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/extremist-approach-gdpr-us-publishers-consider-blocking-european-visitors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an extreme but understandable response&lt;/a&gt; given the eye-watering GDPR penalties that can be levied should they get it wrong. Los Angeles Times has started making some of its content available in certain countries like the U.K. and France, though still carries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/latimes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a notice&lt;/a&gt; on its site warning that it is unavailable in most European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That more extreme approach may fly for U.S. publishers whose European revenue and traffic is negligible compared to the overall business. However, for publishers with meaningful revenue coming from Europe, that approach is unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times has 2.9 million paying digital subscribers globally, and 15 percent of the publisher’s digital news subscribers are from Europe. Digital advertising in Europe also remains an important revenue stream for the publisher. The publisher’s reader-revenue business model means it fiercely guards its readers’ user experience. Rather than bombard readers with consent notices or risk a clunky consent user experience, it decided to drop behavioral advertising entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribe for an exclusive, inside look at what’s actually happening in the video industry delivered to your inbox weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Insider also didn’t want to cut off a healthy European ad revenue stream. The publisher still runs personalized ads in Europe but only to those who have given consent for their data to be used for such purposes. Opt-in rates are high, so ad revenues haven’t been affected, according to Marc Boswell, global svp of revenue, operations and client services at Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BI’s European ad revenue accounts for approximately 10 percent of its total ad revenue, a large enough slice to ensure blocking advertising was never an option, added Boswell. The publisher started preparing for GDPR in January 2018, and used &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/axel-springer-counters-google-consent-management-tool/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Axel Springer’s open-source CMP&lt;/a&gt; from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have developed a more sophisticated approach to GDPR, rather than a more blunt tactic of blocking all visitors from Europe, will be in a stronger a position for the arrival of pending U.S privacy laws, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/wtf-california-consumer-privacy-act/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;, experts believe. “GDPR is just the beginning,” said Brian Kane, chief operations officer and co-founder of Sourcepoint. “Whether it is CCPA or other state-based regulation in the U.S. or [data privacy] trends in other countries like Canada and Japan, publishers will be prompted to lean in. They can no longer afford to view it as ‘well, it’s only a small percentage of my traffic being affected’ — publishers will have to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scramble that led to the arrival of GDPR last May &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/marketing/california-privacy-law-industry-tries-avoid-repeat-gdpr-scramble/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;isn’t likely to be repeated&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to preparing for the U.S. laws, according to industry executives. The CCPA doesn’t kick in until 2020, but three U.S. media conglomerates are already actively seeking &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-curious-wtf-cmp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;consent-management platform&lt;/a&gt; partners, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. CMPs store the information on which users have given consent to be tracked and served personalized ads, and pass that information back to all the publisher’s programmatic advertising partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing renewed interest from large U.S. publishers in revising their consent strategies,” said Kane. “Similar to what we saw in the U.K., there are many publishers who had a ‘day one’ solution for GDPR and are now wanting to run more robust processes for the long term, both for GDPR as well as the U.S. privacy laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the U.K. regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, has favored the carrot to the stick, particularly when it comes to leveraging its jurisdiction with U.S. publishers. The Washington Post went its own route and developed a paid subscription offer for those who don’t want to give consent to be tracked. The publisher &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-regulators-mixed-signals-industry-confusion/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;received a mild wrist slap from the ICO&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a warning letter, but the regulator isn’t likely to enforce the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’d asked me a year and a half ago if I was concerned about the California privacy law, I’d have said yes, very,” said Boswell. “But since we have gone through GDPR, that’s no longer the case. There are minor differences between the policies, but we will likely apply a modified version of the same framework.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The curious case of the Raspberry Pi in the network closet</title>
<link>https://blog.haschek.at/2018/the-curious-case-of-the-RasPi-in-our-network.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.haschek.at/2018/the-curious-case-of-the-RasPi-in-our-network.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I got a message from a co-worker with an image attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pictshare.net/hdkhikv83m.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;Message from my co-worker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him to unplug it, store it in a safe location, take photos of all parts and to make an image from the SD card (since I mostly work remote). I have worked on many Raspberry Pi projects and I felt confident I could find out what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point nobody thought it was going to be malicious, more like one of our staffers was playing around with something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 3 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Raspberry Pi b first generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mysterious USB dongle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 16GB sd card (a fast one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pictshare.net/gfss00puet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;USB dongle and SD card&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people who can access this small cabinet is very limited. Only 4 people have a key for this room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The groundskeeper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My co-worker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them knew anything about this so I asked my IT colleagues and they were as baffled as I was. I heard of people getting paid to put things like this in places they shouldn't and for this reason I was very interested in finding out what it actually does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me solve this mistery &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9xveq5/rogue_raspberrypi_found_in_network_closet_need/&quot;&gt;I asked reddit&lt;/a&gt; and surely enough they identified the dongle as a microprocessor, almost as powerful as the Rasberry Pi itself: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52832-mdk/&quot;&gt;nRF52832-MDK&lt;/a&gt;. A very powerful wifi, bluetooth and RFID reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pictshare.net/lrc3fnqrl7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;The nRF52832-MDK usb dongle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was - no doubt - to give the old Raspberry Pi a wifi and bluetooth connection. Great so now this thing has wifi too..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SD card has a few partitions. Most ext4 (linux) and one fat16 (boot)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pictshare.net/htpg3y9xhu.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;GParted view of the image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, time to mount it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My debian box told me the first big clue: It's a resin installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/wt9hqp.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;Resin partitions on the SD Card&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTF is Resin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balena.io/&quot;&gt;Resin (now renamed to Balena)&lt;/a&gt; is a paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena&quot;&gt;IOT web service&lt;/a&gt; where you can generate images for IOT devices, deploy those devices and get updates and data from and to resin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resin also installs a VPN on the device so the collected data is transferred securely. Obviously this device was meant to be picked up again since it leaves a trail as the service is a paid one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closer look at the partitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First partition is called &lt;strong&gt;&quot;resin-boot&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/n7rq00.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See something that catches your eye? We got a &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt;. Quick jackpot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/y9tq3d93ru.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;config.json on the resin-boot partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can extract from this file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The application deployed to this resin device is called &lt;strong&gt;&quot;logger&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a good sign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got a &lt;strong&gt;username&lt;/strong&gt;. This seems to be the username for the resin account associated with this device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirmation that the device used a &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; via Port 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A registration date. It was registered (or first deployed or set up?) on &lt;strong&gt;May 13th 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About that username..&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I googled the username found in the config.json file I found a person in the same town where this Pi was found. The company then checked their records for this person but found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough I found a website from 2001 where parents of &quot;gifted children&quot; write articles about them and for some reason sign those articles with their home address and phone numbers. So I have a name and the address of this whole family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pictshare.net/800/9drvd1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;Not the actual site but a similar one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a wrong lead as usernames tend to be used by multiple people but let's just keep that name in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;resin-data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data directory didn't have any data stored (as in: &lt;em&gt;collected data&lt;/em&gt;) but there was a nodejs app which was heavily obfuscated and to this day I can't tell exactly what it was doing. It seems to talk via a serial connection to the dongle but I can't extract what data is actually collected. I can only assume that it collected movement profiles of bluetooth and wifi devices in the area (around the Managers office) and maybe raw wifi packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found something much more interesting: a &lt;code&gt;LICENSE.md&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/7ora0e.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;Screenshot of the LICENSE.md file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odd.. Why would this nodejs app include a confidential piece of software? I googled the company from the copyright header and guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is beyond me why a co-founder of a company would distribute these devices around town but well..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting the attackers home address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very interesting thing I found was a file on the third partition (&lt;code&gt;resin-state&lt;/code&gt;) in the path &lt;code&gt;/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/&lt;/code&gt;. The file is called &lt;strong&gt;resin-wifi-01&lt;/strong&gt; and guess what it contains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/8vdh9k.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contains the wifi credentials to the wifi that was used to set the device up (or to test it). Definitely not the wifi of the company. And what do we do, when we want to find out a location associated with a wifi name? We go to wigle.net, enter the SSID (=wifi name) and it tells us where on the world it is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.pictshare.net/6ztf78.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;/&gt;not the actual name and not the actual location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? The address we found of that gifted persons parents? &lt;strong&gt;That's exactly where our Pi was set up&lt;/strong&gt; according to Wigle.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How and when did the Pi even get there?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the DNS logs and found the exact date and time when the Pi was first seen in the network. I checked the RADIUS logs to see which employee was at the premises at that time and I saw multiple error messages that a deactivated account tried to connect to wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deactivated accound belongs to an ex employee who (for some reason) made a deal with management that he could still have a key for a few months until he moved all his stuff out of the building (don't ask..).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal has taken over, I did my part and the rest is over my pay grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was a very interesting challenge and I'd like to thank every person on reddit who helped me with one piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No more XS4ALL is unthinkable</title>
<link>http://lgms.nl/blog-12-plain</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://lgms.nl/blog-12-plain</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://lgms.nl/&quot; class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Luc Gommans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;location&quot;&gt;/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://lgms.nl/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No more XS4ALL is unthinkable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Written on 2019-01-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are the example of how it should be, the Dutch ISP called XS4ALL. They were bought in '98 by the former state-owned KPN, but continued to operate independently. Born from a group of hackers and the first ISP in the Netherlands, today they are still the example that we measure other ISPs by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;paddme&quot; alt=&quot;XS4ALL logo&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/1/1d/20150323214911%21Xs4alllogo.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few days ago, KPN announced they were going to &quot;let go of the brand&quot;. It is not about the brand, of course. It is a euphemism which means XS4ALL will be shut down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of customers (and really, the Netherlands is not that large, neither is XS4ALL, and we don't usually support commercial companies out of the kindness of our hearts) signed a petition for XS4ALL to stay and many more took to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your ISP ever sued anyone for you?&lt;/strong&gt; XS4ALL &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweakers.net/nieuws/20902/xs4all-wint-rechtszaak-tegen-spammers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;successfully sued spammers&lt;/a&gt; to create case law for not having to deliver their messages and get damages from them. When Scientology sued them for not taking down a customer's free homepage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaak-Scientology_tegen_Karin_Spaink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;they resisted on the customer's behalf and won again&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/World_IPv6_launch_badge.svg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; alt=&quot;IPv6 Launch Day logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your ISP rolled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xs4all.nl/technologie.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IPv6 as early as 2010&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Do you get a /48 as per the standard, which contains more IPv6 addresses than there exist IPv4 addresses, or does your ISP give you /64 (a single subnet)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/The_Pirate_Bay_logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Pirate Bay logo&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;paddme&quot; width=&quot;130&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your ISP ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS4ALL#BREIN_en_XS4ALL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; ref=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;joined another ISP in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; because the Dutch MAFIAA (collective of movie and music rights holders called Stichting BREIN) sued them over blocking The Pirate Bay? BREIN sued Ziggo to force a block, since they were the largest ISP at the time and would set a good example. XS4ALL saw it as an attempt to censor the Internet (if you block one, where does it stop?) and went &quot;if you sue one, you will have to sue us all&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has your ISP helped in relief efforts&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS4ALL#Arab_Spring_in_Egypt_and_Libya&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; ref=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;providing dial-up numbers for people in Libya and Egypt when their governments censored their Internet&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XS4ALL is a commercial company. They never competed on price, but the price difference is not large. If you have a question about how DNS works, you can give them a call: not only has the support desk always been knowledgeable enough to tell you that, in 2010 they also started advertising that you could call their Internet Helpdesk ('Internet Vraagbaak') with any random technical question like &quot;how do I upload a video from my phone to YouTube?&quot; Their support is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mt.nl/management-team/xs4all/17183&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;widely known for being the best&lt;/a&gt;, their connections are known for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nedlinux.com/index.php?page=hosting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;good uptime&lt;/a&gt; (back when that was more uncommon in particular), and they earned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xs4all.nl/beste-internet-provider/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a lot of &quot;best ISP&quot; awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it a big deal that XS4ALL stops? Surely there are more? Well, not that I know of. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweak.nl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tweak&lt;/a&gt;, born from Tweakers.net (a locally extremely well-known tech forum and news site), has some similar ideals but is not on par technically (e.g. only offers IPv6 as a configurable tunnel) nor ideologically (no lawsuits or so that I know of). I lived in Belgium for a while, a country that still has data caps on landline connections, and moved to Germany last year. &lt;strong&gt;I have not been able to find an ISP even remotely equivalent across three countries.&lt;/strong&gt; I looked at local ones, expensive ones, business accounts, but nobody has a track record that comes even close. To complete their profile, let me throw in some more XS4ALL facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Internet_Archive_logo_and_wordmark.svg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;paddme&quot; width=&quot;130&quot; alt=&quot;Internet Archive logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;XS4ALL hosts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.xs4all.nl/327-miljard-webpaginas-wie-bewaart-het-internet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the European copy of the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; since 2004. When I was in their datacenter I saw the box (it has a nice Internet Archive label), but did not realize that it was a complete copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xs4all.nl/klant/servers.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;free ssh box&lt;/a&gt; (see 'shell server') for you to use with only a fair use policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the service center (a webinterface to manage your connection), they allow you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/29605199#29605199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;configure the reverse DNS record&lt;/a&gt; for your IP address. This is very handy for hosting mail servers, but also just generally neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Gqw3w9Hec5rlxzVRHlbJrw.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; alt=&quot;Open Source Software logo&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;paddme&quot;/&gt; They &lt;a href=&quot;https://roundcube.net/about/supporters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;contributed to open source software like Roundcube&lt;/a&gt; because they use it and wanted to share back. Not only with money, but also by contributing other resources and open source plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The router they ship costs &amp;gt;250 euros, but they charge you only 10 bucks shipping. It's not some locked down rebranded stuff like with most other ISPs, it's the real deal: your router, you configure it how you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what ISP gives you a symmetrical fiber connection, opens all ports even before net neutrality kind of required it (not blocking TCP port 25 for example), and tell you to do whatever you want? When I called them to ask if it's okay if I host a website on there, they were perfectly chill with it and gave me the go-ahead without hesitation, also if it would use a lot of the available bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr color=&quot;#ccc&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this goes through, it will be a loss not only for our connections, but also for their contributions to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, I was signing &lt;a href=&quot;https://xs4allmoetblijven.petities.nl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;that petition&lt;/a&gt; myself and scrolled down a little too far. Guess what petities.nl says in their footer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lgms.nl/files/sponsored-by-xs4all.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Banner saying 'sponsored by XS4ALL'&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Hosting sponsored by XS4ALL.&quot;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is the ISP I want to continue to support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Migrate Jest to TypeScript</title>
<link>https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/7554</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/7554</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me I see the sense in moving to reason or ocaml which are more safe languages than both flow and typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;user&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/hovercards?user_id=49038&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/orta&quot;&gt;@orta&lt;/a&gt; already answered here, but the tl;dr (at least to me) is that the point here is to make the code base more approachable to to new (and old) contributors who are consumers of Jest. The vast majority of them are JavaScript developers, not OCaml developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end of the day it's the same javascript full of its problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, but we love it nonetheless 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow has recently been putting lots of effort into rolling out support for Microsoft's Language Server Protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, but it's taken months and months, and it's still not done. The argument &quot;we'll be just as good, just a year later&quot; doesn't really spark much confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy to be convinced otherwise of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, FWIW I personally don't use VS Code, so LSP doesn't impact my experience. I use IntelliJ (WebStorm), and their TS support is miles ahead of the Flow support. I know most people do use VS Code nowadays though, so your point is very much valid to the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure I understand this point - what's the difference from Flow &amp;amp; flow-typed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to generate typings from source code in flow. They've had an untouched &lt;code&gt;gen-flow-files&lt;/code&gt; for some time, but it never went anywhere (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;300096687&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/5871&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;issue&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/facebook/flow/issues/5871/hovercard&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/5871&quot;&gt;facebook/flow#5871&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imo jumping between TS and Flow does not create much of a barrier for someone experienced with either. Like you say, the features and syntax are extremely similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, but the tooling is way better with typescript, even if the syntax itself is very similar. The fact flow is improving (lsp support has been worked on for a long time, generating types etc) doesn't mask the fact TS has all of that today, and there's no real reason to believe Flow will get those features in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow and Jest are both Facebook products (right?), so I assume (a) the barrier to entry for internal FB employees would be higher, and (b) if changes are needed upstream in the typechecker, the chances of that being prioritised are higher than with TS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't answer to a, but to b: not necessarily, this took 8 months &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;311728841&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6103&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;issue&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/facebook/flow/issues/6103/hovercard&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6103&quot;&gt;facebook/flow#6103&lt;/a&gt;, typescript had it within a few days &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;309968697&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/24624&quot; data-hovercard-type=&quot;pull_request&quot; data-hovercard-url=&quot;/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/24624/hovercard&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/24624&quot;&gt;DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#24624&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;m not convinced that this wasn&amp;#039;t the second biggest mistake of my life</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;cmhETbs&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;So this is what I'm working on. Top is the first screenshot I have of my project. Bottom is the most recent. Is this an advertisement for the video game I'm working on? Well, honestly, yeah, it kind of is. But I'm also scared and angry and I want to say a few things and I think I have a story you haven't heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;Ged5JEE&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is me. The year is 2011. I'm in South Asia. I had my resume declassified and I'm allowed to say that I worked for CIA from May 2008 through November 2016. If I ever say anything about my work, I have to get it approved beforehand. I haven't gotten anything approved especially for this post, so any specifics about my work, I'm just copying directly from what CIA has already approved in my resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;Bzdk2ik&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is me with the people in my office. We have US Army, US Navy, Canadian Army, and me. They worked in the Public Affairs Office. My job was a little bit different. At the time I was in what was then known as the Open Source Center. I've always been good with technology and in this assignment, among some other projects I was working on, &quot;I applied my insight and analytic rigor to create reports for the US foreign-affairs community. While serving in South Asia, I wrote a computer program that wrote reports automatically, showing ISAF regional command an at-a-glance depiction of the media environment, its top stories, and sentiment.&quot; The Navy guy on the other side of the Canadian girl, by the way, he's a big deal now. He's a politician in Ohio. And I heard he made lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;mOHssiA&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;So after kicking ass in South Asia, I was given my choice of follow-on assignments. I opted for some more language training before doing anything else. I speak Arabic, but after the assignment in South Asia, I was a little rusty and wanted a refresher. In 2012, my then-teenage little brother (I'm 16 years older than he is) was having a really tough time. My dad said my brother only wanted to play video games and he wasn't sure how to connect with him. The Oculus Rift was on Kickstarter at the time and I suggested building a computer, getting a Rift, and learning how to program video games. I thought it was a great idea and I backed the Rift so that I could guide my dad and brother on making a game together. Well, they never built that computer together. My dad never backed the Oculus Rift, and they never did develop a video game together. And my little brother has since then gone from one bad situation to another. And I had a Rift I wasn't sure what to do with. So I learned to use UDK, which was popular at the time, and was the predecessor to today's Unreal Engine 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;JgnEjUu&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I was finishing up my language training and applying for my next assignment. I got accepted into a very selective specialty. I became a &quot;technical intelligence officer&quot; and &quot;In the collection service, I programmed and installed equipment to collect data, which I filtered and searched in order to find information critical to security interests.&quot; I was honored. It was a huge deal to me. This was the kind of assignment I had joined CIA for. It was everything I had wanted. And if things hadn't gone horribly wrong, I would have been a lifer, doing that job until forced into retirement. Well, things did go horribly wrong. And I can't talk about it. I resigned. And before I left, I wrote a scathing report on everything that had gone wrong. I posted it on NSA's internal Parting Thoughts blog, which they allowed me to do as a courtesy to people departing from my specialty. Anyone interested in an infuriating tale of mismanagement, fraud, incompetence, duplicity, backstabbing, turf wars, and tyranny of petty authority, I encourage to send a Freedom of Information Act request to NSA. Ask for the post &quot;Beyond Mere Malice&quot; from the Parting Thoughts blog, November 2016. My friends tell me that the post has since been taken down, but it's not gone completely. It's just no longer viewable. NSA will dig it up and send you a declassified version if you request it. So I wrote that report and posted it to Parting Thoughts. Hundreds of people read it and no fewer than five of them forwarded it to my counterintelligence officer. He called me in for a chat. Counterintel sat me down and told me basically, &quot;This ends here. Anything you write from here on out, we have to approve. If you write a tell-all book without our permission, you go to prison. Any questions?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;83Oz7jN&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;So where does the video game come into the picture? So you see, I had this Oculus Rift development kit that I wasn't really going to use for anything specific. But I had learned to use UDK to make video games. While my career was falling apart, I decided to start making a video game. Normally I might have played a video game as a way to retreat from the world. But instead I channeled all of my anger, sadness, disappointment, and frustration into a project that became the video game you see above. I can't tell you the story of why I resigned from CIA. But I can tell you a story that captures the emotions I felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;hpdnKIh&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I can take some fictional people, make everyone betray them for all their own petty and cowardly reasons, and our protagonists will just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ORJ8luG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;So now I've resigned from a job I had grown to despise, and I'm channeling my frustration into something productive as a way of dealing with everything that had happened. Sounds like a good idea, right? Well, I'm not convinced this wasn't the second biggest mistake I ever made. I left a steady paycheck just at the time when management had all moved on. I left when my two years of most recent performance reviews were absolutely glowing, and they had bumped my history with the &quot;collection service&quot; off my internal job applications. I left when I once again was being offered the assignments I wanted. I left just when things were turning around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;NhtSztW&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;My wife says that I was miserable though. And I was making her miserable. And I know I wouldn't have been happy at CIA no matter what happened after that. Maybe that's my own fault, not being able to put the past in the past. My wife says that I've been happier after I quit, at least. And she has been happier too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;QrTMOm0&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;We've been living very frugally now for about two years without my income while I finish the game. It's playable now, through about 8 hours of content. It's going to be a lot longer than that before I'm finished. But it's time for me to start moving along, and I'm releasing the game as an Early Access title on Steam next month. I don't know how well the game is going to sell. I've started looking for my next grownup job after this, just assuming that I'm not going to retire and I'm not going to have a lifelong career in game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;H6fkeKk&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;30.924342105263&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta post-image-meta--last&quot; readability=&quot;11.824013157895&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Maybe this was all a big mistake. Maybe I should have just stayed at my job and kept game development as a hobby. I don't know. Whether the game sells well or is a complete flop, either way I think this will be the only game I ever develop. It'll be my way of closing this chapter of my life. For those of you have read this far, thank you for letting me tell you my story. If anyone is interested, the game is called Himeko Sutori. You can add it to your wishlist on Steam. I'm planning on releasing it as an Early Access title at the end of January. &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/669500/Himeko_Sutori&quot;&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/669500/Himeko_Sutori&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend a lot of time advising startups. Though one-on-one advice will always be crucial, we thought it might help us scale Y Combinator if we could distill the most generalizable parts of this advice into a sort of playbook we could give YC and YC Fellowship companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we thought we should just give it to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is meant for people new to the world of startups. Most of this will not be new to people who have read a lot of what YC partners have written—the goal is to get it into one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a part II on how to scale a startup later—this mostly covers how to start one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal as a startup is to make something users love. If you do that, then you have to figure out how to get a lot more users. But this first part is critical—think about the really successful companies of today. They all started with a product that their early users loved so much they told other people about it. If you fail to do this, you will fail. If you deceive yourself and think your users love your product when they don’t, you will still fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup graveyard is littered with people who thought they could skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much better to first make a product a small number of users love than a product that a large number of users like. Even though the total amount of positive feeling is the same, it’s much easier to get more users than to go from like to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of warning about choosing to start a startup: It sucks! One of the most consistent pieces of feedback we get from YC founders is it’s harder than they could have ever imagined, because they didn’t have a framework for the sort of work and intensity a startup entails. Joining an early-stage startup that’s on a rocketship trajectory is usually a much better financial deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, starting a startup is not in fact very risky to your career—if you’re really good at technology, there will be job opportunities if you fail. Most people are very bad at evaluating risk. I personally think the riskier option is having an idea or project you’re really passionate about and working at a safe, easy, unfulfilling job instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a successful startup, you need: a great idea (including a great market), a great team, a great product, and great execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bg-inside&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;

Table of Contents&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;162.02584396705&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we ask YC companies is what they’re building and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for clear, concise answers here. This is both to evaluate you as a founder and the idea itself. It’s important to be able to think and communicate clearly as a founder—you’ll need it for recruiting, raising money, selling, etc. Ideas in general need to be clear to spread, and complex ideas are almost always a sign of muddled thinking or a made up problem. If the idea does not really excite at least some people the first time they hear it, that’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing we ask is who desperately needs the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the best case, you yourself are the target user. In the second best case, you understand the target user extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company already has users, we ask how many and how fast that number is growing. We try to figure out why it’s not growing faster, and we especially try to figure out if users really love the product. Usually this means they’re telling their friends to use the product without prompting from the company. We also ask if the company is generating revenue, and if not, why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the company doesn’t yet have users, we try to figure out the minimum thing to build first to test the hypothesis—i.e., if we work backwards from the perfect experience, we try to figure out what kernel to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to test an idea is to either launch it and see what happens or try to sell it (e.g. try to get a letter of intent before you write a line of code.) The former works better for consumer ideas (users may tell you they will use it, but in practice it won’t cut through the clutter) and the latter works better for enterprise ideas (if a company tells you they will buy something, then go build it.) Specifically, if you are an enterprise company, one of the first questions we’ll ask you is if you have a letter of intent from a customer saying they’ll buy what you’re building. For most biotech and hard tech companies, the way to test an idea is to first talk to potential customers and then figure out the smallest subset of the technology you can build first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to let your idea evolve as you get feedback from users. And it’s critical you understand your users really well—you need this to evaluate an idea, build a great product, and build a great company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, startups are really hard. They take a very long time, and consistent intense effort. The founders and employees need to have a shared sense of mission to sustain them. So we ask why founders want to start this particular company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ask how the company will one day be a monopoly. There are a lot of different terms for this, but we use Peter Thiel’s. Obviously, we don’t want your company to behave in an unethical way against competitors. Instead, we’re looking for businesses that get more powerful with scale and that are difficult to copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we ask about the market. We ask how big it is today, how fast it’s growing, and why it’s going to be big in ten years. We try to understand why the market is going to grow quickly, and why it’s a good market for a startup to go after. We like it when major technological shifts are just starting that most people haven’t realized yet—big companies are bad at addressing those. And somewhat counterintuitively, the best answer is going after a large part of a small market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other thoughts on ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We greatly prefer something new to something derivative. Most really big companies start with something fundamentally new (one acceptable definition of new is 10x better.) If there are ten other companies starting at the same time with the same plan, and it sounds a whole lot like something that already exists, we are skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important counterintuitive reason for this is that it’s easier to do something new and hard than something derivative and easy. People will want to help you and join you if it’s the former; they will not if it’s the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best ideas sound bad but are in fact good. So you don’t need to be too secretive with your idea—if it’s actually a good idea, it likely won’t sound like it’s worth stealing. Even if it does sound like it’s worth stealing, there are at least a thousand times more people that have good ideas than people who are willing to do the kind of work it takes to turn a great idea into a great company. And if you tell people what you’re doing, they might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of telling people your idea—while it’s important the idea really excites some people the first time they hear it, almost everyone is going to tell you that your idea sucks. Maybe they are right. Maybe they are not good at evaluating startups, or maybe they are just jealous. Whatever the reason is, it will happen a lot, it will hurt, and even if you think you’re not going to be affected by it, you still will be. The faster you can develop self-belief and not get dragged down too much by haters, the better off you’ll be. No matter how successful you are, the haters will never go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don’t have an idea but want to start a startup? Maybe you shouldn’t. It’s so much better if the idea comes first and the startup is the way to get the idea out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We once tried an experiment where we funded a bunch of promising founding teams with no ideas in the hopes they would land on a promising idea after we funded them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them failed. I think part of the problem is that good founders tend to have lots of good ideas (too many, usually). But an even bigger problem is that once you have a startup you have to hurry to come up with an idea, and because it’s already an official company the idea can’t be too crazy. You end up with plausible sounding but derivative ideas. This is the danger of pivots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s better not to try too actively to force yourself to come up with startup ideas. Instead, learn about a lot of different things. Practice noticing problems, things that seem inefficient, and major technological shifts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.samaltman.com/projects-and-companies&quot;&gt;Work on projects you find interesting&lt;/a&gt;. Go out of your way to hang around smart, interesting people. At some point, ideas will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;96&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediocre teams do not build great companies. One of the things we look at the most is the strength of the founders. When I used to do later-stage investing, I looked equally hard at the strength of the employees the founders hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a great founder? The most important characteristics are ones like unstoppability, determination, formidability, and resourcefulness. Intelligence and passion also rank very highly. These are all much more important than experience and certainly “expertise with language X and framework Y”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have noticed the most successful founders are the sort of people who are low-stress to work with because you feel “he or she will get it done, no matter what it is.” Sometimes you can succeed through sheer force of will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good founders have a number of seemingly contradictory traits. One important example is rigidity and flexibility. You want to have strong beliefs about the core of the company and its mission, but still be very flexible and willing to learn new things when it comes to almost everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best founders are unusually responsive. This is an indicator of decisiveness, focus, intensity, and the ability to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders that are hard to talk to are almost always bad. Communication is a very important skill for founders—in fact, I think this is the most important rarely-discussed founder skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech startups need at least one founder who can build the company’s product or service, and at least one founder who is (or can become) good at sales and talking to users. This can be the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these criteria when you’re choosing a cofounder -- it’s one of the most important decisions you’ll make, and it’s often done fairly randomly. You want someone you know well, not someone you just met at a cofounder dating thing. You can evaluate anyone you might work with better with more data, and you really don’t want to get this one wrong. Also, at some point, the expected value of the startup is likely to dip below the X axis. If you have a pre-existing relationship with your cofounders, none of you will want to let the other down and you’ll keep going. Cofounder breakups are one of the leading causes of death for early startups, and we see them happen very, very frequently in cases where the founders met for the express purpose of starting the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best case, by far, is to have a good cofounder. The next best is to be a solo founder. The worse case, by far, is to have a bad cofounder. If things are not working out, you should part ways quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note on equity: the conversation about the equity split does not get easier with time—it’s better to set it early on. Nearly equal is best, though perhaps in the case of two founders it’s best to have one person with one extra share to prevent deadlocks when the cofounders have a fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;123&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the secret to success: have a great product. This is the only thing all great companies have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not build a product users love you will eventually fail. Yet founders always look for some other trick. Startups are the point in your life when tricks stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great product is the only way to grow long-term. Eventually your company will get so big that all growth hacks stop working and you have to grow by people wanting to use your product. This is the most important thing to understand about super-successful companies. There is no other way. Think about all of the really successful technology companies—they all do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to build a “product improvement engine” in your company. You should talk to your users and watch them use your product, figure out what parts are sub-par, and then make your product better. Then do it again. This cycle should be the number one focus of the company, and it should drive everything else. If you improve your product 5% every week, it will really compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster the repeat rate of this cycle, the better the company usually turns out. During YC, we tell founders they should be building product and talking to users, and not much else besides eating, sleeping, exercising, and spending time with their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this cycle right, you have to get very close to your users. Literally watch them use your product. Sit in their office if you can. Value both what they tell you and what they actually do. You should not put anyone between the founders and the users for as long as possible—that means the founders need to do sales, customer support, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand your users as well as you possibly can. Really figure out what they need, where to find them, and what makes them tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do things that don’t scale” has rightfully become a mantra for startups. You usually need to recruit initial users one at a time (Ben Silbermann used to approach strangers in coffee shops in Palo Alto and ask them to try Pinterest) and then build things they ask for. Many founders hate this part, and just want to announce their product in the press. But that almost never works. Recruit users manually, and make the product so good the users you recruit tell their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need to break things into very small pieces, and iterate and adapt as you go. Don’t try to plan too far out, and definitely don’t batch everything into one big public release. You want to start with something very simple—as little surface area as possible—and launch it sooner than you’d think. In fact, simplicity is always good, and you should always keep your product and company as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common questions we ask startups having problems: Are users using your product more than once? Are your users fanatical about your product? Would your users be truly bummed if your company went away? Are your users recommending you to other people without you asking them to do it? If you’re a B2B company, do you have at least 10 paying customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, then that’s often the underlying problem, and we tell companies to make their product better. I am skeptical about most excuses for why a company isn’t growing—very often the real reason is that the product just isn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When startups aren’t sure what to do next with their product, or if their product isn’t good enough, we send them to go talk to their users. This doesn’t work in every case—it’s definitely true that people would have asked Ford for faster horses—but it works surprisingly often. In fact, more generally, when there’s a disagreement about anything in the company, talk to your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best founders seem to care a little bit too much about product quality, even for seemingly unimportant details. But it seems to work. By the way, “product” includes all interactions a user has with the company. You need to offer great support, great sales interactions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you haven’t made a great product, nothing else will save you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s necessary to build a great product, you’re not done after that. You still have to turn it into a great company, and you have to do it yourself—the fantasy of hiring an “experienced manager” to do all this work is both extremely prevalent and a graveyard for failed companies. You cannot outsource the work to someone else for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds obvious, but you have to make money. This would be a good time to start thinking about how that’s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only universal job description of a CEO is to make sure the company wins. You can do this as the founder even if you have a lot of flaws that would normally disqualify you as a CEO as long as you hire people that complement your own skills and let them do their jobs. That experienced CEO with a fancy MBA may not have the skill gaps you have, but he or she won’t understand the users as well, won’t have the same product instincts, and won’t care as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth and momentum are the keys to great execution. Growth (as long as it is not “sell dollar bills for 90 cents” growth) solves all problems, and lack of growth is not solvable by anything but growth. If you’re growing, it feels like you’re winning, and people are happy. If you’re growing, there are new roles and responsibilities all the time, and people feel like their careers are advancing. If you’re not growing, it feels like you’re losing, and people are unhappy and leave. If you’re not growing, people just fight over responsibilities and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders and employees that are burn out nearly always work at startups without momentum. It’s hard to overstate how demoralizing it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime directive of great execution is “Never lose momentum”. But how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important way is to make it your top priority. The company does what the CEO measures. It’s valuable to have a single metric that the company optimizes, and it’s worth time to figure out the right growth metric. If you care about growth, and you set the execution bar, the rest of the company will focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of Airbnb drew a forward-looking graph of the growth they wanted to hit. They posted this everywhere—on their fridge, above their desks, on their bathroom mirror. If they hit the number that week, great. If not, it was all they talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg once said that one of the most important innovations at Facebook was their establishment of a growth group when growth slowed. This group was (and perhaps still is) one of the most prestigious groups in the company—everyone knew how important it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep a list of what’s blocking growth. Talk as a company about how you could grow faster. If you know what the limiters are, you’ll naturally think about how to address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything you consider doing, ask yourself “Is this the best way to optimize growth?” For example, going to a conference is not usually the best way to optimize growth, unless you expect to sell a lot there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme internal transparency around metrics (and financials) is a good thing to do. For some reason, founders are always really scared of this. But it’s great for keeping the whole company focused on growth. There seems to be a direct correlation between how focused on metrics employees at a company are and how well they’re doing. If you hide the metrics, it’s hard for people to focus on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of metrics, don’t fool yourself with vanity metrics. The common mistake here is to focus on signups and ignore retention. But retention is as important to growth as new user acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to establish an internal cadence to keep momentum. You want to have a “drumbeat” of progress—new features, customers, hires, revenue milestones, partnerships, etc that you can talk about internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should set aggressive but borderline achievable goals and review progress every month. Celebrate wins! Talk internally about strategy all the time, tell everyone what you’re hearing from customers, etc. The more information you share internally—good and bad—the better you’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few traps that founders often fall into. One is that if the company is growing like crazy but everything seems incredibly broken and inefficient, everyone worries that things are going to come unraveled. In practice, this seems to happen rarely (Friendster is the most recent example of a startup dying because of technical debt that I can point to.) Counterintuitively, it turns out that it’s good if you’re growing fast but nothing is optimized—all you need to do is fix it to get more growth! My favorite investments are in companies that are growing really fast but incredibly un-optimized—they are deeply undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related trap is thinking about problems too far in the future—i.e. “How are we going to do this at massive scale?” The answer is to figure it out when you get there. Far more startups die while debating this question than die because they didn’t think about it enough. A good rule of thumb is to only think about how things will work at 10x your current scale. Most early-stage startups should put “Do things that don’t scale” up on their wall and live by it. As an example, great startups always have great customer service in the early days, and bad startups worry about the impact on the unit economics and that it won’t scale. But great customer service makes for passionate early users, and as the product gets better you need less support, because you’ll know what customers commonly struggle with and improve the product/experience in those areas. (By the way, this is a really important example—have great customer support.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a big catch to this—”Do things that don’t scale” does not excuse you from having to eventually make money. It’s ok to have bad unit economics in the early days, but you have to have a good reason for why the unit economics are going to work out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trap is getting demoralized because growth is bad in absolute numbers even though it’s good on a percentage basis. Humans are very bad at intuition around exponential growth. Remind your team of this, and that all giant companies started growing from small numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest traps are the things that founders believe will deliver growth but in practice almost never work and suck up a huge amount of time. Common examples are deals with other companies and the “big press launch”. Beware of these and understand that they effectively never work. Instead get growth the same way all great companies have—by building a product users love, recruiting users manually first, and then testing lots of growth strategies (ads, referral programs, sales and marketing, etc.) and doing more of what works. Ask your customers where you can find more people like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that sales and marketing are not bad words. Though neither will save you if you don’t have a great product, they can both help accelerate growth substantially. If you’re an enterprise company, it’s likely a requirement that your company get good at these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid of sales especially. At least one founder has to get good at asking people to use your product and give you money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Schultz &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec06/&quot;&gt;gave a lecture on growth for consumer products&lt;/a&gt; that’s well worth watching. For B2B products, I think the right answer is almost always to track revenue growth per month, and remember that the longer sales cycle means the first couple of months are going to look ugly (though sometimes selling to startups as initial customers can solve this problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;96&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to distill my advice about how to operate down to only two words, I’d pick focus and intensity. These words seem to really apply to the best founders I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are relentlessly focused on their product and growth. They don’t try to do everything—in fact, they say no a lot (this is hard because the sort of people that start companies are the sort of people that like doing new things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, don’t let your company start doing the next thing until you’ve dominated the first thing. No great company I know of started doing multiple things at once—they start with a lot of conviction about one thing, and see it all the way through. You can do far fewer things than you think. A very, very common cause of startup death is doing too many of the wrong things. Prioritization is critical and hard. (Equally important to setting the company’s priorities is setting your own tactical priorities. What I’ve found works best for me personally is a pen-and-paper list for each day with ~3 major tasks and ~30 minor ones, and an annual to-do list of overall goals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While great founders don’t do many big projects, they do whatever they do very intensely. They get things done very quickly. They are decisive, which is hard when you’re running a startup—you will get a lot of conflicting advice, both because there are multiple ways to do things and because there’s a lot of bad advice out there. Great founders listen to all of the advice and then quickly make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this doesn’t mean doing everything intensely—that’s impossible. You have to pick the right things. As Paul Buchheit says, find ways to get 90% of the value with 10% of the effort. The market doesn’t care how hard you work—it only cares if you do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very hard to be both obsessed with product quality and move very quickly. But it’s one of the most obvious tells of a great founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never, not once, seen a slow-moving founder be really successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not different from other startups. You still have to stay focused and move fast. Companies building rockets and nuclear reactors still manage to do this. All failing companies have a pet explanation for why they are different and don’t have to move fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find something that works, keep going. Don’t get distracted and do something else. Don’t take your foot off the gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get caught up in early success—you didn’t get off to a promising start by going to lots of networking events and speaking on lots of panels. Startup founders who start to have initial success have a choice of two paths: either they keep doing what they’re doing, or they start spending a lot of time thinking about their “personal brand” and enjoying the status of being a founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to turn down the conferences and the press profiles—they feel good, and it’s especially hard to watch other founders in your space get the attention. But this won’t last long. Eventually the press figures out who is actually winning, and if your company is a real success, you’ll have more attention than you’ll ever want. The extreme cases—early-stage founders with their own publicists—that one would think only exist in TV shows actually exist in real life, and they almost always fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus and intensity will win out in the long run. (Charlie Rose once said that things get done in the world through a combination of focus and personal connections, and that’s always stuck with me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;

Table of Contents&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;163&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier I mentioned that the only universal job description of the CEO is to make sure the company wins. Although that’s true, I wanted to talk a little more specifically about how a CEO should spend his or her time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CEO has to 1) set the vision and strategy for the company, 2) evangelize the company to everyone, 3) hire and manage the team, especially in areas where you yourself have gaps 4) raise money, and 5) set the execution quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, find whatever parts of the business you love the most, and stay engaged there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned at the beginning, it’s an intense job. If you are successful, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine—the company will be on your mind all the time. Extreme focus and extreme intensity means it’s not the best choice for work-life balance. You can have one other big thing—your family, doing lots of triathlons, whatever—but probably not much more than that. You have to always be on, and there are a lot of decisions only you can make, no matter how good you get at delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should aim to be super responsive to your team and the outside world, always be clear on the strategy and priorities, show up to everything important, and execute quickly (especially when it comes to making decisions others are blocked on.) You should also adopt a “do whatever it takes” attitude—there will be plenty of unpleasant schleps. If the team sees you doing these things, they will do them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing your own psychology is both really hard and really important. It’s become cliché at this point, but it’s really true—the emotional highs and lows are very intense, and if you don’t figure out how to stay somewhat level through them, you’re going to struggle. Being a CEO is lonely. It’s important to have relationships with other CEOs you can call when everything is melting down (one of the important accidental discoveries of YC was a way for founders to have peers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful startup takes a very long time—certainly much longer than most founders think at the outset. You cannot treat it as an all-nighter. You have to eat well, sleep well, and exercise. You have to spend time with your family and friends. You also need to work in an area you’re actually passionate about—nothing else will sustain you for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything will feel broken all the time—the diversity and magnitude of the disasters will surprise you. Your job is to fix them with a smile on your face and reassure your team that it’ll all be ok. Usually things aren’t as bad as they seem, but sometimes they are in fact really bad. In any case, just keep going. Keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO doesn’t get to make excuses. Lots of bad and unfair things are going to happen. But don’t let yourself say, and certainly not to the team, “if only we had more money” or “if only we had another engineer”. Either figure out a way to make that happen, or figure out what to do without it. People who let themselves make a lot of excuses usually fail in general, and startup CEOs who do it almost always fail. Let yourself feel upset at the injustice for 1 minute, and then realize that it’s up to you to figure out a solution. Strive for people to say “X just somehow always gets things done” when talking about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No first-time founder knows what he or she is doing. To the degree you understand that, and ask for help, you’ll be better off. It’s worth the time investment to learn to become a good leader and manager. The best way to do this is to find a mentor—reading books doesn’t seem to work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising amount of our advice at YC is of the form “just ask them” or “just do it”. First-time founders think there must be some secret for when you need something from someone or you want to do some new thing. But again, startups are where tricks stop working. Just be direct, be willing to ask for what you want, and don’t be a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you distort reality for others but not yourself. You have to convince other people that your company is primed to be the most important startup of the decade, but you yourself should be paranoid about everything that could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be persistent. Most founders give up too quickly or move on to the next product too quickly. If things generally aren’t going well, figure out what the root cause of the problem is and make sure you address that. A huge part of being a successful startup CEO is not giving up (although you don’t want to be obstinate beyond all reason either—this is another apparent contradiction, and a hard judgment call to make.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be optimistic. Although it’s possible that there is a great pessimistic CEO somewhere out in the world, I haven’t met him or her yet. A belief that the future will be better, and that the company will play an important role in making the future better, is important for the CEO to have and to infect the rest of the company with. This is easy in theory and hard in the practical reality of short-term challenges. Don’t lose sight of the long-term vision, and trust that the day-to-day challenges will someday be forgotten and replaced by memories of the year-to-year progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among your most important jobs are defining the mission and defining the values. This can feel a little hokey, but it’s worth doing early on. Whatever you set at the beginning will usually still be in force years later, and as you grow, each new person needs to first buy in and then sell others on the mission and values of the company. So write your cultural values and mission down early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cliché that I think is worth repeating: Building a company is somewhat like building a religion. If people don’t connect what they’re doing day-to-day with a higher purpose they care about, they will not do a great job. I think Airbnb has done the best job at this in the YC network, and I highly recommend taking a look at their cultural values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One mistake that CEOs often make is to innovate in well-trodden areas of business instead of innovating in new products and solutions. For example, many founders think that they should spend their time discovering new ways to do HR, marketing, sales, financing, PR, etc. This is nearly always bad. Do what works in the well-established areas, and focus your creative energies on the product or service you’re building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;

Table of Contents&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;110.97069051167&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring is one of your most important jobs and the key to building a great company (as opposed to a great product.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first piece of advice about hiring is don’t do it. The most successful companies we’ve worked with at YC have waited a relatively long time to start hiring employees. Employees are expensive. Employees add organizational complexity and communication overhead. There are things you can say to your cofounders that you cannot say with employees in the room. Employees also add inertia—it gets exponentially harder to change direction with more people on the team. Resist the urge to derive your self-worth from your number of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best people have a lot of opportunities. They want to join rocketships. If you have nothing, it’s hard to hire them. Once you’re obviously winning, they’ll want to come join you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth repeating that great people have a lot of options, and you need great people to build a great company. Be generous with equity, trust, and responsibility. Be willing to go after people you don’t think you’ll be able to get. Remember that the kind of people you want to hire can start their own companies if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are in recruiting mode (i.e., from when you get product-market fit to T-infinity), you should spend about 25% of your time on it. At least one founder, usually the CEO, needs to get great at recruiting. It’s most CEOs’ number one activity by time. Everyone says that CEOs should spend a lot of their time recruiting, but in practice, none but the best do. There’s probably something to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t compromise on the quality of people you hire. Everyone knows this, and yet everyone compromises on this at some point during a desperate need. Everyone goes on to regret it, and it sometimes almost kills the company. Good and bad people are both infectious, and if you start with mediocre people, the average does not usually trend up. Companies that start off with mediocre early employees almost never recover. Trust your gut on people. If you have doubt, then the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not hire chronically negative people. They do not fit what an early-stage startup needs—the rest of the world will be predicting your demise every day, and the company needs to be united internally in its belief to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value aptitute over experience for almost all roles. Look for raw intelligence and a track record of getting things done. Look for people you like – you'll be spending a lot of time together and often in tense situations. For people you don't already know, try to work on a project together before they join full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in becoming a good manager. This is hard for most founders, and it’s definitely counterintuitive. But it’s important to get good at this. Find mentors that can help you here. If you do not get good at this, you will lose employees quickly, and if you don’t retain employees, you can be the best recruiter in the world and it still won’t matter. Most of the principles on being a good manager are well-covered, but the one that I never see discussed is “don’t go into hero mode”. Most first-time managers fall victim to this at some point and try to do everything themselves, and become unavailable to their staff. It usually ends in a meltdown. Resist all temptation to switch into this mode, and be willing to be late on projects to have a well-functioning team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of managing, try hard to have everyone in the same office. For some reason, startups always compromise on this. But nearly all of the most successful startups started off all together. I think remote work can work well for larger companies but it has not been a recipe for massive success for startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, fire quickly. Everyone knows this in principle and no one does it. But I feel I should say it anyway. Also, fire people who are toxic to the culture no matter how good they are at what they do. Culture is defined by who you hire, fire, and promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire&quot;&gt;I wrote a blog post with more detail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;50&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick word about competitors: competitors are a startup ghost story. First-time founders think they are what kill 99% of startups. But 99% of startups die from suicide, not murder. Worry instead about all of your internal problems. If you fail, it will very likely be because you failed to make a great product and/or failed to make a great company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99% of the time, you should ignore competitors. Especially ignore them when they raise a lot of money or make a lot of noise in the press. Do not worry about a competitor until they are beating you with a real, shipped product. Press releases are easier to write than code, which is easier still than making a great product. In the words of Henry Ford: &quot;The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every giant company has faced worse competitive threats than what you are facing now when they were small, and they all came out ok. There is always a counter-move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, making money. You need to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version of this is that you have to get people to pay you more money than it costs you to deliver your good/service. For some reason, people always forget to take into account the part about how much it costs to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a free product, don’t plan to grow by buying users. That’s really hard for ad-supported businesses. You need to make something people share with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a paid product with less than a $500 customer lifetime value (LTV), you generally cannot afford sales. Experiment with different user acquisition methods like SEO/SEM, ads, mailings, etc., but try to repay your customer acquisition cost (CAC) in 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a paid product with more than a $500 LTV (net to you) you generally can afford direct sales. Try selling the product yourself first to learn what works. Hacking Sales is a useful book to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, try to get to “ramen profitability”—i.e., make enough money so that the founders can live on ramen—as quickly as you can. When you get here, you control your own destiny and are no longer at the whims of investors and financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch your cash flow obsessively. Although it sounds unbelievable, we’ve seen founders run out of money without being aware it was happening a number of times (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/aord.html&quot;&gt;read Paul Graham’s essay&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container-content&quot; readability=&quot;122.29440110142&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most startups raise money at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should raise money when you need it or when it’s available on good terms. Be careful not to lose your sense of frugality or to start solving problems by throwing money at them. Not having enough money can be bad, but having too much money is almost always bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to successfully raising money is to have a good company. All of the other stuff founders do to try to over-optimize the process probably only matters about 5% of the time. Investors are looking for companies that are going to be really successful whether or not they invest, but that can grow faster with outside capital. The “really successful” part is important—because investors’ returns are dominated by the big successes, if an investor believes you have a 100% chance of creating a $10 million company but almost no chance of building a larger company, he/she will still probably not invest even at a very low valuation. Always explain why you could be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are driven by the dual fears of missing the next Google, and fear of losing money on something that in retrospect looks obviously stupid. (For the best companies, they fear both at the same time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a bad idea to try to raise money when your company isn’t in good enough shape to attract capital. You will burn reputation and waste time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get demoralized if you struggle to raise money. Many of the best companies have struggled with this, because the best companies so often look bad at the beginning (and they nearly always look unfashionable.) When investors tell you no, believe the no but not the reason. And remember that anything but “yes” is a “no”—investors have a wonderful ability to say “no” in a way that sounds like “maybe yes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really important to have fundraising conversations in parallel—don’t go down a list of your favorite investors sequentially. The way to get investors to act is fear of other investors taking away their opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View fundraising as a necessary evil and something to get done as quickly as possible. Some founders fall in love with fundraising; this is always bad. It’s best to have just one founder do it so the company doesn’t grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that most VCs don’t know much about most industries. Metrics are always the most convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s beginning to change, but most investors (Y Combinator being a notable exception) unfortunately still require introductions from people you both know to take you seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insist on clean terms (complicated terms compound and get worse each round) but don’t over-optimize, especially on valuation. Valuation is something quantitative to compete on, and so founders love to compete for the highest valuation. But intermediate valuations don’t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first check is the hardest to get, so focus your energies on getting that, which usually means focusing your attention on whoever loves you the most. Always have multiple plans, one of which is not raising anything, and be flexible depending on interest—if you can put more money to good use, and it’s available on reasonable terms, be open to taking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important key to being good at pitching is to make your story as clear and easy to understand as possible. Of course, the most important key is to actually have a good company. There are lots of thoughts about what to include in a pitch, but at a minimum you need to have: mission, problem, product/service, business model, team, market and market growth rate, and financials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that the bar for each round of funding is much higher. If you got away with just being a compelling presenter for your seed round, don’t be surprised when it doesn’t work for your Series A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good investors really do add a lot of value. Bad investors detract a lot. Most investors fall in the middle and neither add nor detract. Investors that only invest a small amount usually don’t do anything for you (i.e., beware party rounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great board members are one of the best outside forcing functions for a company other than users, and outside forcing functions are worth more than most founders think. Be willing to accept a lower valuation to get a great board member who is willing to be very involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/fr.html&quot;&gt;this essay by Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing out there on fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that at least a thousand people have every great idea. One of them actually becomes successful. The difference comes down to execution. It’s a grind, and everyone wishes there were some other way to transform “idea” into “success”, but no one has figured it out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all you need is a great idea, a great team, a great product, and great execution. So easy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h4&gt;PURPOSE:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the DNA protective effects of a standard coffee beverage in comparison to water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;METHODS:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single-blind, randomised controlled study with parallel design included healthy women (n = 50) and men (n = 50) recruited from the general Central European population. The subjects were randomised in a coffee and a control group, with stratification for sex and body mass index. The study comprised two periods of 4 weeks: a preconditioning period, with daily consumption of at least 500 ml water but no coffee, nor tea, nor any other caffeine-containing product. During the subsequent intervention period the coffee group consumed 500 ml of freshly brewed dark roast coffee blend per day, the control group consumed water instead. On the last day of each period, blood was drawn and analysed by comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) to assess the level of DNA damage (strand breakage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;RESULTS:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the intervention period the mean level of DNA strand breaks in the coffee group has decreased in comparison to the control group [difference in means 0.23% TI (tail intensity), p = 0.028]. The mean change from baseline (delta value) was - 23% in the coffee group (p = 0.0012). Effects of coffee intake were similar for men and women. During intervention, neither group showed any significant change in body weight or calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that regular consumption of a dark roast coffee blend has a beneficial protective effect on human DNA integrity in both, men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;JANUARY 15, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. The Resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WE SOMETIMES FORGET that, at the turn of the century, Silicon Valley was in a funk, economic and psychic. The great dot-com bubble of the 1990s had imploded, destroying vast amounts of investment capital along with the savings of many Americans. Trophy startups like Pets.com, Webvan, and Excite@Home, avatars of the so-called New Economy, were punch lines. Disillusioned programmers and entrepreneurs were abandoning their Bay Area bedsits and decamping. Venture funding had dried up. As a business proposition, the information superhighway was looking like a cul-de-sac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, less than 20 years on, everything has changed. The top American internet companies are among the most profitable and highly capitalized businesses in history. Not only do they dominate the technology industry but they have much of the world economy in their grip. Their founders and early backers sit atop Rockefeller-sized fortunes. Cities and states court them with billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies. Bright young graduates covet their jobs. Along with their financial clout, the internet giants hold immense social and cultural sway, influencing how all of us think, act, and converse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley’s Phoenix-like resurrection is a story of ingenuity and initiative. It is also a story of callousness, predation, and deceit. Harvard Business School professor emerita Shoshana Zuboff argues in her new book that the Valley’s wealth and power are predicated on an insidious, essentially pathological form of private enterprise — what she calls “surveillance capitalism.” Pioneered by Google, perfected by Facebook, and now spreading throughout the economy, surveillance capitalism uses human life as its raw material. Our everyday experiences, distilled into data, have become a privately owned business asset used to predict and mold our behavior, whether we’re shopping or socializing, working or voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuboff’s fierce indictment of the big internet firms goes beyond the usual condemnations of privacy violations and monopolistic practices. To her, such criticisms are sideshows, distractions that blind us to a graver danger: By reengineering the economy and society to their own benefit, Google and Facebook are perverting capitalism in a way that undermines personal freedom and corrodes democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism has always been a fraught system. Capable of both tempering and magnifying human flaws, particularly the lust for power, it can expand human possibility or constrain it, liberate people or oppress them. (The same can be said of technology.) Under the Fordist model of mass production and consumption that prevailed for much of the 20th century, industrial capitalism achieved a relatively benign balance among the contending interests of business owners, workers, and consumers. Enlightened executives understood that good pay and decent working conditions would ensure a prosperous middle class eager to buy the goods and services their companies produced. It was the product itself — made by workers, sold by companies, bought by consumers — that tied the interests of capitalism’s participants together. Economic and social equilibrium was negotiated through the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing the tangible product from the center of commerce, surveillance capitalism upsets the equilibrium. Whenever we use free apps and online services, it’s often said, we become the products, our attention harvested and sold to advertisers. But, as Zuboff makes clear, this truism gets it wrong. Surveillance capitalism’s real products, vaporous but immensely valuable, are predictions about our future behavior — what we’ll look at, where we’ll go, what we’ll buy, what opinions we’ll hold — that internet companies derive from our personal data and sell to businesses, political operatives, and other bidders. Unlike financial derivatives, which they in some ways resemble, these new data derivatives draw their value, parasite-like, from human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Googles and Facebooks of the world, we are neither the customer nor the product. We are the source of what Silicon Valley technologists call “data exhaust” — the informational by-products of online activity that become the inputs to prediction algorithms. In contrast to the businesses of the industrial era, whose interests were by necessity entangled with those of the public, internet companies operate in what Zuboff terms “extreme structural independence from people.” When databases displace goods as the engine of the economy, our own interests, as consumers but also as citizens, cease to be part of the negotiation. We are no longer one of the forces guiding the market’s invisible hand. We are the objects of surveillance and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. The Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all began innocently. In the 1990s, before they founded Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer science students who shared a fascination with the arcane field of network theory and its application to the internet. They saw that by scanning web pages and tracing the links between them, they would be able to create a map of the net with both theoretical and practical value. The map would allow them to measure the importance of every page, based on the number of other pages that linked to it, and that data would, in turn, provide the foundation for a powerful search engine. Because the map could also be used to record the routes and choices of people as they traveled through the network, it would provide a finely detailed account of human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google’s early days, Page and Brin were wary of exploiting the data they collected for monetary gain, fearing it would corrupt their project. They limited themselves to using the information to improve search results, for the benefit of users. That changed after the dot-com bust. Google’s once-patient investors grew restive, demanding that the founders figure out a way to make money, preferably lots of it. Under pressure, Page and Brin authorized the launch of an auction system for selling advertisements tied to search queries. The system was designed so that the company would get paid by an advertiser only when a user clicked on an ad. This feature gave Google a huge financial incentive to make accurate predictions about how users would respond to ads and other online content. Even tiny increases in click rates would bring big gains in income. And so the company began deploying its stores of behavioral data not for the benefit of users but to aid advertisers — and to juice its own profits. Surveillance capitalism had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s business now hinged on what Zuboff calls “the extraction imperative.” To improve its predictions, it had to mine as much information as possible from web users. It aggressively expanded its online services to widen the scope of its surveillance. Through Gmail, it secured access to the contents of people’s emails and address books. Through Google Maps, it gained a bead on people’s whereabouts and movements. Through Google Calendar, it learned what people were doing at different moments during the day and whom they were doing it with. Through Google News, it got a readout of people’s interests and political leanings. Through Google Shopping, it opened a window onto people’s wish lists, brand preferences, and other material desires. The company gave all these services away for free to ensure they’d be used by as many people as possible. It knew the money lay in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it embraced surveillance as the core of its business, Google changed. Its innocence curdled, and its idealism became a means of obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as its army of PR agents and lobbyists continued to promote a cuddly Nerds-in-Toyland image for the firm, the organization grew insular and secretive. Seeking to keep the true nature of its work from the public, it adopted what its CEO at the time, Eric Schmidt, called a “hiding strategy” — a kind of corporate omerta backed up by stringent nondisclosure agreements. Page and Brin further shielded themselves from outside oversight by establishing a stock structure that guaranteed their power could never be challenged, neither by investors nor by directors. As one Google executive quoted by Zuboff put it, “Larry [Page] opposed any path that would reveal our technological secrets or stir the privacy pot and endanger our ability to gather data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As networked computers came to mediate more and more of people’s everyday lives, the map of the online world created by Page and Brin became far more lucrative than they could have anticipated. Zuboff reminds us that, throughout history, the charting of a new territory has always granted the mapmaker an imperial power. Quoting the historian John B. Harley, she writes that maps “are essential for the effective ‘pacification, civilization, and exploitation’ of territories imagined or claimed but not yet seized in practice. Places and people must be known in order to be controlled.” An early map of the United States bore the motto “Order upon the Land.” Should Google ever need a new slogan to replace its original, now-discarded “Don’t be evil,” it would be hard-pressed to find a better one than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. The Heist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuboff opens her book with a look back at a prescient project from the year 2000 on the future of home automation by a group of Georgia Tech computer scientists. Anticipating the arrival of “smart homes,” the scholars described how a mesh of environmental and wearable sensors, linked wirelessly to computers, would allow all sorts of domestic routines, from the dimming of bedroom lights to the dispensing of medications to the entertaining of children, to be programmed to suit a house’s occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential to the effort would be the processing of intimate data on people’s habits, predilections, and health. Taking it for granted that such information should remain private, the researchers envisaged a leak-proof “closed loop” system that would keep the data within the home, under the purview and control of the homeowner. The project, Zuboff explains, reveals the assumptions about “datafication” that prevailed at the time: “(1) that it must be the individual alone who decides what experience is rendered as data, (2) that the purpose of the data is to enrich the individual’s life, and (3) that the individual is the sole arbiter of how the data are put to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s most remarkable about the birth of surveillance capitalism is the speed and audacity with which Google overturned social conventions and norms about data and privacy. Without permission, without compensation, and with little in the way of resistance, the company seized and declared ownership over everyone’s information. It turned the details of the lives of millions and then billions of people into its own property. The companies that followed Google presumed that they too had an unfettered right to collect, parse, and sell personal data in pretty much any way they pleased. In the smart homes being built today, it’s understood that any and all data will be beamed up to corporate clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google conducted its great data heist under the cover of novelty. The web was an exciting frontier — something new in the world — and few people understood or cared about what they were revealing as they searched and surfed. In those innocent days, data was there for the taking, and Google took it. The public’s naïveté and apathy were only part of the story, however. Google also benefited from decisions made by lawmakers, regulators, and judges — decisions that granted internet companies free use of a vast taxpayer-funded communication infrastructure, relieved them of legal and ethical responsibility for the information and messages they distributed, and gave them carte blanche to collect and exploit user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the terms-of-service agreements that govern the division of rights and the delegation of ownership online. Non-negotiable, subject to emendation and extension at the company’s whim, and requiring only a casual click to bind the user, TOS agreements are parodies of contracts, yet they have been granted legal legitimacy by the courts. Law professors, writes Zuboff, “call these ‘contracts of adhesion’ because they impose take-it-or-leave-it conditions on users that stick to them whether they like it or not.” Fundamentally undemocratic, the ubiquitous agreements helped Google and other firms commandeer personal data as if by fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bullying style of TOS agreements also characterizes the practice, common to Google and other technology companies, of threatening users with a loss of “functionality” should they try to opt out of data sharing protocols or otherwise attempt to escape surveillance. Anyone who tries to remove a pre-installed Google app from an Android phone, for instance, will likely be confronted by a vague but menacing warning: “If you disable this app, other apps may no longer function as intended.” This is a coy, high-tech form of blackmail: “Give us your data, or the phone dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pulling off its data grab, Google also benefited from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As much as the dot-com crash, the horrors of 9/11 set the stage for the rise of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff notes that, in 2000, members of the Federal Trade Commission, frustrated by internet companies’ lack of progress in adopting privacy protections, began formulating legislation to secure people’s control over their online information and severely restrict the companies’ ability to collect and store it. It seemed obvious to the regulators that ownership of personal data should by default lie in the hands of private citizens, not corporations. The 9/11 attacks changed the calculus. The centralized collection and analysis of online data, on a vast scale, came to be seen as essential to national security. “The privacy provisions debated just months earlier vanished from the conversation more or less overnight,” Zuboff writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and other Silicon Valley companies benefited directly from the government’s new stress on digital surveillance. They earned millions through contracts to share their data collection and analysis techniques with the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. But they also benefited indirectly. Online surveillance came to be viewed as normal and even necessary by politicians, government bureaucrats, and the general public. One of the unintended consequences of this uniquely distressing moment in American history, Zuboff observes, was that “the fledgling practices of surveillance capitalism were allowed to root and grow with little regulatory or legislative challenge.” Other possible ways of organizing online markets, such as through paid subscriptions for apps and services, never even got a chance to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we lose under this regime is something more fundamental than privacy. It’s the right to make our own decisions about privacy — to draw our own lines between those aspects of our lives we are comfortable sharing and those we are not. “Privacy involves the choice of the individual to disclose or to reveal what he believes, what he thinks, what he possesses,” explained Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in a 1967 decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wrote the Bill of Rights believed that every individual needs both to communicate with others and to keep his affairs to himself. That dual aspect of privacy means that the individual should have the freedom to select for himself the time and circumstances when he will share his secrets with others and decide the extent of that sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and other internet firms usurp this essential freedom. “The typical complaint is that privacy is eroded, but that is misleading,” Zuboff writes. “In the larger societal pattern, privacy is not eroded but redistributed. […] Instead of people having the rights to decide how and what they will disclose, these rights are concentrated within the domain of surveillance capitalism.” The transfer of decision rights is also a transfer of autonomy and agency, from the citizen to the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. The Script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing Google’s expansion and coveting its profits, other internet, media, and communications companies rushed into the prediction market, and competition for personal data intensified. It was no longer enough to monitor people online; making better predictions required that surveillance be extended into homes, stores, schools, workplaces, and the public squares of cities and towns. Much of the recent innovation in the tech industry has entailed the creation of products and services designed to vacuum up data from every corner of our lives. There are the chatbots like Alexa and Cortana, the digital assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home, the wearable computers like Fitbit and Apple Watch. There are the navigation, banking, and health apps installed on smartphones and the new wave of automotive media and telematics systems like CarPlay, Android Auto, and Progressive’s Snapshot. And there are the myriad sensors and transceivers of smart homes, smart cities, and the so-called internet of things. Big Brother would be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But spying on the populace is not the endgame. The real prize lies in figuring out ways to use the data to shape how people think and act. “The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” the computer scientist Alan Kay once observed. And the best way to predict behavior is to script it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google realized early on that the internet allowed market research to be conducted on a massive scale and at virtually no cost. Every click could become part of an experiment. The company used its research findings to fine-tune its sites and services. It meticulously designed every element of the online experience, from the color of links to the placement of ads, to provoke the desired responses from users. But it was Facebook, with its incredibly detailed data on people’s social lives, that grasped digital media’s full potential for behavior modification. By using what it called its “social graph” to map the intentions, desires, and interactions of literally billions of individuals, it saw that it could turn its network into a worldwide Skinner box, employing psychological triggers and rewards to program not only what people see but how they react. The company rolled out its now ubiquitous “Like” button, for example, after early experiments showed it to be a perfect operant-conditioning device, reliably pushing users to spend more time on the site, and share more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuboff describes a revealing and in retrospect ominous Facebook study that was conducted during the 2010 US congressional election and published in 2012 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; under the title “A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization.” The researchers, a group of data scientists from Facebook and the University of California at San Diego, manipulated voting-related messages displayed in Facebook users’ news feeds on election day (without the users’ knowledge). One set of users received a message encouraging them to vote, a link to information on poll locations, and an “I Voted” button. A second set saw the same information along with photos of friends who had clicked the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that seeing the pictures of friends increased the likelihood that people would seek information on polling places and end up clicking the “I Voted” button themselves. “The results show,” they reported, “that [Facebook] messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people.” Through a subsequent examination of actual voter records, the researchers estimated that, as a result of the study and its “social contagion” effect, at least 340,000 additional votes were cast in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nudging people to vote may seem praiseworthy, even if done surreptitiously. What the study revealed, though, is how even very simple social media messages, if carefully designed, can mold people’s opinions and decisions, including those of a political nature. As the researchers put it, “online political mobilization works.” Although few heeded it at the time, the study provided an early warning of how foreign agents and domestic political operatives would come to use Facebook and other social networks in clandestine efforts to shape people’s views and votes. Combining rich information on individuals’ behavioral triggers with the ability to deliver precisely tailored and timed messages turns out to be a recipe for behavior modification on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Zuboff, the experiment and its aftermath carry an even broader lesson, and a grim warning. All of Facebook’s information wrangling and algorithmic fine-tuning, she writes, “is aimed at solving one problem: how and when to intervene in the state of play that is your daily life in order to modify your behavior and thus sharply increase the predictability of your actions now, soon, and later.” This goal, she suggests, is not limited to Facebook. It is coming to guide much of the economy, as financial and social power shifts to the surveillance capitalists. “The goal of everything we do is to change people’s actual behavior at scale,” a top Silicon Valley data scientist told her in an interview. “We can test how actionable our cues are for them and how profitable certain behaviors are for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior modification is the thread that ties today’s search engines, social networks, and smartphone trackers to tomorrow’s facial-recognition systems, emotion-detection sensors, and artificial-intelligence bots. What the industries of the future will seek to manufacture is the self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V. The Bargain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/em&gt; is a long, sprawling book, but there’s a piece missing. While Zuboff’s assessment of the costs that people incur under surveillance capitalism is exhaustive, she largely ignores the benefits people receive in return — convenience, customization, savings, entertainment, social connection, and so on. The benefits can’t be dismissed as illusory, and the public can no longer claim ignorance about what’s sacrificed in exchange for them. Over the last two years, the press has uncovered one scandal after another involving malfeasance by big internet firms, Facebook in particular. We know who we’re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that our lives are best evaluated with spreadsheets. Nor is it to downplay the abuses inherent in a system that places control over knowledge and discourse in the hands of a few companies that have both incentive and means to manipulate what we see and do. It is to point out that a full examination of surveillance capitalism requires as rigorous and honest an accounting of its boons as of its banes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the choices we make as consumers and private citizens, we have always traded some of our autonomy to gain other rewards. Many people, it seems clear, experience surveillance capitalism less as a prison, where their agency is restricted in a noxious way, than as an all-inclusive resort, where their agency is restricted in a pleasing way. Zuboff makes a convincing case that this is a short-sighted and dangerous view — that the bargain we’ve struck with the internet giants is a Faustian one — but her case would have been stronger still had she more fully addressed the benefits side of the ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has other, more cosmetic flaws. Zuboff is prone to wordiness and hackneyed phrasing, and she at times delivers her criticism in overwrought prose that blunts its effect. A less tendentious, more dispassionate tone would make her argument harder for Silicon Valley insiders and sympathizers to dismiss. The book is also overstuffed. Zuboff feels compelled to make the same point in a dozen different ways when a half dozen would have been more than sufficient. Here, too, stronger editorial discipline would have sharpened the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever its imperfections, &lt;em&gt;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism&lt;/em&gt; is an original and often brilliant work, and it arrives at a crucial moment, when the public and its elected representatives are at last grappling with the extraordinary power of digital media and the companies that control it. Like another recent masterwork of economic analysis, Thomas Piketty’s 2013 &lt;em&gt;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/em&gt;, the book challenges assumptions, raises uncomfortable questions about the present and future, and stakes out ground for a necessary and overdue debate. Shoshana Zuboff has aimed an unsparing light onto the shadowy new landscape of our lives. The picture is not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/nicholas-carr/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicholas Carr has written several books on technology, economics, and culture, including&lt;/em&gt; The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google&lt;em&gt;. He is the Richmond Visiting Professor at Williams College.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
