<title>A Janitor at Frito-Lay Invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos</title>
<link>https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;On an early morning in the late 1980s, a group of the highest-powered executives at Frito-Lay — the CEO, CMO, and a platoon of VPs — gathered in a California conference room to hear what Richard Montañez had to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez didn’t share their pedigree. He wasn’t an executive. He had no fancy degree. He had a 4th-grade-level education, and couldn’t read or write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez was a janitor. But he was a janitor with an idea — an idea that would make the company billions of dollars and become one of history’s most celebrated and iconic snack foods: Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But first, he had to convince the world to hear him out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking grapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez grew up in the 1960s in Guasti, California, a tiny unincorporated farming town 40 miles east of Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the sweltering Cucamonga Valley sun, his family — mother, father, grandfather, and 11 children — scraped together a meager living picking grapes, and slept together in a one-room cinderblock abode at the labor camp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a first-generation Mexican immigrant at an all-white school, Montañez had access to few resources and struggled to understand his teachers. “I remember my mom getting me ready for school and I was crying,” he later told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowrider.com/news/1108-lmrp-richard-montanez-raza-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lowrider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;magazine. “I couldn’t speak English.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day in class, the teacher went around the room asking each kid to name his or her dream job:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctor… astronaut… veterinarian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;When she called on Montañez, he froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I realized I didn’t have a dream,” he says. “There was no dream where I came from.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14424&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14424&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14424&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guasti.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1396&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14424&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The Cucamonga Valley region, in San Bernardino County, California, where Richard Montañez grew up (Image: Paul Hofer III)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez soon stopped getting on the school bus and began boarding the work truck with his father and grandfather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Burrito-Cookie-Richard-Montanez/dp/1622957911&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dropping out of school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he worked the fields in 110&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;°F heat and took on odd jobs slaughtering chickens at a poultry factory, washing cars, and picking weeds. With a 4th-grade-level education and few economic opportunities,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Montañez saw no path out of poverty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, in 1976, a neighbor told him about a job opening that would change his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no such thing as ‘just a janitor’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Down the road, in Rancho Cucamonga, the Frito-Lay plant was looking for a janitor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At $4 per hour ($18 in 2019 dollars), the job paid many multiples of what Montañez made in the fields. It represented a better life — insurance, benefits, social mobility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unable to read or write, the 18-year-old recruited his wife to help fill out an application. He journeyed down a dusty road, met with the hiring manager, and got the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When he broke the news to his family, his grandfather imparted a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/video/wkno-conversation-conversation-richard-montanez/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;piece of advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that would always stick with him: “Make sure that floor shines,” the man told his grandson. “And let them know that a Montañez mopped it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez decided he was going to be the “best janitor Frito-Lay had ever seen” — and he quickly made his presence known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Every time someone walked into a room, it would smell fresh,” he says. “I realized there’s no such thing as ‘just a janitor’ when you believe you’re going to be the best.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14425&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14425&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14425&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/plant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1583&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14425&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The Frito-Lay plant in Bakersfield, California (via CLUI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez also developed the philosophy that “it’s not about who you know — it’s about who knows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In between shifts, he set out to make himself seen, learning as much as he could about the company’s products, spending time in the warehouse, and watching the machines churn out crunchy snacks in the lonely midnight hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And eventually, his insatiable curiosity would pay off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I saw no products catering to Latinos”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the mid-1980s, Frito-Lay had fallen on tough times. As a way to boost morale, then-CEO Roger Enrico recorded a video message and disseminated it to the company’s 300k employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video, Enrico encouraged every worker at the company to “act like an owner.” Most employees brushed it off as a management cliché; Montañez took it to heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here’s my invitation… here’s the CEO telling me, the janitor, that I can act like an owner,” he later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D6nfezrVV4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I didn’t know what I was going to do. Didn’t need to. But I knew I was going to act like an owner.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After nearly a decade mopping floors, Montañez gathered the courage to ask one of the Frito-Lay salesmen if he could tag along and learn more about the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They went to a convenience store in a Latino neighborhood — and while the salesman restocked inventory, Montañez made a fortuitous observation: “I saw our products on the shelves and they were all plain: Lay’s, Fritos, Ruffles,” he recalls. “And right next to these chips happened to be a shelf of Mexican spices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that moment, he realized that Frito-Lay had “nothing spicy or hot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks later, Montañez stopped at a local vendor to get some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenoshery.com/elote-corn-mexican-street-corn/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;elote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Mexican “street corn” doused in chili powder, salt, cotija, lime juice, and crema fresca. Cob in hand, a “revelation” struck:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if I put chili on a Cheeto?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14426&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14426&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14426&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/elote.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1629&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14426&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Elote, the Mexican corn treat that inspired Flamin’ Hot Cheetos (via Vallarta Supermarkets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduced to the world in 1948,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheetos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;— crunchy corn-based nuggets coated in cheese-flavored powder — were a flagship product of Frito-Lay. And while they were popular among California’s growing base of Latino consumers, the company had yet to consider re-tailoring the product’s taste profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Nobody had given any thought to the Latino market,” recalls Montañez. “But everywhere I looked, I saw it ready to explode.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, Montañez heeded the CEO’s words and “acted like an owner.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working late one night at the production facility, he scooped up some Cheetos that hadn’t yet been dusted in cheese. He took them home and, with the help of his wife, covered them in his own concoction of chili powder and other “secret” spices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When he handed them out to family members and friends, the snacks were met with universal enthusiasm. He just needed a bigger audience…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So he called the CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was naive,” Montañez later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/video/wkno-conversation-conversation-richard-montanez/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to call the CEO… I didn’t know the rules.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finding Roger Enrico’s phone number was easy enough: It was listed in a company directory. He rang the line, and was put through to the chief’s executive assistant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mr. Enrico’s office. Who is this?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Richard Montañez.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What division are you with?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“California.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re the VP overseeing California?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No, I work at the Rancho Cucamonga plant.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, so you’re the VP of operations?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No, I work inside the plant.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re the plant manager?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No. I’m the janitor.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The assistant paused for what seemed like an eternity. “One moment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14428&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14428&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14428&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/call.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1933&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14428&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Richard Montañez (via Twitter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, a voice on the other line: “Hello, this is Roger.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez told the CEO he’d heeded the call to action. He’d studied the company’s products, identified a demand in the market, and even crafted his own rudimentary snacks in his kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enrico loved the ingenuity: He told the janitor he’d be at the plant in 2 weeks and asked him to prepare a presentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moments after Montañez hung up the phone, the plant manager stormed up to him. “He said, ‘Who do you think you are? Who let the janitor call the CEO?’” recalls Montañez. “Then he said, ‘YOU’RE doing this presentation!’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The birth of the Hot Cheeto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez was 26 years old. In his words, he couldn’t read or write very well and had no knowledge about how to formulate a business proposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But he wasn’t about to give up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Accompanied by his wife, he went to the library, found a book on marketing strategies, and copied the first 5 paragraphs word for word onto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH4pFUxu9s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;transparencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. At home, he filled 100 plastic baggies with his homemade treats, sealed them with a clothing iron, and manually drew a logo and design on each package.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the day of the presentation, he bought a $3 tie — black with blue and red stripes — and had his neighbor knot it for him. As he gathered the bags, his wife stopped him near the door: “Don’t forget who you are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14430&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14430&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14430&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hot-cheetos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1700&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14430&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Hot Cheetos in action (Frito-Lay)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez stepped into the boardroom. “Here I was,” he says, “a janitor presenting to some of the most highly qualified executives in America.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At one point during the presentation, an executive in the room interjected: “How much market share do you think you can get?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It hit me that I had no idea what he was talking about, or what I was doing,” Montañez&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowrider.com/news/1108-lmrp-richard-montanez-raza-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I was shaking, and I damn near wanted to pass out…[but] I opened my arms and I said, ‘This much market share!’ I didn’t even know how ridiculous that looked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The room went silent as the CEO stood up and smiled. “Ladies and gentlemen, do you realize we have an opportunity to go after this much market share?” he said, stretching out his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He turned to Montañez. “Put that mop away, you’re coming with us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling hot, hot, hot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months later, with Montañez’s help, Frito-Lay began testing Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in small Latino markets in East Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it performed well, the company would move forward with the product; if it didn’t, they’d scratch it — and Montañez would likely return to janitorial duties. This was his one shot, and some folks didn’t want things to work out for him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It seemed there was a group of [executives] who wanted it to fail,” he later told the podcast,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-passionate-few/id1162369953?i=1000392815979&amp;amp;mt=2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Passionate Few&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “They thought I got lucky. They were paid big bucks to come up with these ideas… they didn’t want some janitor to do it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_14431&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-14431&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14431&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cheeto-sign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;2104&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-14431&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Montañez signs a young fan’s Hot Cheeto bag (@daliaabbas9, via Deskgram)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Montañez assembled a small team of family members and friends, went to the test markets, and bought every bag of Hot Cheetos he could find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’d tell the owner, ‘Man, these are great,’” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-passionate-few/id1162369953?i=1000392815979&amp;amp;mt=2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Next week, I’d come back and there’d be a whole rack.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1992, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos were greenlit for a national release. And in short order, the snack became one of the most successful product launches in Frito-Lay history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From janitor to VP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos are one of Frito-Lay’s hottest-selling commodities — a multi-billion-dollar snack celebrated by everyone from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2014/WRN/103114-katy-perry-594.jpg?itok=HXYMvo1V&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/03/26/395598079/guess-what-makes-the-cut-as-a-smart-snack-in-schools-hot-cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;middle-schoolers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on meal vouchers. There’s even a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLy4j8EZIk&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rap song&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Montañez is no longer sweeping floors: Over a 35-year career, the former janitor rose through the corporate ranks and is now the vice president of multicultural sales for PepsiCo America (the holding company of Frito-Lay).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before Montañez joined the executive team, Frito-Lay had only 3 Cheeto products; since then, the company has launched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timelinemaker.com/blog/featured-timeline/history-of-cheetos-timeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;more than 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, each worth $300m+.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recognized by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newsweek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;as one of the most influential Hispanic leaders in America, Montañez is a gifted speaker who often tours the country giving&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D6nfezrVV4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;keynotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And soon, his story will hit the silver screen: Fox Searchlight Pictures is currently&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://alumni.harvard.edu/events/flamin-hot-cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;working on a biopic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about his life, appropriately titled “Flamin’ Hot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He still lives in Rancho Cucamonga, where he gives back to his community through a nonprofit he launched and teaches MBA classes at a nearby college.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, a student asked him how he was teaching without a Ph.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I do have a Ph.D.,” he responded. “I’ve been poor, hungry and determined.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'll be using Stripe for processing any payments.

<title>We tried to hustle our way into YC after we got rejected</title>
<link>https://veed.io/blog/rejected-from-yc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://veed.io/blog/rejected-from-yc/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We got rejected from YC S19! Bummer, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our product &lt;a href=&quot;http://veed.io&quot;&gt;VEED - an online video editor&lt;/a&gt; had been doing really well recently. Over the space of a year, we had a 60% MoM Growth Rate, 35K MAU and a great team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, we submitted our application, and kinda forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later we got an email saying that a partner would like to speak to us. And a few days later we were having a chat with Michael Seibel (CEO of Ycombinator). The call went well, Michael seemed to like what we're doing, as he himself had a long history working with video startups: Justin TV, which later became Twitch (sold to Amazon) as well as Socialcam (sold to Autodesk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after the initial call we got the email from YC inviting us to Silicon Valley to meet the partners for the final stage of the YC interviews. As you can imagine, for two young founders who just quit the jobs, we were ecstatic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our flights, and a few weeks later we landed in SF airport and got an UBER to our overpriced Airbnb in mountain view. We spent one day prepping for our interview and before we knew it, the interview day had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking the flight - Posting next to an oversized car - Pretending to do interview prep 
&lt;p&gt;The interview was intense, it lasted just 10 mins and in that time you are bombarded with questions from all sides of the room.  The vulnerable parts of your startup are uncovered in the first 30 seconds and from there on they keep digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the interview we took a moment to reflect, we thought it went ok. By no means did we think it was a home run, but we thought we were in with a chance. Then we took the mandatory photo with the YC sign and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/IMG_0108.JPG&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Pimping next to the YC sign
&lt;p&gt;We had planned to spend another day in Mountain view near the YC office but could not deal with hanging around in the quiet suburban town. So we packed our bags and headed for the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-gallery-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/IMG_0177-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2664&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Arriving in San Francisco
&lt;p&gt;We checked into our hostel and chilled out in our room waiting for a response. Heres the deal, If you get rejected you get an email and if you get in you receive a phone call. 6pm arrived and we were constantly refreshing our emails and checking our phones. The wait was driving us insane, so we went to the local liquor store and grabbed a few beers to ease the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our return, we got the email, as you know, we got rejected from YC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-17-at-18.54.58.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;YC rejection email after interview
&lt;p&gt;We updated our team, friends and family and then over a few bottles of wine, we hatched a master plan. Ok, that plan was pretty bad and almost illegible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/IMG_0311.JPG&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Master plan to get into YC
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we hatched a better plan. From the rejection email, we thought that the only negative point letting us down was the fact that we had no MRR. Therefore, we thought that if we can get first paying users and MRR over the weekend and get back to YC next Monday morning, they would see that we had achieved MRR in only a few days. Additionally, we would look like a team who could move fast, listen to feedback and get stuff done. But at this point in time, it was not guaranteed that we could get MRR over just one weekend, let alone build an entire infrastructure that is necessary for it in time. This was the new plan, a sober plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/IMG_0309.JPG&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Our new plan of action
&lt;p&gt;We knew it was a long shot but it was worth a go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and hustle our way back into YC we had to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build payments and account system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert 10 paying users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send an email to YC and for them to read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And If we did all this in time, we might be in with a shot (another shot)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday-11-00-am&quot;&gt;Friday 11:00 am&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at 11:00 am on Friday morning, we opened our laptops, grabbed strong coffees and started programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday-2-00-am&quot;&gt;Saturday 2:00 am&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2:00 am Saturday morning we had payments and video watermarks integrated. We did not want to deploy on little sleep, so thought we should tidy the final bits up in the morning and deploy when on a clear head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-18-at-14.41.04.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Everything going to plan
&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday-1-00-pm&quot;&gt;Saturday 1:00 pm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1:00 pm on Saturday having spent a few hours testing and fixing a few bugs we were, finally, ready to push our changes live. At 1 pm Saturday afternoon we deployed the app with our first paid feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday-1-01-pm&quot;&gt;Saturday 1:01 pm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1:01 pm we got out first paid users!! I ran around the room like a kid who just arrived at Disneyland. Tim was so happy he could finally go nap after programming for so long. BUT, it turns out stripe was in test mode. F******.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-18-at-14.36.16-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday-2-00-pm&quot;&gt;Saturday 2:00 pm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2:00 pm stripe was out of test mode and our server invalidation was taking effect. And that was it, our first paid users came officially in the bag!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/IMG_0318.JPG&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Our first ever paid user
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, we hit our mailing list, added a banner to the top of the site. By Monday morning at 8 am we had 20 paid users (Not a bad result right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Monday at 9 am on the DOT we emailed the YC partner who sent us the feedback and asked them to reconsider. This was the email we sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-17-at-18.58.20.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the result was going to be, we felt like we were going to leave San Francisco better off than when we arrived. We had positive feedback from YC, we now had paying users and we were moving fast and feeling even more driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 5pm we got another email from YC. They said they were unable to change their decision but would happily do office hours with us before the next batch. We walked away feeling like we gave it our all and on the plus side, we had our first MRR and also the opportunity to run office hours with YC before the next batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-17-at-18.58.00.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, maybe we were too early for YC and their decision was just. We believe that YC are looking for companies that are ready to accelerate and we were just not ready. It is also good to remember that the goal of a startup is not to get into YC. The goal of a startup is to build something amazing. After this, we headed to a local bar, had a few beers and reminisced about what a crazy week it had been.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook moderators break NDAs to expose working conditions</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;v2DkRn&quot;&gt;Keith Utley loved to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0ouuIs&quot;&gt;First, he served in the Coast Guard, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. He married, had a family, and devoted himself utterly to his two little girls. After he got out of the military, he worked as a moderator for Facebook, where he purged the social network of the worst stuff that its users post on a daily basis: the hate speech, the murders, the child pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eCJaG8&quot;&gt;Utley worked the overnight shift at a Facebook content moderation site in Tampa, FL, operated by a professional services vendor named Cognizant. The 800 or so workers there face relentless pressure from their bosses to better enforce the social network’s community standards, which receive near-daily updates that leave its contractor workforce in a perpetual state of uncertainty. The Tampa site has routinely failed to meet the 98 percent “accuracy” target set by Facebook. In fact, with a score that has been hovering around 92, it is Facebook’s worst-performing site in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;Jx8Dvk&quot;&gt;The stress of the job weighed on Utley, according to his former co-workers, who, like all Facebook contractors at the Tampa site, must sign a 14-page nondisclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eO1PZh&quot;&gt;“The stress they put on him — it’s unworldly,” one of Utley’s managers told me. “I did a lot of coaching. I spent some time talking with him about things he was having issues seeing. And he was always worried about getting fired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hagNVT&quot;&gt;On the night of March 9th, 2018, Utley slumped over at his desk. Co-workers noticed that he was in distress when he began sliding out of his chair. Two of them began to perform CPR, but no defibrillator was available in the building. A manager called for an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aKXUmp&quot;&gt;The Cognizant site in Tampa is set back from the main road in an office park, and between the dim nighttime lighting and discreet exterior signage, the ambulance appears to have had trouble finding the building. Paramedics arrived 13 minutes after the first call, one worker told me, and when they did, Utley had already begun to turn blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;cuRwIe&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;He left behind a wife, Joni, and two young daughters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tf4Wv2&quot;&gt;Paramedics raced Utley to a hospital. At Cognizant, some employees were distraught — one person told me he passed by one of the site’s designated “tranquility rooms” and found one of his co-workers, a part-time preacher, praying loudly in tongues. Others ignored the commotion entirely, and continued to moderate Facebook posts as the paramedics worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EN17AF&quot;&gt;Utley was pronounced dead a short while later at the hospital, the victim of a heart attack. Further information about his health history, or the circumstances of his death, could not be learned. He left behind a wife, Joni, and two young daughters. He was 42 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9i4B3j&quot;&gt;On Monday morning, workers on the day shift were informed that there had been an incident, and they began collecting money to buy a card and send flowers. But some site leaders did not initially tell workers that Utley had died, and instructed managers not to discuss his death, current and former employees told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JuMFOB&quot;&gt;“Everyone at leadership was telling people he was fine — ‘oh, he’ll be okay,’” one co-worker recalled. “They wanted to play it down. I think they were worried about people quitting with the emotional impact it would have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oEitZD&quot;&gt;But the illusion shattered later that day, when Utley’s father, Ralph, came to the site to gather his belongings. He walked into the building and, according to a co-worker I spoke to, said: “My son died here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;A7IW9n&quot;&gt;In February, I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona&quot;&gt;the secret lives of Facebook contractors in America&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2016, when the company came under heavy criticism for failing to prevent various abuses of its platform, Facebook has expanded its workforce of people working on safety and security around the world to 30,000. About half of those are content moderators, and the vast majority are contractors hired through a handful of large professional services firms. In 2017, Facebook began opening content moderation sites in American cities including Phoenix, Austin, and Tampa. The goal was to improve the accuracy of moderation decisions by entrusting them to people more familiar with American culture and slang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JpEBFK&quot;&gt;Cognizant received a two-year, $200 million contract from Facebook to do the work, according to a former employee familiar with the matter. But in return for policing the boundaries of free expression on one of the internet’s largest platforms, individual contractors in North America make as little as $28,800 a year. They receive two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch each day, along with nine minutes per day of “wellness” time that they can use when they feel overwhelmed by the emotional toll of the job. After regular exposure to graphic violence and child exploitation, many workers are subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;UnDgFQ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three former moderators for Facebook in North America agreed to break their nondisclosure agreements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XpSSaS&quot;&gt;My initial report focused on Phoenix, where workers told me that they had begun to embrace fringe views after continuously being exposed to conspiracy theories at work. One brought a gun to work to protect himself against the possibility of a fired employee returning to the office seeking vengeance. Others told me they are haunted by visions of the images and videos they saw during their time on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3odUOy&quot;&gt;Conditions at the Phoenix site have not improved significantly since I visited. Last week, some employees were sent home after an infestation of bed bugs was discovered in the office — the second time bed bugs have been found there this year. Employees who contacted me worried that the infestation would spread to their own homes, and said managers told them Cognizant would not pay to clean their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aHzeIN&quot;&gt;“Bed bugs can be found virtually every place people tend to gather, including the workplace,” Cognizant said in a statement. “No associate at this facility has formally asked the company to treat an infestation in their home. If someone did make such a request, management would work with them to find a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;aYgofc&quot;&gt;Facebook executives have maintained that the working conditions described to me by dozens of contractors do not accurately reflect the daily lives of the majority of its workers. But after publishing my story about Phoenix, I received dozens of messages from other contractors around the world, many of whom reported having similar experiences. The largest single group of messages I received came from current and former Facebook contractors in Tampa. Many of them have worked closely with employees at the Phoenix site, and believe working conditions in Florida are even more grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3pNIQq&quot;&gt;In May, I traveled to Florida to meet with these Facebook contractors. This article is based on interviews with 12 current and former moderators and managers at the Tampa site. In most cases, I agreed to use pseudonyms to protect the employees from potential retaliation from Facebook and Cognizant. But for the first time, three former moderators for Facebook in North America agreed to break their nondisclosure agreements and discuss working conditions at the site on the record.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite pressure to improve their scores, moderators here have never consistently met the 98 percent accuracy target set for them by Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eJ0blF&quot;&gt;Employees told me that pressure from managers to improve its performance has taken a toll on the workforce. Cognizant’s contract with Facebook is coming up for renewal, and with the entire company struggling to hit the 98 percent accuracy target, there are widespread concerns internally that Cognizant will lose Facebook’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VzdWrB&quot;&gt;Contractors told me that Cognizant had lured them away from less demanding jobs by promising regular schedules, bonuses, and career development, only to renege on all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9K62JC&quot;&gt;They described a filthy workplace in which they regularly find pubic hair and other bodily waste at their workstations. Employees said managers laugh off or ignore sexual harassment and threats of violence. Two discrimination cases have been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;u8obYu&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were bodies in seats,” one former moderator told me&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tl87QK&quot;&gt;They said marijuana use is so prevalent that the site manager jokingly complained at an all-hands meeting that he had gotten a contact high walking in the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Pmsb0D&quot;&gt;More than anything else, the contractors described an environment in which they are never allowed to forget how quickly they can be replaced. It is a place where even Keith Utley, who died working alongside them, would receive no workplace memorial — only a passing mention during team huddles in the days after he passed. “There is no indication that this medical condition was work related,” Cognizant told me in a statement. “Our associate’s colleagues, managers and our client were all saddened by this tragic event.” (The client is Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;V9sCMX&quot;&gt;Utley’s family could not be reached for comment. Employees who began working after he died told me they had never heard his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PwF5JG&quot;&gt;“We were bodies in seats,” one former moderator told me. “We were nothing to them — at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;p3sklu&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16351794/VRG_ILLO_3487_005.0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;clip-circle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;mAWKwZ&quot;&gt;Shawn Speagle was 23 and employed at an online education company working with English language learners when he visited a Cognizant job fair. A recruiter there described to him a role in which Speagle would primarily help businesses analyze engagement on their Facebook pages. He might have to do some content moderation, the recruiter said, but Speagle entered the interview believing he was about to embark on a new career in high technology — one that he hoped would eventually lead to a full-time role at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iyMRdF&quot;&gt;Cognizant offered Speagle $15 an hour to do the job full time — a marked improvement over his previous job, which was seasonal. Only after he began training did he realize that the job would not, in fact, involve helping businesses with Facebook marketing. Instead, two weeks after Speagle was put onto the production floor, a manager told him he and a colleague would be reviewing graphic violence and hate speech full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vHPlyP&quot;&gt;“For our associates who opt to work in content moderation, we are transparent about the work they will perform,” a Cognizant spokesman said in response. “They are made aware of the nature of the role before and during the hiring process, and then given extensive and specific training before working on projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L6PPOF&quot;&gt;But had his managers asked, they would have learned that Speagle had a history of anxiety and depression, and that he might not be suited well for the role. No one did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;E1EPWW&quot;&gt;“They just said me and [my colleague] were very meticulous and had a lot of promise to move up to the SME position,” Speagle said, referring to the subject matter experts who make $1 more per hour in exchange for answering moderators’ questions about Facebook policy. “They said Facebook is basically shoving all of their graphic violence content to us, that they didn’t want it anymore. So they had to move more people to cover it. And that’s all that we saw, every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8eT3eO&quot;&gt;Speagle vividly recalls the first video he saw in his new assignment. Two teenagers spot an iguana on the ground, and one picks it up by the tail. A third teenager films what happens next: the teen holding the iguana begins smashing it onto the street. “They beat the living shit out of this thing,” Speagle told me, as tears welled up in his eyes. “The iguana was screaming and crying. And they didn’t stop until the thing was a bloody pulp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EmeTCE&quot;&gt;Under the policy, the video was allowed to remain on Facebook. A manager told him that by leaving the video online, authorities would be able to catch the perpetrators. But as the weeks went on, the video continued to reappear in his queue, and Speagle realized that police were unlikely to look into the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2y3CZT&quot;&gt;Speagle had volunteered at animal shelters in the past, and watching the iguana die on a regular basis rattled him. “They kept reposting it again and again and again,” he said, pounding the table as he spoke. “It made me so angry. I had to listen to its screams all day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;lT4Krz&quot;&gt;Cognizant’s Tampa facility opened in a maze-like office park in the summer of 2017, about two months after the Phoenix facility came online. It operates out of a single-story building next to a pond fed by two storm drains. On most days, an alligator emerges from one of the drains to bask in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NQailS&quot;&gt;Before the office opened, the company began advertising work on Indeed and other job sites, using opaque titles such as “social media analyst.” Initially, applicants are not told they will be working for Facebook — only a “large social media company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UPek3s&quot;&gt;Cognizant was not always straightforward with applicants about the nature of the work in Tampa. Marcus*, who worked in management, told me that a recruiter had persuaded him to leave a more normal job with the promise of a regular schedule, performance bonuses, and a good work-life balance. Once he joined, though, he was made to work nights, and the bonuses never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ABfBWY&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Find bodies wherever you can, ask as few questions as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LOX4Zl&quot;&gt;Marcus was made to moderate Facebook content — an additional responsibility he says he was not prepared for. A military veteran, he had become desensitized to seeing violence against people, he told me. But on his second day of moderation duty, he had to watch a video of a man slaughtering puppies with a baseball bat. Marcus went home on his lunch break, held his dog in his arms, and cried. &lt;em&gt;I should quit,&lt;/em&gt; he thought to himself, &lt;em&gt;but I know there’s people at the site that need me.&lt;/em&gt; He ultimately stayed for a little over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Jtd40d&quot;&gt;Cognizant calls the part of the building where contractors do their work “the production floor,” and it quickly filled with employees. The minimum wage in Florida is $8.46, and at $15 an hour, the job pays better than most call center work in the area. For many content moderators — Cognizant refers to them by the enigmatic title of “process executive” — it was their first real job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wP70l9&quot;&gt;In its haste to fill the workplace, Cognizant made some odd staffing decisions. Early on, the company hired Gignesh Movalia, a former investment advisor, as a moderator. Cognizant conducts background checks on new hires, but apparently failed even to run a basic web search on Movalia. Had they done so, they would have learned that in 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his involvement in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/tampa/news/press-releases/florida-investment-adviser-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-for-orchestrating-9-million-investment-fraud-scheme&quot;&gt;$9 million investment fraud scheme&lt;/a&gt;. According to the FBI, Movalia had falsely claimed to have access to shares of a fast-growing technology startup about to begin trading on the public market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pBS3Ut&quot;&gt;The startup was Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;B6XP4X&quot;&gt;Movalia was eventually fired, but employees I spoke with believed his tenure exemplified Cognizant’s approach to hiring moderators: find bodies wherever you can, ask as few questions as possible, and get them into a seat on the production floor where they can start working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;awzPeV&quot;&gt;The result is a raucous workplace where managers send regular emails to the staff complaining about their behavior on the site. Nearly every person I interviewed independently compared the Tampa office to a high school. Loud altercations, often over workplace romances, regularly take place between co-workers. Verbal and physical fights break out on a monthly basis, employees told me. A dress code was instituted to discourage employees from wearing provocative clothing to work — “This is not a night club,” read an email to all employees obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Another email warned employees that there had been “numerous incidents of theft” on the property, including stolen food from the office refrigerator, food from vending machines, and employees’ personal items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VOZmn1&quot;&gt;Michelle Bennetti and Melynda Johnson both began working at the Tampa site in June 2018. They told me that the daily difficulty of moderating content, combined with a chaotic office environment, made life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;EexEBz&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It smelled horrendous all the time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QKWEKy&quot;&gt;“At first it didn’t bother me — but after a while, it started taking a toll,” Bennetti told me. “I got to feel, like, a cloud — a darkness — over me. I started being depressed. I’m a very happy, outgoing person, and I was [becoming] withdrawn. My anxiety went up. It was hard to get through it every day. It started affecting my home life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qsfcpb&quot;&gt;Johnson was particularly disturbed by the site’s sole bathroom, which she regularly found in a state of disrepair. (The company says it has janitors available every shift in Tampa.) In the stalls, signs posted in response to employee misbehavior proliferated. &lt;em&gt;Do not use your feet to flush the toilet. Do not flush more than five toilet seat covers at one time. Do not put any substances, natural or unnatural, on the walls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sqRf3S&quot;&gt;“And obviously the signs are there for a reason, because people are doing this,” said Johnson, who worked at the site until March. “Every bit of that building was absolutely disgusting. You’d go in the bathroom and there would be period blood and poop all over the place. It smelled horrendous all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1NyFa7&quot;&gt;She added: “It’s a sweatshop in America.”&lt;/p&gt;

Johnson calls the office “a sweatshop in America.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2OonUs&quot;&gt;The work day in Tampa is divided into five shifts, and desks are shared between employees. Contractors I spoke with said they would frequently come to work and find their workstation for the day in dire condition — encountering boogers, fingernails, and pubic hairs, among other items. The desks would be cleaned whenever Facebook made one of its regular planned visits to the site. At other times, employees told me, the office was filthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SoZkf5&quot;&gt;Florida law does not require employers to offer sick leave, and so Cognizant workers who feel ill must instead use personal leave time. (They are granted five hours of personal leave per pay period.) Missing work is one of the few reasons Cognizant regularly fires its contractors. And so to avoid receiving an “occurrence,” as the company calls unapproved absences, contractors who have exhausted their break time come to work sick — and occasionally vomit in trash cans on the production floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;jPMO11&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;A manager saw that she was not feeling well, and brought a trash can to her desk so she could vomit in it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hcojIN&quot;&gt;A worker named Lola* told me that health problems had resulted in her receiving so many occurrences she was at risk of being fired. She began going into work even when she felt ill to the point of throwing up. Facebook contractors are required to use a browser extension to report every time they use the restroom, but during a recent illness, Lola quickly took all her allotted breaks. She had previously been written up for going to the bathroom too many times, she said, and so she felt afraid to get up from her desk. A manager saw that she was not feeling well, and brought a trash can to her desk so she could vomit in it. So she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;33xdHj&quot;&gt;“Then I was crying at my desk,” Lola said. “I was like, ‘I can’t go on.’ My co-workers said, ‘Just go home.’ I said ‘I can’t, because I’m going to get an occurrence.’” She stayed at her desk and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OlHxqe&quot;&gt;Employees told me about other disturbing incidents at the Tampa site. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;tOGumo&quot;&gt;An employee who used a colostomy bag had it rupture while she was at work, spilling some waste onto the floor. Senior managers were overheard mocking her. She eventually quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;pRUaVI&quot;&gt;An employee who threatened to “shoot up the building” in a group chat was placed on paid leave and allowed to return. He was fired after making another similar threat. (A Cognizant spokesperson said the company has security personnel on site at all hours. “Our goal is to ensure that our employees feel assured that they work in a safe environment,” he said.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;kbhVjm&quot;&gt;Another employee broadcast himself on Facebook Live talking about wanting to bash a manager’s head in. Another manager determined that he was making a joke, and he was not disciplined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;tMiAok&quot;&gt;In April, two women who work at the Tampa site filed complaints with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that they had been sexually harassed by two of their male co-workers. According to the complaint, the men regularly discussed anal sex in the office. When the women were not receptive to the discussion, one of the men said he “was going to start a YouTube channel and record himself shooting up the place,” according to the complaint. On April 3rd, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office came to the site to interview the women. According to the officer’s report, one of the men had been photographed following one of the women home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id=&quot;jZVrwM&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“what am I going to see today? And am I going to make it home tonight?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qob0b3&quot;&gt;A Cognizant spokesman told me that the employee has been suspended while the claims are being investigated. But some workers say they are still concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gd38K8&quot;&gt;“Every time I get an email or a phone call from my clients, I worry that there’s been a shooting — and I know that’s their worry as well,” said KC Hopkinson, an attorney who represents several current and former Cognizant employees in Tampa. “They go in there every morning asking, ‘what am I going to see today? And am I going to make it home tonight?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZMeTPY&quot;&gt;Hopkinson told me that her clients who have reported incidents to human resources are generally either ignored or retaliated against, a claim that was echoed to me by several other employees there. In some cases, the site’s human resources staff has followed workers who filed complaints to the bathroom, and questioned them about what they were doing for the few minutes they were inside. (“We take allegations such as this very seriously,” a company spokesman told me. “Cognizant strives to create a safe and empowering workplace.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Efvip0&quot;&gt;“I wouldn’t want my worst enemy to work there,” Hopkinson said. “It’s a terrible, terrible environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;r6MawL&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16351371/VRG_ILLO_3487_002.0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;clip-circle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;uKcisz&quot;&gt;For the six months after he was hired, Speagle would moderate 100 to 200 posts a day. He watched people throw puppies into a raging river, and put lit fireworks in dogs’ mouths. He watched people mutilate the genitals of a live mouse, and chop off a cat’s face with a hatchet. He watched videos of people playing with human fetuses, and says he learned that they are allowed on Facebook “as long as the skin is translucent.” He found that he could no longer sleep for more than two or three hours a night. He would frequently wake up in a cold sweat, crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bxDJL7&quot;&gt;Early on, Speagle came across a video of two women in North Carolina encouraging toddlers to smoke marijuana, and helped to notify the authorities. (Moderator tools have a mechanism for escalating issues to law enforcement, and the women were eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Women-filmed-helping-children-smoke-pot-sentenced-to-jail-503040242.html&quot;&gt;convicted of misdemeanor child abuse&lt;/a&gt;.) To Speagle’s knowledge, though, the crimes he saw every day never resulted in legal action being taken against the perpetrators. The work came to feel pointless, never more so than when he had to watch footage of a murder or child pornography case that he had already removed from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f2oHC0&quot;&gt;In June 2018, a month into his job, Facebook began seeing a rash of videos that purportedly depicted organs being harvested from children. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://teyit.org/en/the-claim-of-a-video-that-shows-kidnapped-children-by-organ-traffickers-in-syria/&quot;&gt;It did not&lt;/a&gt;.) So many graphic videos were reported that they could not be contained in Speagle’s queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;EEuj5w&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He just flat-out told me: ‘I don’t really know how to help you guys’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fKH5XR&quot;&gt;“I was getting the brunt of it, but it was leaking into everything else,” Speagle said. “It was mass panic. All the SMEs had to rush in there and try to help people. They were freaking out — they couldn’t handle it. People were crying, breaking down, throwing up. It was like one of those horror movies. Nobody’s prepared to see a little girl have her organs taken out while she’s still alive and screaming.” Moderators were told they had to watch at least 15 to 30 seconds of each video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tJFE3i&quot;&gt;Speagle helps to take care of his parents, who have health problems, and was afraid to quit Cognizant. “It was tough to find a job down here in this market,” he said. To cope with the stress, he began binge-eating pastries from the vending machines, and eventually put on a significant amount of weight. He sought out the on-site counselor for support, but found him unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eNbjZT&quot;&gt;“He just flat-out told me: ‘I don’t really know how to help you guys,’” Speagle said. The counselor he spoke with had been substituting for the regular counselor, who had more training. Cognizant also offers a 24/7 hotline, full healthcare benefits, and other wellness programs. But the experience soured Speagle on the site’s mental health resources. Other times, when he was having a particularly bleak day in the queue, a manager would hand him a bucket of Legos and encourage him to play with them to relieve the stress as he worked. Speagle built a house and a spaceship, but it didn’t make him feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;OgW3wP&quot;&gt;By last fall, Speagle told me, he was sleeping only an hour or two each night. The lack of sleep, coupled with depression, made it difficult for him to exercise. He began lashing out at his parents. Meanwhile, at work, he felt micromanaged by his team leaders, who pressured him to moderate more posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;A44Pdk&quot;&gt;“I felt like I was trapped inside my own body,” he said. “I couldn’t, for the life of me, get up from my desk, or I would be yelled at to stay in my desk. So I was trapped at my desk and in my body. I was so scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hVZTdT&quot;&gt;Cognizant periodically purges large numbers of staff members in what have come to be known as “red bag days” for the red bags that managers give to the newly fired to collect their belongings. Sometimes the dismissals are related to job performance, and sometimes employees aren’t given any explanation at all. Speagle was laid off as part of a red bag day last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ssK2EO&quot;&gt;In February, he went to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with PTSD. He is currently in treatment. Meanwhile, he has gone back to school to get his teaching certificate. Seeing so many children harmed on Facebook made him want to make a positive contribution to the lives of young people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k7Z7BJ&quot;&gt;“I really wanted to make a difference,” Speagle told me of his time working for Facebook. “I thought this would be the ultimate difference-making thing. Because it’s Facebook. But there’s no difference being made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LuFU3n&quot;&gt;I asked him what he thought needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KfwN7C&quot;&gt;“I think Facebook needs to shut down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;s5hvrT&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16351290/VRG_ILLO_3487_004.0.jpg&quot; class=&quot;clip-circle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;hZT7f3&quot;&gt;Last week, I visited the Tampa site with a photographer. It had received a deep cleaning the night before I visited, according to two employees I spoke with, and the bathroom sparkled. As I walked the floor with the site manager and a Facebook spokeswoman, I noted that most rooms smelled of cleaning products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SNcZLx&quot;&gt;Work stopped while we were there to ensure we did not see any Facebook user’s personal information. Moderators, mostly in their 20s and 30s, chatted at their desks, or shot baskets in one of the miniature hoops around the building. The site’s senior managers, who employees say are normally cloistered in their offices, made a show of walking the production floor and chatting with their subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cECbgm&quot;&gt;Every few feet, a wall decal or poster offered an inspirational platitude. Exhortations to always try your hardest and maintain a positive attitude were punctuated with other signs that came across as slightly more sinister. “No news is good news,” read one. “Our reputation depends on you,” read another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;wR2Ir2&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That was a dog-and-pony show”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XgWHLe&quot;&gt;We saw an activity room where workers are invited to participate in yoga sessions, and a break room presided over by a small Buddha holding an electric candle. Across the room from the Buddha, coloring books were fanned out on a table beside windows overlooking the alligator pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JsPDqg&quot;&gt;The tour ended about an hour after we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;r5Sd48&quot;&gt;“That was a dog-and-pony show,” an employee named Bob told me over the phone the next day. “That was completely staged. We’re out there playing games, and the senior management are out there interacting with people — it’s all a facade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8MiT4X&quot;&gt;Facebook sees a similar facade when it visits the site, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ocrHMY&quot;&gt;The person responsible for managing Facebook’s growing contractor workforce is Arun Chandra, whose title is vice president of scaled support. Chandra arrived at Facebook last November after a long career at HP, where he helped to oversee the company’s global supply chain. In his new role, he told me, he hopes to gradually improve contractors’ standard of living while also working to ensure they become more effective at their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;C74J89&quot;&gt;“I’m trying to address the macro picture, and move the bigger things forward in the right way,” said Chandra, who struck me as energetic and deeply sincere. “We’ll never solve 100 percent, but I’m trying to show I can solve 80 to 90 percent of the larger problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;huSSKc&quot;&gt;Chandra has visited more than a dozen of the company’s far-flung partner sites in the United States and abroad, and has plans to visit them all. When he arrives, he likes to pull rank-and-file contractors into rooms and ask them about working conditions without their managers around. He told me that in the Philippines, content moderation has become an attractive career track, and that everywhere he goes, he meets moderators who take great pride in their work. “The level of enthusiasm people have is amazing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PoLAVn&quot;&gt;This spring, Chandra organized a summit of around 200 leaders from content moderation sites around the world — an event he plans to hold twice a year, with another coming this fall. Up until now, vendors have had different policies and programs for promoting workers’ mental health. At the summit, they agreed to share information about their approaches — effectively agreeing to stop competing on the basis of who does a better job taking care of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;AVnWLr&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;While the raises will be a boon to a future workforce, the contractors I spoke to are unlikely to benefit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t9xU5t&quot;&gt;“We have to run a very large-scale platform. We have to take care of the community. And that means we have to get a whole lot of work done,” Chandra said. “But that is not at the expense of [contractors’] well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jE7Mw5&quot;&gt;Chandra plans to launch a new audit program later this year to promote better working conditions. That will include more surprise visits — an effort to get around the dog-and-pony-show phenomenon I observed last week. He also plans to stop evaluating partners on the sole basis of whether vendors achieve a 98 percent accuracy rate — instead, he said, Facebook will develop a balanced “scorecard” approach to measuring vendors’ performance. Chandra intends for worker well-being to be part of that score, though Facebook has not yet determined how it will be measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;j4cx3b&quot;&gt;In May, Facebook announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/05/compensating-and-supporting-contractors/&quot;&gt;it will raise contractor wages by $3 an hour&lt;/a&gt;, make on-site counselors available during all hours of operation, and develop further programs for its contractor workforce. But the pay raises are not due to take effect until the middle of 2020, by which time many, if not most, of the current Tampa workforce will no longer work there. Turnover statistics could not be obtained. But few moderators I have spoken with make it to two years on the job — they either are fired for low accuracy scores, or quit over the working conditions. And so while the raises will be a boon to a future workforce, the contractors I spoke to are unlikely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;FSifzF&quot;&gt;Nor will the many contractors who have already left the job. As in Phoenix, former employees of the Tampa site described lasting emotional disturbances from their work — one for which neither Facebook nor Cognizant offers any support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bkaziA&quot;&gt;I asked Chandra whether Facebook should hire more content moderators in house, rather than relying on big staffing companies. He told me that Facebook’s business changes so quickly that it might not be possible. But he did not rule it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;16QWgN&quot;&gt;“I completely get the debate,” he said. “If anything I’m very empathetic to the entire conversation, having spent a lot of time with these people. I don’t think we have a better answer right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vAjaca&quot;&gt;In the meantime, Facebook is building a “global resiliency team” tasked with improving the well-being of both full-time employees and contractors. Chris Harrison, who leads the team, told me that he aspires to build a wellness program that begins at the point of hiring. He wants to screen employees to gauge their psychological fitness — a move that might prevent someone like Shawn Speagle from being assigned to a queue filled with graphic violence — but says Facebook is still working to understand whether this is possible under employment law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;k6kEx4&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;How much is safe?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BFwPhT&quot;&gt;Harrison plans to make “resiliency” — the art of bouncing back after seeing something awful — a key part of contractor training. He helped to develop new tools for moderators that can automatically blur out faces in disturbing videos, turn them grayscale, or mute the audio — all things that can reduce the psychological harm to the moderator viewing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e9n8DP&quot;&gt;Eventually, Harrison hopes Facebook will offer post-employment counseling to moderators who suffered psychological harm on the job. “Of course we should do that,” he said. But the idea is still in the earliest discussion stages, he said. “There’s just so many layers of complexity globally. It’s really, really hard to pull it off in a legally compliant way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BLOVaE&quot;&gt;I asked Harrison, a licensed clinical psychologist, whether Facebook would ever seek to place a limit on the amount of disturbing content a moderator is given in a day. How much is safe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tzi1FX&quot;&gt;“I think that’s an open question,” he said. “Is there such thing as too much? The conventional answer to that would be, of course, there can be too much of anything. Scientifically, do we know how much is too much? Do we know what those thresholds are? The answer is no, we don’t. Do we need to know? Yeah, for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5VjXxE&quot;&gt;“If there’s something that were to keep me up at night, just pondering and thinking, it’s that question,” Harrison continued. “How much is too much?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;12ThVH&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;vrg-line-break-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16385426/VRG_ILLO_3487_006_LB.0.jpg&quot; id=&quot;mobile-version&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p--has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Pszzym&quot;&gt;If you believe moderation is a high-skilled, high-stakes job that presents unique psychological risks to your workforce, you might hire all of those workers as full-time employees. But if you believe that it is a low-skill job that will someday be done primarily by algorithms, you probably would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RwgGGs&quot;&gt;Instead, you would do what Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter have done, and hire companies like Accenture, Genpact, and Cognizant to do the work for you. Leave to them the messy work of finding and training human beings, and of laying them all off when the contract ends. Ask the vendors to hit some just-out-of-reach metric, and let them figure out how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XIMqAB&quot;&gt;At Google, contractors like these already represent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/4/4/18293900/google-contractors-benefits-policy&quot;&gt;a majority of its workforce&lt;/a&gt;. The system allows tech giants to save billions of dollars a year, while reporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/30/facebook-fourth-quarter-profits-revenues-earnings&quot;&gt;record profits&lt;/a&gt; each quarter. Some vendors may turn out to mistreat their workers, threatening the reputation of the tech giant that hired them. But countless more stories will remain hidden behind nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9yObei&quot;&gt;In the meantime, tens of thousands of people around the world go to work each day at an office where taking care of the individual person is always someone else’s job. Where at the highest levels, human content moderators are viewed as a speed bump on the way to an AI-powered future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;mnMi6e&quot;&gt;In such a system, offices can still look beautiful. They can have colorful murals and serene meditation rooms. They can offer ping pong tables and indoor putting greens and miniature basketball hoops emblazoned with the slogan: “You matter.” But the moderators who work in these offices are not children, and they know when they are being condescended to. They see the company roll an oversized Connect 4 game into the office, as it did in Tampa this spring, and they wonder: &lt;em&gt;When is this place going to get a defibrillator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GOhL15&quot;&gt;(Cognizant did not respond to questions about the defibrillator.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QqvhFh&quot;&gt;I believe Chandra and his team will work diligently to improve this system as best as they can. By making vendors like Cognizant accountable for the mental health of their workers for the first time, and offering psychological support to moderators after they leave the company, Facebook can improve the standard of living for contractors across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UlDrqH&quot;&gt;But it remains to be seen how much good Facebook can do while continuing to hold its contractors at arms’ length. Every layer of management between a content moderator and senior Facebook leadership offers another chance for something to go wrong — and to go unseen by anyone with the power to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;BYCsVy&quot;&gt;“Seriously Facebook, if you want to know, if you really care, you can literally call me,” Melynda Johnson told me. “I will tell you ways that I think that you can fix things there. Because I do care. Because I really do not think people should be treated this way. And if you do know what’s going on there, and you’re turning a blind eye, shame on you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;64YE08&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;olSOpl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you worked as a content moderator?

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation to set up a simple macOS VM in QEMU, accelerated by KVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foxletfox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@FoxletFox&lt;/a&gt;, and the help of many others. Find this useful? &lt;a href=&quot;https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/96dc5777-0abf-437d-a9b5-a78ae2c4c227&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;You can donate here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to macOS KVM? Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/FAQs.md&quot;&gt;the FAQs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need a Linux system with &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt; (3.1 or later), &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and the KVM extensions installed for this project. A Mac is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; required. Some examples for different distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install qemu-system qemu-utils python3 python3-pip  # for Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, and PopOS.
sudo pacman -S qemu python python-pip            # for Arch.
sudo xbps-install -Su qemu python3 python3-pip   # for Void Linux.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;jumpstart.sh&lt;/code&gt; to download installation media for macOS (internet required). The default installation uses Catalina, but you can choose which version to get by adding either &lt;code&gt;--high-sierra&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--mojave&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;--catalina&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./jumpstart.sh --mojave
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You can skip this if you already have &lt;code&gt;BaseSystem.img&lt;/code&gt; downloaded. If you have &lt;code&gt;BaseSystem.dmg&lt;/code&gt;, you will need to convert it with the &lt;code&gt;dmg2img&lt;/code&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an empty hard disk using &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt;, changing the name and size to preference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;qemu-img create -f qcow2 MyDisk.qcow2 64G
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and add it to the end of &lt;code&gt;basic.sh&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    -drive id=SystemDisk,if=none,file=MyDisk.qcow2 \
    -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=SystemDisk \
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you're running on a headless system (such as on Cloud providers), you will need &lt;code&gt;-nographic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-vnc :0 -k en-us&lt;/code&gt; for VNC support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;basic.sh&lt;/code&gt; to start the machine and install macOS. Remember to partition in Disk Utility first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2a (Virtual Machine Manager)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead of QEMU, you'd like to import the setup into Virt-Manager for further configuration, just run &lt;code&gt;make.sh --add&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fine-tune the system and improve performance, look in the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; folder for more information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/guide-performance.md&quot;&gt;adding memory&lt;/a&gt;, seting up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/guide-networking.md&quot;&gt;bridged networking&lt;/a&gt;, adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM/blob/master/docs/guide-passthrough.md&quot;&gt;passthrough hardware (for GPUs)&lt;/a&gt;, and enabling sound features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Facebook picked Rust to implement Libra</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/c20aed/facebook_just_picked_rust_to_implement_their_new/erhsz9q/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/c20aed/facebook_just_picked_rust_to_implement_their_new/erhsz9q/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Actually, Monero and Zcash are &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the two most popular privacy coins. Dash is the first and most successful of the privacy coins. And is the &lt;a class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-27 bsbpkS&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coinfairvalue.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest by fair value&lt;/a&gt; and daily transactions. Until about a month ago, Monero only had 2000 transactions per day. Dash routinely sees 15-25,000 transactions per day. Most of Monero's daily transactions are actually fake transactions to hide this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Fair value is a bit different from price in that it attempts to be an &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;objective measure&lt;/strong&gt; of the value stored in blockchains, without relying on exchange data. Exchanges are just websites that trade cryptocurrencies, so their data is not indicative of a particular coin as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Anyway, Monero's privacy was broken from its inception and does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;A former developer for Monero recently stated that its privacy is not 'fit for purpose' (i.e. it doesn't work):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-27 bsbpkS&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/bindps/when_the_fud_finally_fails_and_the_ugly_hot_girl/em92sbz/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/bindps/when_the_fud_finally_fails_and_the_ugly_hot_girl/em92sbz/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-9 gJHxyp&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-9 gJHxyp&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;fireice_uk stated in his article, there's really no way to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-9 gJHxyp&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;I didn't say that. I think it can be fixed, however &lt;em class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-15 eVRrwT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;as is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;Monero's (and all other cryptonotes') privacy is not fit for purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Many researchers have broken Monero's privacy and gotten around its encryption, and as I point out &lt;a class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-27 bsbpkS&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/9ibrh0/cutting_to_the_chase_or_how_to_properly_evaluate/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=CryptoTechnology&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here, Monero has the smallest anonymity set of all the privacy coins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-27 bsbpkS&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-9 gJHxyp&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;The researchers also found a second problem in Monero's untraceability system tied to the timing of transactions. In any mix of one real coin and a set of fake coins bundled up in a transaction, &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;the real one&lt;/strong&gt; is very likely to have been &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;the most recent coin&lt;/strong&gt; to have moved prior to that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-9 gJHxyp&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Before a recent change from Monero's developers, that timing analysis &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;correctly identified the real coin more than 90 percent of the time&lt;/strong&gt;, virtually &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;nullifying Monero's privacy safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;. After that change to how Monero chooses its mixins, that trick now can spot &lt;strong class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-14 gDfnDS&quot;&gt;the real coin just 45 percent of the time—but still narrows down the real coin to about two possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;, far fewer than most Monero users would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s1wjcqzz-10 lkEbBw&quot;&gt;Finally, Dash uses privateSend which is not a third-party mixer, but it kind of is. There are around 5000 masternodes, Dash selects one at random which facilitates the mixing in a trustless and decentralized way. Control of funds never leaves the user.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google to Reimplement Curl in Libcrurl</title>
<link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not the entire thing, just “a subset”. It’s not stated very clearly exactly what that subset is but the easy interface is mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crbug.com/973603&quot;&gt;Chrome bug about this project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chromium bug states that they will create a library of their own (named libcrurl) that will offer (parts of) the libcurl API and be implemented using &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/cronet/&quot;&gt;Cronet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chromium.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12585&quot; width=&quot;239&quot; height=&quot;239&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chromium.png 520w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chromium-200x200.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chromium-450x450.png 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronet is the networking stack of Chromium put into a library for use on mobile. The same networking stack that is used in the Chrome browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a mentioned possibility that “if this works”, they might also create “crurl” tool which is then their own version of the curl tool but using their own library. In itself is a pretty strong indication that their API will not be fully compatible, as if it was they could just use the existing curl tool…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Implementing libcurl using Cronet would allow developers to take advantage of the utility of the Chrome Network Stack, without having to learn a new interface and its corresponding workflow. This would ideally increase ease of accessibility of Cronet, and overall improve adoption of Cronet by first-party or third-party applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, I suppose they then also hope that 3rd party applications can switch to this library (without having to change to another API or adapt much) and gain something and that new applications can use this library without having to learn a new API. Stick to the old established libcurl API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By throwing a lot of man power on it. As the primary author and developer of the libcurl API and the libcurl code, I assume that Cronet works quite differently than libcurl so there’s going to be quite a lot of wrestling of data and code flow to make this API work on that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The libcurl API is also very versatile and is an API that has developed over a period of almost 20 years so there’s a lot of functionality, a lot of options and a lot of subtle behavior that may or may not be easy or straight forward to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1664790&quot;&gt;initial commit&lt;/a&gt; imported the headers and examples from the curl 7.65.1 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting basic functionality for a small set of use cases should be simple and straight forward. But even if they limit the subset to number of functions and libcurl options, making them work exactly as we have them documented will be hard and time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think applications will be able to arbitrarily use either library for a very long time, if ever. libcurl has 80 public functions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html&quot;&gt;curl_easy_setopt&lt;/a&gt; alone takes 268 different options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given enough time and effort they can certainly make this work to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no word on API/ABI stability or how they intend to ship or version their library. It is all very early still. I suppose we will learn more details as and if this progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flattered?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this move underscores that libcurl has succeeded in becoming an almost defacto standard for network transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Google-offices-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5945&quot; width=&quot;241&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Google-offices-logo.jpg 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Google-offices-logo-150x117.jpg 150w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Google-offices-logo-300x234.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px&quot;/&gt;A Google office building in New York.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s this saying about imitation and flattery but getting competition from a giant like Google is a little intimidating. If they just put &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; paid engineers on their project they already have more dedicated man power than the original libcurl project does…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How will it affect curl?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off: this doesn’t seem to actually exist for real yet so it is still very early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the team working on this from Google’s end finds and fixes issues in our code and API so curl improves. Ideally this move makes more users aware of libcurl and its API and we make it even easier for users and applications in the world to do safe and solid Internet transfers. If the engineers are magically good, they offer a library that can do things &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than libcurl can, using the same API so application authors can just pick the library they find work the best. Let the best library win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I think introducing half-baked implementations of the API will cause users grief since it will be hard for users to understand what API it is and how they differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t think “libcrurl” will be able to offer a compatible API without a considerable effort, I think applications will need to be aware of which of the APIs they work with and then we have a “split world” to deal with for the foreseeable future and that will cause problems, documentation problems and users misunderstanding or just getting things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their naming will possibly also be reason for confusion since “libcrurl” and “crurl” look so much like typos of the original names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-1200x459.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8936&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-1200x459.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-200x76.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-450x172.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/good_curl_logo-768x294.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are determined to keep libcurl the transfer library for the internet. We support the &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; API and we offer full backwards compatibility while working the same way on a vast amount of different platforms and architectures. Why use a copy when the original is free, proven and battle-tested since years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rights?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to put things in perspective: yes they’re perfectly allowed and permitted to do this. Both morally and legally. curl is free and open source and licensed under the MIT license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish the team working on this the best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Learn anything by creating something everyday</title>
<link>https://internetvin.com/futureland-alpha/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://internetvin.com/futureland-alpha/</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://hfo.futureland.tv/request_form&quot;&gt;Request Access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-futureland-alpha&quot;&gt;What is Futureland: Alpha?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futureland: Alpha consists of a community of creative self learners, a clean profile to track and display your projects and a file management system to store your projects and download them whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word Alpha is meant to communicate that this is my first draft of Futureland. Only core components have been built so far, but Futureland: Alpha is still a very effective way of learning new skills. Sometimes I use manual processes to more deeply understand Futureland's requirements and this documentation reflects that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futureland: Alpha is currently private which means users are invited to experiment and test the tools. All of this work is building up to a &lt;em&gt;public Beta&lt;/em&gt; of Futureland that anyone on the Internet can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;projects-on-futureland&quot;&gt;Projects on Futureland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Futureland project can be anything from creating a robot, a film, a song, a 3D model, a yoga pose or an app each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must complete and publish your output before sleeping for the day. It is OK to share &quot;mediocre work&quot;, actually this is encouraged as it begins to change your psychological relationship with your work. Making mediocre things is a very important part of learning anything new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;request-access&quot;&gt;Request access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will require an invite to use Futureland: Alpha. To get an invite visit our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hfo.futureland.tv/request_form&quot;&gt;request page&lt;/a&gt;. I am restricting access to a limited set of users because it's important that Futureland is sharp and stable before releasing to the broader public. Once your request has been approved, you will receive an email with a link to join our Slack community.
&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-on-slack&quot;&gt;Built on Slack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futureland uses Slack as a way to chat and share you work with other users. It also acts an interface to update your Futureland profile. All of this is handled using a bot I created called Otis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on top of Slack allows Futureland to provide more value to users without having to independently build every component of its experience. Then through interacting with our users over time I can focus on building only what I know will have a transformative impact on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-a-new-project&quot;&gt;Starting a new project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've gained access to Futureland: Alpha you can start a new project by messaging me (@internetVin). Starting a new project on Futureland is currently a manual process because I want to talk to every user instead of sending them to a form for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a project, you will need to select a discipline you want to focus on for 365 consecutive days and a username for your Futureland profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-an-entry-to-your-profile&quot;&gt;Publishing an entry to your profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing an entry to your profile is very easy using a bot named Otis. Otis serves as the connection between Slack and Futureland. To publish to your profile, just message Otis from desktop or mobile with the file of your entry and that's it. It's on your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otis will then share your entry with the rest of the users in Futureland and ask you if you want to add any notes to your entry. Futureland: Alpha currently supports .jpg, .png, .mp4, .mp3. and .wav formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/clojerl/clojerl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9a4c1921a3c85e14d333e9aaf59ae8755d875646/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f636c6f6a65726c2f636c6f6a65726c2e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Travis&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/clojerl/clojerl.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure implemented on the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building &lt;code&gt;clojerl&lt;/code&gt; requires &lt;em&gt;Erlang/OTP 18+&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/erlang/rebar3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;rebar3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/clojerl/clojerl
cd clojerl
make
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Online REPL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try it out and get a sense of what you can do, you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://try.clojerl.online/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Try Clojerl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local REPL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;make repl&lt;/code&gt; will start the REPL and show its prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Clojure 0.0.0-974.592ad8a
clje.user=&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the REPL it's possible to start evaluating Clojure expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;clje.user=&amp;gt; (map inc (range 10))
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
clje.user=&amp;gt; (doc map)
-------------------------
clojure.core/map
([f] [f coll] [f c1 c2] [f c1 c2 c3] [f c1 c2 c3 &amp;amp; colls])
  Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to
  the set of first items of each coll, followed by applying f to the
  set of second items in each coll, until any one of the colls is
  exhausted.  Any remaining items in other colls are ignored. Function
  f should accept number-of-colls arguments. Returns a transducer when
  no collection is provided.
nil
clje.user=&amp;gt; (doc inc)
-------------------------
clojure.core/inc
([x])
  Returns a number one greater than num.
nil
clje.user=&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some very basic examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojerl/clojerl/blob/master/scripts/examples&quot;&gt;scripts/examples&lt;/a&gt; directory. These are meant to be references on how special forms in Clojure on the BEAM are used and how they sometimes differ from Clojure JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Application Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a very basic example of a web project please check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojerl/example-web-app/&quot;&gt;example-web-app&lt;/a&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Your Own App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build tool for Clojerl project is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/erlang/rebar3&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebar3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the official supported tool in the Erlang community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojerl/rebar3_clojerl&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebar3_clojerl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plugin provides helpful commands to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a basic directory scaffolding for a new project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a REPL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to use this plugin please check the documentation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojerl/rebar3_clojerl&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebar3_clojerl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation and Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more information regarding Clojerl &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojerl.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, like what features does it include and how it differs from Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang is a great language for building safe, reliable and scalable systems. It provides immutable, persistent data structures out of the box and its concurrency semantics are unequalled by any other language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure is a Lisp and as such comes with all the goodies Lisps provide. Apart from these Clojure also introduces powerful abstractions such as protocols, multimethods and seqs, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure was built to simplify the development of concurrent programs and some of its concurrency abstractions could be adapted to Erlang. It is fair to say that combining the power of the Erlang VM with the expressiveness of Clojure could provide an interesting, useful result to make the lives of many programmers simpler and make the world a happier place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interoperability as smooth as possible, just like Clojure proper and ClojureScript do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide most Clojure abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide all Erlang abstractions and toolset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a default OTP library in Clojerl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Personal Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about Erlang (and its VM), Clojure and language implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is an experiment that I hope others will find useful. Regardless of whether it becomes a fully functional implementation of Clojure or not, I will have learned a lot along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QAs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Clojerl?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojerl is an experimental implementation of Clojure on the Erlang VM. Its goal is to leverage the features and abstractions of Clojure that we love (macros, collections, seq, protocols, multimethods, metadata, etc.), with the robustness the Erlang VM provides for building (distributed) systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have you heard about LFE and Joxa?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. LFE and Joxa were each created with very specific and different goals in mind. LFE was born to provide a LISP syntax for Erlang. Joxa was mainly created as a platform for creating DSLs that could take advantage of the Erlang VM. Its syntax was inspired by Clojure but the creators weren't interested in implementing all of Clojure's features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aren't the language constructs for concurrency very different between Clojure and Erlang?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are. On one hand Clojure provides tools to handle mutable state in a sane way, while making a clear distinction between identity and state through reference types. On the other, concurrency in the Erlang VM is implemented through processes and message passing. The idea in Clojerl is to encourage the Erlang/OTP concurrency model, but support as many Clojure constructs as possible and as far as they make sense in the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But... but... Rich Hickey lists &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/about/state#actors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; some of the reasons why he chose not to use the actor model in Clojure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not a question, but I see what you mean :). The points he makes are of course very good. For example, when no state is shared between processes there is some communication overhead, but this isolation is also an advantage under a lot of circumstances. He also mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/clojure/Kisk_-9dFjE/_2WxSxyd1SoJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that building for the distributed case (a.k.a processes and message passing) is more complex and not always necessary, so he decided to optimise for the non-distributed case and add distribution to the parts of the system that need it. Rich Hickey calls Erlang &quot;quite impressive&quot;, so my interpretation of these writings is that they are more about exposing the rationale behind the decisions and the trade-offs he made when designing Clojure (on the JVM), than about disregarding the actor model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will Clojerl support every single Clojure feature?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Some of Clojure's features are implemented by relying on the underlying mutability of the JVM and its object system. The Erlang VM provides very few mutability constructs and no support for defining new types. This makes it very hard or nearly impossible to port some features into Clojerl's implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can I reuse existing Clojure(Script) libraries?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but they will need to be ported, just like for ClojureScript. In fact, most of Clojure's core namespaces were ported from the original .clj files in the Clojure JVM repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jfacorro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or lurking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/clojure&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/erlang-programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt;'s mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any feedback, comment and/or suggestion is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
