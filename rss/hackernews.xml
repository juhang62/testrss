&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday it was pausing advertising on Facebook Inc following widespread support for a campaign that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable,” a Verizon representative said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon joins a list of U.S. companies that have stopped advertising on Facebook in support of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, started by several U.S. civil rights groups, even as Facebook worked to contain the growing revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream brand Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s and outdoor gear companies Patagonia and The North Face are among 10 brands that previously said they would suspend ads on the social media site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said it is working with civil rights organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We respect any brand’s decision and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information,” said Carolyn Everson, vice president of global business for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blackballed by PayPal, Sci-Hub switches to Bitcoin</title>
<link>https://www.coindesk.com/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.coindesk.com/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;node-0&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;A quiet rebellion against copyright is being waged on a single website by a freelance coder, using cryptocurrency where PayPal won’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;node-1&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;28.962962962963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/how-i-missed-the-point-of-bitcoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;censorship-free money&lt;/a&gt; has been used by outlaws of all sorts, but this time the outlaw is a young scientist from Kazakhstan breaking through the paywalls of academic journals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-2&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Alexandra Elbakyan, a 31-year-old freelance coder, neurobiologist and phylologist, is running a database of over 80 million articles from academic journals that are normally available only through subscriptions. What started out of frustration when she was a graduate student became a free research service funded only through donations. For most people in the world, bitcoin is the only way to support Elbakyan’s work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-3&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35.738636363636&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The website, called Sci-Hub, has been sued by two science publishing houses and reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-investigates-sci-hub-founder-on-suspicion-of-working-for-russian-intelligence/2019/12/19/9dbcb6e6-2277-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible espionage on behalf of Russian intelligence. (Elbakyan said she never got contacted by the U.S. authorities about it.) This effectively cut Elbakyan off the mainstream financial services in the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-4&quot; class=&quot;inline-image-v2 default&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;668&quot; height=&quot;788&quot; src=&quot;https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-19-at-2.56.50-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;screen-shot-2020-06-19-at-2-56-50-pm&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;small&gt;NEVERMORE? &quot;The law and morality don't always match up, and they certainly don't in this case,” says an admirer of Sci-Hub, whose logo is depicted above.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Sci-Hub&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-5&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Elbakyan told CoinDesk the website sees about 600,000 visits each day. Even for those researchers who have access to subscriptions via universities, Sci-Hub turns out to be the most convenient option to get content for their research, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-6&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;But her struggles underscore one of the fundamental value propositions of cryptocurrency: When people can’t use the mainstream payment ralis, crypto offers an alternative. It’s hardly a bellwether of a broad adoption coming, but it is “a good example of bitcoin as a niche payments rail,” economist John Paul Koning told CoinDesk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-7&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38.243902439024&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“For most purposes, people prefer to use regular fiat payments because they are easy,” said Koning, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/author/jpkoning&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;CoinDesk columnist&lt;/a&gt;. “But when they get locked out, either because they are engaging in illegal activities or legal ones that are deemed socially unacceptable, bitcoin becomes an option. People who have been locked out of these conventional systems are slowly discovering that bitcoin can serve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-8&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;4.6376811594203&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tearing-down-monuments-isnt-censorship-its-speech&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tearing Down Monuments Isn’t Censorship – It’s Speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-9&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Elbakyan says bitcoin only constitutes a small part of all donations. Most often, it’s the online payment service Yandex.Money that is available in Russia and nearby countries including Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. However, for all the other parts of the world, crypto is the only direct way to support Sci-Hub.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-10&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;33.402777777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Sometimes, that can be an issue. Still few people trust bitcoin, Elbakyan says, and some countries prohibit crypto, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/bolivias-central-bank-bans-bitcoin-digital-currencies&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/use-bitcoin-ecuador-grow-government-ban/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-11&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“Somebody wrote to me recently saying that in his country only drug addicts use bitcoin, and asked if there were any other ways to donate,” Elbakyan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-12&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38.31338028169&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In 2018, University of Pennsylvania postdoctoral fellow Daniel Himmelstein and a group of other scholars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832410/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Sci-Hub raised more than 94 bitcoin, worth about $900,000 at recent prices, before 2018. Speaking with CoinDesk, Elbakyan confirmed that the estimate was mostly fair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-13&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36.646884272997&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The 2017 bitcoin rally was a good moment for her, Elbakyan says, as she could sell some bitcoin at a high price. But otherwise she’s nonchalant about all things blockchain and distributed tech. When asked if distributed file storage solutions currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/filecoin-prepares-for-network-launch-with-final-testing-phase&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;in the works&lt;/a&gt; could be useful for Sci-Hub, she says the site works fine as it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Access denied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-15&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38.426470588235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Elbakyan’s clash with the publishing industry cost her the ability to use any U.S.-based services. In 2015, Dutch science publishing house Elsevier, a publisher of 2,500 science journals, including The Lancet and ScienceDirect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355308/1/elsevier-inc-v-sci-hub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Sci-Hub for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-16&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37.729641693811&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In 2017, a federal court, the U.S. Southern District Court of New York, sided with Elsevier and ruled Sci-Hub should stop operating and pay $15 million in damages. In a similar lawsuit, the American Chemistry Society &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/pirate-paper-website-sci-hub-dealt-another-blow-by-us-courts-1.22971&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;won a case&lt;/a&gt; against Elbakyan and the right to demand another $4.8 million in damages.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-17&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In addition, both courts effectively prohibited any U.S. company from facilitating Sci-Hub’s work. Elbakyan had to migrate the website from its early .org domain, and the U.S.-based online payment services are no longer an option for her. She can no longer use Cloudflare, a service that protects websites from denial-of-service attacks, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-18&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“When I opened a PayPal account, the donations would hit every minute. But after one day the wallet would get frozen,” Elbakyan said. She showed CoinDesk an email from PayPal in 2013, in which the company notified Elbakyan that Elsevier reported her for copyright infringement and she should either remove the violating materials from Sci-Hub or remove PayPal as a donation option.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-19&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;3.6559139784946&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/the-decentralized-web-has-plans-if-not-solutions-to-the-misinformation-nightmare&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-20&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“Payment processors are increasingly taking a keen interest in what their users are doing with their services; even going as far as banning political figures who they might disapprove of,” says Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-21&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“In this world of politicized payment rails, the existence of a neutral alternative that treats everyone equally is a godsend,” Carter said, referring to bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-22&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;PayPal’s press office did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-23&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;So now researchers in the U.S. who, just like Elbakyan, can’t afford costly subscriptions to access scientific content, can only thank her by using bitcoin. And they are using Sci-Hub, data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-24&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36.362068965517&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Himmelstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832410/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Sci-Hub has been steadily growing in popularity since its inception in 2011, going from 185,243 downloads per day in February 2016 to 458,589 in 2017. The researchers found Sci-Hub usage has exceeded that of the University of Pennsylvania online library twentyfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Academic lifeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-26&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;As she was speaking to CoinDesk, 30 papers were being downloaded over the course of  three minutes, Elbakyan said, adding that during the busiest hours, there can be thousands of papers downloaded in the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-27&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“If you’re working from home, you need to access the university’s server first. And many people told me that they needed to click through multiple links and even then the paper wouldn’t open up – this is how clumsy the legal access is,” Elbakyan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-28&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37.547277936963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;She first got frustrated with the cost of academic knowledge as a student, working on her graduate paper, Elbakyan wrote in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://sci-hub.tw/alexandra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;autobiography&lt;/a&gt; on Sci-Hub. When she was a teenager she hacked websites for fun. When she was 16 she created a script allowing her to download books from the MIT CogNet website for free, despite the paywall, Elbakyan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Back then, she would rely on the network of researchers who would share papers they had access to via an online forum, she said in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://newtonew.com/hero/sci-hub-against-information-inequality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the website Newtonew. Then, she decided to create an automatically updating database of academic knowledge, which became Sci-Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-30&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The website is using other researchers’ credentials for university proxy servers – Elbakyan won’t say how exactly she gets the credentials – and automatically downloading papers onto Sci-Hub’s server, where people can find them using a web address or unique identifier of a paper they need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Most people don’t care’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-32&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Elbakyan is maintaining the website alone, believing it’s the safest way. “If you have a team, it can fall apart at some point, or you might have a mole,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-33&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;But while she doesn’t need more people working on Sci-Hub, she would love to see a widespread discussion about free access to academic knowledge, she says. A self-described Communist in her political views, Elbakyan believes the paywall policy of science publishing is a kind of censorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-34&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;34.603351955307&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“I had a dream that Sci-Hub gets discussed by the U.N.,” Elbakyan said, referring to the United Nations. “For example, Russia could tell the U.S. that it’s a violation of human rights [to ban Sci-Hub] because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;U.N. Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; says everyone has the right to participate in scientific advancement. But that remained only a dream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-35&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;4.5070422535211&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/the-new-york-times-proves-why-civils-vision-is-still-vital&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The New York Times Proves Why Civil’s Vision Is Still Vital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-36&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Elbakyan says she hasn’t approached any political parties or government bodies, thinking they could pick up on the censorship argument if they were interested. She does not believe most people are interested in discussing freedom of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-37&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;38.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“There is no real community to discuss that, you hardly hear such voices. Not just in the mainstream media, but even on YouTube, for example. It all died by 2013, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-brilliant-life-and-tragic-death-of-aaron-swartz-177191/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; died,” she said, adding that even though many people are using her website or pirate websites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-torrent-tracker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;torrent trackers&lt;/a&gt;, few care how and why they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-38&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;“People don’t think about the [copyright] laws, about doing something about it or voting against it,” Elbakyan says. “When people reach out to me, they usually write to say ‘thank you’ or ask how to better donate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;node-39&quot; class=&quot;article-pharagraph&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub’s standoff with the publishing industry is a good fight, Carter (who is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/author/nic-carter&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;CoinDesk columnist&lt;/a&gt;) believes. “The law and morality don’t always match up, and they certainly don’t in this case,” he said, adding:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Olympus was a major player in the film and early digital days, with products like this 1970s 35mm camera
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Olympus, once one of the world's biggest camera brands, is selling off that part of its business after 84 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said that despite its best efforts, the &quot;extremely severe digital camera market&quot; was no longer profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of smartphones, which had shrunk the market for separate cameras, was one major factor, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had recorded losses for the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese company made its first camera in 1936 after years of microscope manufacture. The Semi-Olympus I featured an accordion-like fold-out camera bellows, and cost more than a month's wages in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company continued to develop the camera business over the decades, becoming one of the top companies by market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a huge amount of affection for Olympus, going right back,&quot; says Nigel Atherton, editor of Amateur Photographer magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1970s was a high point, with their cameras advertised on television by celebrity photographers such as David Bailey and Lord Lichfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those cameras were revolutionary - they were very small, very light, they were beautifully designed, had really nice quality lenses,&quot; adds Atherton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cult following stayed with the firm, despite teething issues with new technologies such as autofocus, Atherton says. But the firm had a second wave with digital cameras, where they were early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they targeted their later range of mirrorless cameras at a middle market - &quot;people who weren't serious photographers - they wanted something better than a point-and-shoot camera, but they didn't want a DSLR camera&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That market very very quickly got swallowed up by smartphones, and turned out not to exist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for standalone cameras has fallen dramatically - &lt;a href=&quot;https://lensvid.com/gear/technology/what-happened-to-the-photography-industry-in-2018/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;by one estimate, it dropped by 84% between 2010 and 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    This 2-megapixel camera from 2000 could connect to a mobile phone to send images
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Olympus I find a very frustrating company,&quot; Atherton says. &quot;Continually over the last few years, they've constantly got it wrong, made wrong decisions, taken wrong turns, and gone down cul-de-sacs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example he cited was the lack of progress in video performance, where rivals have made strides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39741921&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;a major financial scandal involving senior executives in 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympus is now seeking to strike a deal to carve off the camera part of its business so that its brands - such as Zuiko lenses - can be used in new products by another firm, Japan Industrial Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Japanese company said that it was business as usual until then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe this is the right step to preserve the legacy of the brand,&quot; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On social media, however, its UK team accepted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OlympusUK/photos/a.136244383085852/3215719021805024/?type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;fans &quot;may have many questions&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We ask for your patience... Olympus sees this potential transfer as an opportunity to enable our imaging business to grow and delight both long-time and new photography enthusiasts,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympus Corporation, however, will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company never stopped making microscopes, and has turned its optical technology to other scientific and medical equipment such as endoscopes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Comcast, Mozilla strike privacy deal to encrypt DNS lookups in Firefox</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast is partnering with Mozilla to deploy encrypted DNS lookups on the Firefox browser, the companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/06/25/comcasts-xfinity-internet-service-joins-firefoxs-trusted-recursive-resolver-program/&quot;&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Comcast's version of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) will be turned on by default for Firefox users on Comcast's broadband network, but people will be able to switch to other options like Cloudflare and NextDNS. No availability date was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast is the first ISP to join Firefox's Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) program, Mozilla said in today's announcement. Cloudflare and NextDNS were &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/12/17/firefox-announces-new-partner-in-delivering-private-and-secure-dns-services-to-users&quot;&gt;already in Mozilla's program&lt;/a&gt;, which requires encrypted-DNS providers to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy&quot;&gt;privacy and transparency criteria&lt;/a&gt; and pledge not to block or filter domains by default &quot;unless specifically required by law in the jurisdiction in which the resolver operates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adding ISPs in the TRR program paves the way for providing customers with the security of trusted DNS resolution, while also offering the benefits of a resolver provided by their ISP such as parental control services and better optimized, localized results,&quot; the announcement said. &quot;Mozilla and Comcast will be jointly running tests to inform how Firefox can assign the best available TRR to each user.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox CTO Eric Rescorla said that &quot;bringing ISPs into the TRR program helps us protect user privacy online without disrupting existing user experiences,&quot; and that Mozilla hopes today's news &quot;sets a precedent for further cooperation between browsers and ISPs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining Mozilla's program means that Comcast agreed that it won't &quot;retain, sell, or transfer to any third party (except as may be required by law) any personal information, IP addresses, or other user identifiers, or user query patterns from the DNS queries sent from the Firefox browser,&quot; along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy#Privacy_Requirements&quot;&gt;other requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Mozilla noted in today's announcement that encrypting DNS is &quot;the first step&quot; toward privacy, and not the only necessary step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox started providing DNS over HTTPS (DoH) by default with Cloudflare to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/firefox-turns-encrypted-dns-on-by-default-to-thwart-snooping-isps/&quot;&gt;US-based users in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla and Comcast haven't said exactly when Comcast's encrypted DNS will be available on Firefox. Whenever it happens, the change should be automatic for users unless they've chosen a different DoH provider or disabled DoH altogether. Comcast told Ars yesterday that &quot;Firefox users on Xfinity should automatically default to Xfinity resolvers under Mozilla's Trusted Recursive Resolver program, unless they have manually chosen a different resolver, or if DoH is disabled. The precise mechanism is still being tested and the companies plan to document it soon in an IETF [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/a&gt;] Draft.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla told Ars that Comcast's DoH in Firefox will be &quot;opt-out,&quot; meaning that it will be possible to switch from Comcast to Cloudflare or NextDNS. Instructions for switching encrypted-DNS providers in Firefox are &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_manually-enabling-and-disabling-dns-over-https&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mozilla, Comcast previously fought over DNS plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS over HTTPS helps keep eavesdroppers from seeing what DNS lookups your browser is making. This can make it more difficult for ISPs or other third parties to monitor what websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comcast/Mozilla partnership is notable because ISPs have fought plans to deploy DNS over HTTPS in browsers, and Mozilla's work on the technology is largely intended to prevent ISPs from snooping on their users' browsing. In September 2019, industry groups including the NCTA cable lobby that Comcast belongs to wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncta.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/Final%20DOH%20LETTER%209-19-19.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Congress &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/isps-worry-a-new-chrome-feature-will-stop-them-from-spying-on-you/&quot;&gt;objecting to Google's plans&lt;/a&gt; for encrypted DNS in Chrome and Android. Comcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/comcast-fights-googles-encrypted-dns-plan-but-promises-not-to-spy-on-users/&quot;&gt;gave members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6509454/ISP-DoH-Lobbying-Slide-Deck.pdf&quot;&gt;lobbying presentation&lt;/a&gt; that claimed the encrypted-DNS plan would &quot;centraliz[e] a majority of worldwide DNS data with Google&quot; and &quot;give one provider control of Internet traffic routing and vast amounts of new data about consumers and competitors.&quot; Comcast's lobbying presentation also complained about Mozilla's plan for Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla in November &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/isps-lied-to-congress-to-spread-confusion-about-encrypted-dns-mozilla-says/&quot;&gt;accused ISPs&lt;/a&gt; of lying to Congress in order to spread confusion about encrypted DNS. Mozilla's &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mozilla-to-congress-dns-https.pdf&quot;&gt;letter to Congress&lt;/a&gt; criticized Comcast, pointing to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;incident in 2014&lt;/a&gt; in which Comcast &quot;injected ads to users connected to its public Wi-Fi hotspots, potentially creating new security vulnerabilities in websites.&quot; Mozilla said that because of the Comcast incident and others involving Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, &quot;We believe that such proactive measures [to implement encrypted DNS] have become necessary to protect users in light of the extensive record of ISP abuse of personal data.&quot; Mozilla also pointed out the country's lack of broadband privacy rules, which were &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/for-sale-your-private-browsing-history/&quot;&gt;killed by Congress&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 at the request of ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mozilla moved ahead with plans to automatically switch Firefox users to encrypted DNS providers such as Cloudflare, Comcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/privacy-with-comcasts-xfinity-internet-service&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it does not track its broadband users' Web browsing histories and launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/update-on-comcasts-encrypted-dns-plans&quot;&gt;public beta&lt;/a&gt; of its own version of DNS over HTTPS. Eventually, they began working together. &quot;Comcast and Mozilla have been discussing DNS encryption since 2019 and signed an agreement to deploy DoH to Firefox users on Comcast networks in March 2020,&quot; Mozilla told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast's encrypted DNS should also be coming to Chrome at some point. Comcast is part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/dns-over-https&quot;&gt;Chromium's DNS over HTTPS beta&lt;/a&gt; program, along with Cloudflare, OpenDNS, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Symbian Won</title>
<link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/06/symbian-won/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/06/symbian-won/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was working in the mobile phone industry just as smartphones were taking off. I saw the Palm Pilot rise and fall. I witnessed NEC and Sagem and a host of companies launch smartphones and then disappear. But the greatest tragedy of them all was Nokia and their Symbian Operating System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Actually, Symbian’s ownership and relationship with Nokia is complex. But let’s gloss over that for now.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbian was, for its time, a brilliant OS. It ran 3D games smoothly, had terrific hardware support, a decent ecosystem for developers. And it was bloody annoying for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every few minutes, Symbian would interrupt you to ask “Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; you want this app to connect to the Internet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Symbian-Internet-Permission-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Early mobile phone asking for permission to access the Internet.&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; sure that you want it to connect to a secure site?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Symbian-Secure-Connection-prompt.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Opening a secure connection. Yes or No?&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28201&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would you like me to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to remember your choice?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Symbian-Internet-Permission.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Network access. Ask every time, disallow, ask first time?&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28199&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On and on it went. And then, with great fanfare, Apple and Google disrupted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s model was “We have a curated store of artisanal apps, each one backed up by a legal entity with a DUNS number. We check them so you don’t have to. Everything on our store is trustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s model was “We’ll tell you what kind of crap this app will use. Don’t like it? Don’t use it! YOLO!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, led to ostensibly harmless apps asking for ridiculously invasive permissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Legit-App-Permissions.png&quot; alt=&quot;A terrifying list of permissions.&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-28202&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, as it turns out, a Libertarian free-for-all doesn’t work. It requires rational people to have an educated understanding of the risks they face. Millions of people installed dodgy apps, saw the one-time prompt, and lost control of their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the latest releases of Android and iOS, we’re back to where we started. Both now prompt you the first time an app asks for access. Both give you regular reminders of which apps may be snaffling your data. Both let you manage access and selectively deny apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many (many!) reasons why Symbian lost the Great Mobile Wars. But it is somehow fitting to see the return of design decisions they made decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Julian Assange charged in superseding indictment</title>
<link>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wikileaks-founder-charged-superseding-indictment</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wikileaks-founder-charged-superseding-indictment</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment today charging Julian P. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, with offenses that relate to Assange’s alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new indictment does not add additional counts to the prior 18-count superseding indictment returned against Assange in May 2019.  It does, however, broaden the scope of the conspiracy surrounding alleged computer intrusions with which Assange was previously charged.  According to the charging document, Assange and others at WikiLeaks recruited and agreed with hackers to commit computer intrusions to benefit WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of WikiLeaks, Assange has spoken at hacking conferences to tout his own history as a “famous teenage hacker in Australia” and to encourage others to hack to obtain information for WikiLeaks.  In 2009, for instance, Assange told the Hacking At Random conference that WikiLeaks had obtained nonpublic documents from the Congressional Research Service by exploiting “a small vulnerability” inside the document distribution system of the United States Congress, and then asserted that “[t]his is what any one of you would find if you were actually looking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Assange gained unauthorized access to a government computer system of a NATO country.  In 2012, Assange communicated directly with a leader of the hacking group LulzSec (who by then was cooperating with the FBI), and provided a list of targets for LulzSec to hack.  With respect to one target, Assange asked the LulzSec leader to look for (and provide to WikiLeaks) mail and documents, databases and pdfs.  In another communication, Assange told the LulzSec leader that the most impactful release of hacked materials would be from the CIA, NSA, or the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.  WikiLeaks obtained and published emails from a data breach committed against an American intelligence consulting company by an “Anonymous” and LulzSec-affiliated hacker.  According to that hacker, Assange indirectly asked him to spam that victim company again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the broadened hacking conspiracy continues to allege that Assange conspired with Army Intelligence Analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password hash to a classified U.S. Department of Defense computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.  Assange is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count except for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, for which he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and James A. Dawson, Special Agent in Charge, Criminal Division, FBI Washington Field Office, made the announcement. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S. Dwyer, Thomas W. Traxler, Alexander P. Berrang, and Gordon D. Kromberg, and Trial Attorneys Adam L. Small and Nicholas O. Hunter of the Justice Department’s National Security Division are prosecuting the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange is currently detained in the United Kingdom on an extradition request from the United States.  Assange’s extradition to the United States is being handled by the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and UK authorities, including the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service for England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wirecard files for insolvency after financial hole laid bare</title>
<link>https://www.dw.com/en/wirecard-files-for-insolvency-after-financial-hole-laid-bare/a-53936447</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dw.com/en/wirecard-files-for-insolvency-after-financial-hole-laid-bare/a-53936447</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;German financial technology firm Wirecard announced Thursday it would file for insolvency amid an accounting scandal that led earlier this week to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/former-wirecard-ceo-markus-braun-arrested/a-53905720&quot;&gt;the arrest of its former CEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it was making the filing &quot;due to impending insolvency and debt.&quot; It will make the filing at a district court in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more:&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/scandal-hit-german-fintech-wirecard-secures-1-billion-investment/a-48463541&quot;&gt;Scandal-hit German fintech Wirecard secures $1 billion investment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markus Braun resigned as CEO on Friday after the company could not find roughly €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) that appeared in its accounts. Braun later turned himself in to prosecutors after Wirecard concluded that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/wirecards-missing-billions-not-in-the-philippines-central-bank-says/a-53892369&quot;&gt;the money probably never existed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading in the group's shares was immediately halted by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, leaving them blocked at €10.74, down 12.7% from close of trading Wednesday. Prior to the sudden scandal, it was trading just over €100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard has become the first member of DAX, Germany's blue-chip share index, to go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich prosecutor's office, which is already investigating Braun on suspicion of manipulating Wirecard&quot;s accounts, said &quot;We will now look at all possible criminal offenses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following his arrest, Braun has been released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did Wirecard become insolvent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard had been one of Germany's fastest-growing tech firms and was set to be a new giant in the business. The scandal has also raised questions about Germany's ability to implement corporate regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media reports in 2019 questioned the company’s accounting, but Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, targeted investors instead of the firm itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BaFin has described events this week surrounding Wirecard as a &quot;disaster&quot; but also said that it stands by its decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard had been a member of the DAX index for less than two years and at its peak was worth €25 billion ($28 billion) by market capitaliztion.&lt;/p&gt;
