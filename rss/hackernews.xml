<title>Article 13 Is Back On: Worse, Not Better</title>
<link>https://juliareda.eu/2019/02/article-13-worse/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://juliareda.eu/2019/02/article-13-worse/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs recall: On January 18, &lt;strong&gt;negotiations about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new EU copyright law&lt;/a&gt; came to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2019/01/copyright-hits_wall/&quot;&gt;abrupt halt&lt;/a&gt;¬†&lt;/strong&gt;after member state governments failed to settle on a common position on Article 13, which would force internet platforms to censor their users‚Äô posts using upload filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without such an agreement, the final ‚Äú&lt;abbr class=&quot;c2c-text-hover&quot; title=&quot;Informal meetings attended by representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission&quot;&gt;trilogue&lt;/abbr&gt;‚Äù meeting, at which the law was supposed to be finalised together with representatives of the European Parliament, had to be called off ‚Äì and time was running out, with EU elections that will reshuffle all the cards looming in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to some reports, though, &lt;strong&gt;Article 13 was not shelved¬†because a majority of EU governments have come to understand that upload filters are costly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2017/09/when-filters-fail/&quot;&gt;error-prone&lt;/a&gt; and threaten fundamental rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without doubt, the¬†unprecedented¬†&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet&quot;&gt;public opposition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; contributed to 11 member state governments voting against proceeding, up from just 6 last year. Still, there remained a &lt;strong&gt;majority in favour of Article 13 in general&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì just disagreement about details. This has now been resolved, and the process of enacting the law is back in motion ‚Äì read on below.&lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-10927&quot; src=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1276&quot; height=&quot;724&quot; srcset=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded.jpg 1276w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded-300x170.jpg 300w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded-768x436.jpg 768w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/copyright-keyhole-eu-reloaded-600x340.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1276px) 100vw, 1276px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An agreement required¬†&lt;strong&gt;a compromise between France and Germany&lt;/strong&gt;, who due to their size can make or break a majority. &lt;strong&gt;Both support upload filters ‚Äì&lt;/strong&gt; they just couldn‚Äôt agree on exactly who should be forced to install them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;üá´üá∑¬† France‚Äôs position:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 13 is great and must apply to &lt;strong&gt;all platforms, regardless of size&lt;/strong&gt;. They must demonstrate that they have done all they possibly could to prevent uploads of copyrighted material. In the case of small businesses, that may or may not mean using upload filters ‚Äì ultimately, a court would have to make that call.&lt;br/&gt;(This was previously the &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2018/10/copyright-trilogue-positions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;majority position among EU governments&lt;/a&gt;, before Italy‚Äôs newly elected government retracted their support for Article 13 altogether.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;üá©üá™¬†Germany‚Äôs position:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 13 is great, but it &lt;strong&gt;should not apply to everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies with a turnover below ‚Ç¨20 million per year should be excluded outright, so as not to harm European internet startups and SMEs.&lt;br/&gt;(This was closer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2018/10/copyright-trilogue-positions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European Parliament‚Äôs current position&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for the exclusion of companies with a turnover below ‚Ç¨10 million and fewer than 50 employees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What brought them together: Making Article 13 even worse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mandate-Romania-February-8.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Franco-German deal [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;, which leaked today, Article 13 does apply to all for-profit platforms. &lt;strong&gt;Upload filters must be installed by everyone&lt;/strong&gt; except those services which fit all three of the following extremely narrow criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;countdown&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available to the public for less than 3 years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annual turnover below ‚Ç¨10 million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fewer than 5 million unique monthly visitors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless apps and sites that do not meet all these criteria would need to install upload filters, burdening their users and operators, even when copyright infringement is not at all currently a problem for them. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Upload filters required&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discussion boards on commercial sites, such as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heise.de&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/strong&gt; (older than 3 years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patreon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a platform with the sole purpose of helping authors get paid (fails to meet any of the three criteria)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Niche social networks like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GetReeled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a platform for anglers (well below 5 million users, but older than 3 years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small European competitors to larger US brands like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wykop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a Polish news sharing platform similar to &lt;em&gt;Reddit&lt;/em&gt; (well below ‚Ç¨10 million turnover, but may reach 5 million visitors and is older than 3 years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, even the smallest and newest platforms, which do meet all three criteria, must still demonstrate they have undertaken &lt;strong&gt;‚Äúbest efforts‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¬†to obtain licenses&lt;/strong&gt; from rightholders such as record labels, book publishers and stock photo databases for anything their users might possibly post or upload ‚Äì an impossible task. In practice, all sites and apps where users may share content will likely be &lt;strong&gt;forced to accept any&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;license a rightholder offers them&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter how bad the terms, and no matter whether they actually want that rightholder‚Äôs copyrighted material to be available on their platform, to avoid the massive legal risk of coming in conflict with Article 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;France‚Äôs and Germany‚Äôs compromise on Article 13 still calls for nearly everything we post or share online to require &lt;strong&gt;prior permission by ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/censorship-machines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;censorship machines&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù,¬†&lt;/strong&gt;algorithms that are fundamentally unable to distinguish between copyright infringement and legal works such as parody and critique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would change the web from a place where we can express ourselves (with some moderation applied after-the-fact on platforms) into one where &lt;strong&gt;big corporate rightholders are the gatekeepers of what can and can‚Äôt be published in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt; It would allow these rightholders to bully any commercial site or app that includes a posting function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European &lt;strong&gt;innovation on the web would be discouraged&lt;/strong&gt; by the new costs and legal risks for startups ‚Äì even if they only apply when platforms turn 3 years old, or achieve some success. Foreign sites and apps who can‚Äôt afford armies of lawyers would be incentivised to just &lt;strong&gt;geoblock all EU-based users&lt;/strong&gt; to be on the safe side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now everything hinges on the European Parliament&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this road block out of the way, the &lt;strong&gt;trilogue negotiations to finish the new copyright law are back on.&lt;/strong&gt; With no time to lose, there will be massive pressure to reach an overall agreement within the next few days and pass the law in March or April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, Germany‚Äôs and France‚Äôs compromise will be rubber-stamped by the Council on Friday, 8 February, and then a &lt;strong&gt;final trilogue negotiation will take place with the Parliament on Monday, 11 February.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEPs, most of whom are fighting for reelection, will get one final say.&lt;/strong&gt; Last September, a narrow majority for Article 13 could only be found in the Parliament after a small business exception was included that was much stronger than the foul deal France and Germany are now proposing ‚Äì but there‚Äôs unfortunately no reason to believe that Parliament negotiator Axel Voss will stand his ground and insist on this point in trialogue. Instead, it will come down to the final vote in the plenary in March or April, where all MEPs have a say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether MEPs will reject this harmful version of Article 13 (like they initially did last July) or bow to the pressure will depend on whether all of us make clear to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big&quot; readability=&quot;5.1951219512195&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you break the internet and enact Article 13, we won‚Äôt reelect you.&lt;a class=&quot;tweetthis&quot; href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2019/02/article-13-worse/#&quot; data-tweet=&quot;Dear @Europarl_EN MEPs: If you break the internet and enact #Article13, we won‚Äôt reelect you. #SaveYourInternet&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:return tweet(this);&quot;&gt;Tweet this!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just got back from braving the snow in Brussels at¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2019&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì Europe‚Äôs biggest Open Source conference. I think it‚Äôs fair to say we had an amazing time, with more people than ever before wanting to hang out and talk Matrix and discuss their favourite features (and bugs)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news is that¬†&lt;strong&gt;we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html&quot;&gt;r0.1 of Matrix‚Äôs Server-Server API&lt;/a&gt;¬†&lt;/strong&gt;late on Friday night ‚Äì our first ever formal stable release of Matrix‚Äôs Federation API, having addressed the core of the issues which have kept Federation in beta thus far. We‚Äôll go into more detail on this in a dedicated blog post, but this marks the first ever time that¬†&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of Matrix‚Äôs APIs have had an official stable release.¬† All that remains before we declare Matrix out of beta is to release updates of the CS API (0.5) and possibly the IS API (0.2) and then we can formally declare the overall combination as Matrix 1.0 :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke about SS API r0.1 at length in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix_french_state/&quot;&gt;our main stage FOSDEM talk¬†&lt;/a&gt;on Saturday ‚Äì as well as showing off the Riot Redesign, the E2E Encryption Endgame and giving an update on the French Government deployment of Matrix and the focus it‚Äôs given us on finally shipping Matrix 1.0! For those who weren‚Äôt there or missed the livestream, here‚Äôs the talk!¬†¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-01-FOSDEM-Matrix-1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;Slides are available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So sorry for practically yanking you offstage in the end! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/idshDcSRhv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/idshDcSRhv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, on Sunday we had the opportunity to have a quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/&quot;&gt;20 minute talk in the Real Time Comms dev room&lt;/a&gt;, where we gave a tour of some of the work we‚Äôve been doing recently to scale Matrix down to working on incredibly low bandwidth networks (100bps or less).¬† It‚Äôs literally the opposite of the Matrix 1.0 / France talk in that it‚Äôs a quick deep dive into a very specific problem area in Matrix ‚Äì so, if you‚Äôve been¬†looking forward to Matrix finally having a better transport than HTTPS+JSON, here goes!¬† &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf&quot;&gt;Slides are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who came to the talks, and everyone who came to the stand or grabbed us for a chat! FOSDEM is an amazing way to be reminded in person that folks care about Matrix, and we‚Äôve come away feeling more determined than ever to make Matrix as great as possible and provide a protocol+network which will replace the increasingly threatened proprietary communication silos. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Matrix 1.0‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‚ÄúLambda and serverless is one of the worst forms of proprietary lock-in‚Äù (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/06/coreos_kubernetes_v_world/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/06/coreos_kubernetes_v_world/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Interview&lt;/strong&gt; Toward the end of this month, CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi expects Amazon will introduce a managed Kubernetes service at its AWS re:Invent event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so ‚Äì CoreOS CTO Brandon Philips cites some Kubernetes bug reports from Amazon as evidence ‚Äì it will be an admission of what most people focused on software containers already know: that Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Docker's announcement last month that it will support Kubernetes in its enterprise product, Amazon is the largest major cloud vendor that hasn't yet made a serious commitment to the Google-spawned &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/&quot;&gt;open-source project&lt;/a&gt;. It did however tip its hand by joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which oversees Kubernetes, in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kubernetes has clearly won the space,&quot; said Polvi during lunch with &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; and other tech press at its San Francisco, California, headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polvi and Philips anticipate a Kubernetes colonization race, as enterprise vendors scramble to create the management layer for running containerized IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoreOS is already on its way, with its &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/23/coreos_tectonic_now_on_azure_openstack/&quot;&gt;Tectonic&lt;/a&gt; enterprise Kubernetes platform. So is Red Hat, with OpenShift. Google has GKE. Microsoft has AKS. IBM is offering its Bluemix, er, Cloud Container Service. Pivotal has PKS. Oracle has teamed with CoreOS. Cloud Foundry has Cloud Foundry Container Runtime. Cisco too has thrown its hat into the ring through a Google partnership. And the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What Kubernetes really solves is how do you run a ton of different applications with a consistent model,&quot; said Polvi. &quot;That consistency is what allows a company with 20,000 applications to have a small operations team running it all. Essentially you have software running these applications instead of humans doing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced IT professionals, the emerging Kubernetes frenzy may evoke a sense of deja vu. &quot;We're doing a redo of everything that happened in VMs,&quot; said Philips. &quot;So it's things like monitoring and management, identity and integration with identity services, security, and lifecycle management.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polvi said the plan for CoreOS is to offer a path toward more automated IT operations on Kubernetes. The upstart already provides the means to automate open source Prometheus monitoring software for container clusters, and it will soon be doing so with other open-source projects like Vault, which does secrets management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoreOS is laying the foundation for any business to do this, with its own software, the chief exec added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Automated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Overall, our whole thesis as a company been bringing automated operations forward,&quot; said Polvi. &quot;We think that automated operations, which is really about simplifying operations, is the key to security, to making the cloud-side of the web more robust.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional cloud service provider, said Polvi, provides hosting and operations. CoreOS, he added, wants to just provide the operations, because the hosting is a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/12/06/docker_logo.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;Docker logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Blue bit-box hawker submits to rival code flocker shocker&quot;&gt;Kubernetes has won. Docker Enterprise Edition will support rival container-wrangling tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/17/docker_ee_kubernetes_support/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, he's focused on selling software that runs other software. What software might need such automation? Enterprise applications for scaling, failure recovery, secrets management, provisioning, deprovisioning, installation, and monitoring ‚Äì the sort of code that fills out the container orchestration layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the value of the software we're selling you is the automated operations instead of the functionality of the code itself, like the traditional proprietary IP side of things, it means we're aligned with open source,&quot; Polvi said. &quot;It means we can take upstream Prometheus and we want that to be as big and popular as possible, so that drives more demand for our code that runs your code.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polvi said the closest equivalent to this model is the Rackspace Managed Cloud, where that provider would go into a customer's data center to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's like that except it's built in pure software,&quot; he explained. &quot;The closest equivalent is like the autopilot in a self-driving car. Traditional IT operations is: you buy the car and you hire a driver. That's your ops person. Then there's cloud, where you hire their car and their driver. It's like a chauffeur service. You just sit in the back and don't have to do anything. We're actually proposing a self-driving model, where you buy the car and you push a button and it drives itself around.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannibalized by containers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may sound a bit like automation offered by the likes of configuration management toolmakers Puppet and Chef, but Polvi and Philips see those tools operating at a lower level: deploying apps. And containerization, they contend, is replacing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the past, people hooked up Puppet or Chef to the CI/CD pipelines of their app and now they're hooking up the Kubernetes APIs for the CI/CD pipelines to deploy a new version or for testing,&quot; said Philips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polvi described Puppet and Chef as languages to tell a computer how to run infrastructure. They have advantages for some operations teams and there's no reason people can't keep using them, he said. &quot;But I think those companies need to keep a close eye on this [container-focused] world because a lot of the functionality is being replaced,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a better state of affair that the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) market. &quot;I think PaaS is dead,&quot; said Polvi. &quot;That's why you see OpenShift and Cloud Foundry and everyone pivoting to Kubernetes. What's going to happen is PaaS will be reborn as serverless on the other side of the Kubernetes transition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polvi subsequently walked back the death declaration, and suggested PaaS is evolving. He sees Kubernetes and container vendors building services atop the Kubernetes layer, and PaaS adopting serverless architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Serverless is going on its own right now but the enterprise application of serverless will happen in the post-Kubernetes deployment phase of things,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with PaaS, as Polvi put it, is that it's too restrictive and not broad enough. &quot;It was never the entire way the company did business,&quot; he said. &quot;Kubernetes fixes that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean Polvi is a fan. &quot;Lambda and serverless is one of the worst forms of proprietary lock-in that we've ever seen in the history of humanity,&quot; said Polvi, only partly in jest, referring to the most widely used serverless offering, AWS Lambda. &quot;It's seriously as bad as it gets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He elaborated: &quot;It's code that tied not just to hardware ‚Äì which we've seen before ‚Äì but to a data center, you can't even get the hardware yourself. And that hardware is now custom fabbed for the cloud providers with dark fiber that runs all around the world, just for them. So literally the application you write will never get the performance or responsiveness or the ability to be ported somewhere else without having the deployment footprint of Amazon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, Polvi says, is why the open-source community has to provide alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've heard from our customers, if you cross $100,000 a month on AWS, they'll negotiate your bill down,&quot; said Polvi. &quot;If you cross a million a month, they'll no longer negotiate with you because they know you're so locked that you're not going anywhere. That's the level where we're trying to provide some relief.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a grin, Polvi said: &quot;We haven't really used this in our messaging but we could make the argument 'put us down and your ROI is your ability to negotiate down your Amazon bill later.'&quot; ¬Æ&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trust-Busting as the Unsexy Answer to Google and Facebook</title>
<link>https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;JANUARY 28, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE ARE TWO TYPES of books in the Silicon Valley canon: books on programming and blockbuster memoirs by entrepreneurs. When I moved to San Francisco after graduating college, I had read just enough of the first kind to land a software job. After receiving my company-issued hoodie and learning the hard way when not to wear it (at parties), I decided it was time to catch up on the second kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the West Coast techie strain of elitism is far more flagrant than the East Coast strain I was used to. For instance, in his memoir, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone announces that he has come up with a new ‚Äúsocial good‚Äù‚Äìoriented definition of capitalism (fact check: he is actually just repackaging Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs 1889 ‚ÄúThe Gospel of Wealth,‚Äù a treatise justifying the concentration of wealth as a means of promoting public welfare). Among his catalog of good deeds: switching his company from bottled to filtered tap water (bottles of Starbucks‚Äôs Ethos Water available for visitors) and reserving the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RED&quot;&gt;@red&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Twitter handle for Bono‚Äôs humanitarian brand. Truly, he is virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it‚Äôs not just the feigned benevolence nor the arrogance that struck me in these memoirs but how these self-made millionaires talk about consuming, rather than overcoming, competition. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen celebrates software companies‚Äô ‚Äúeating the world,‚Äù ingesting entrenched industries in their path. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, declares that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536&quot;&gt;‚Äúcompetition is for losers,‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and claims that companies can only reach their highest creative potential if they don‚Äôt waste energy fending off pesky competition. Capitalism, according to all these men, is about frictionless, seamless engorgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their argument that monopolies can be good for the economy and good for consumers is not new ‚Äî it does not originate in Silicon Valley, as their memoirs would have us believe. It emerged in the late 19th century during the United States‚Äôs Gilded Age, advanced by men of unprecedented wealth, like J. P. Morgan, the steel, shipping, rail, banking, and electricity magnate; Andrew Carnegie, the union crusher unafraid of violence; and John D. Rockefeller, the oil man who at his death was worth roughly three times Jeff Bezos in today‚Äôs dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is different, then, is what might be called the stylistics. For one thing, the image of those old top hat‚Äìclad robber barons with their cultivated urbaneness is sartorially different from that of today‚Äôs hoodie-clad tech titans. And for another, their business tactics are different. The major tech companies don‚Äôt extort the public and shake down competitors like the monopolies of old. They give us what we want, or think we want, offering most of their services for free (email, messaging, maps, cloud storage, et cetera). On the whole, consolidation in tech seems actually to help consumers. Or does it?&lt;em&gt;¬†&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Wu‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age&lt;/em&gt;, a history of antitrust in the United States, makes a compelling case that it doesn‚Äôt. More generally, he argues that we are, in fact, in an all-out return of the Gilded Age ‚Äî and perhaps only the clothing has changed. A professor at Columbia Law School known for coining the term ‚Äúnet neutrality,‚Äù Wu argues that the very bigness of present-day companies ‚Äî especially those in the tech sector ‚Äî does not just harm consumers, but that it also threatens innovation and undermines the power of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: His prescription to end the new Gilded Age is the same bitter pill that ended the old one ‚Äî trust-busting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth revisiting the history of trust-busting, which he does in some detail in his book. During the first Gilded Age, powerful trusts were celebrated as an embodiment of social Darwinism ‚Äî in other words, as survival of the fittest. As Rockefeller himself said, ‚ÄúThe American Beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow up around it.‚Äù Between 1895 and 1904, the number of manufacturing companies operating in the United States declined from 2,274 to a mere 157. Those who survived, including General Electric, US Steel, Standard Oil, and AT&amp;amp;T, used predatory-pricing exclusionary cartels and virulent lobbyists to keep rivals at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few businesses were safe from the trusts, especially from the United States‚Äôs most aggressive bud clipper, Rockefeller himself. In 1904, investigative journalist Ida Tarbell said that, for him, ‚Äúnothing was too small: the corner grocery store in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipe line. Nothing, for little things grow.‚Äù Tarbell‚Äôs 19-part expos√© on Rockefeller‚Äôs Standard Oil would mark a turning point in setting public sentiment against the trusts. And it set the stage for one of the earliest antitrust cases, led by President Theodore Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he venerated size and power, Roosevelt forcefully brought his big stick down on the likes of Rockefeller because he understood that the Gilded Age trusts posed existential threats to the power of government. Fewer firms meant more powerful firms that could easily coordinate on prices and unify their lobbying efforts to change laws in their favor. He cleverly gave teeth to the vaguely worded Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which he then strategically deployed to win landmark cases. In the process, he became known as the trust-buster par excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, trust-busting became a bipartisan issue undergirding American nationalism. This was in part because people blamed German monopolists for enabling Hitler‚Äôs rise to power. Support for antitrust continued to grow until it reached fever pitch in the 1960s. The Johnson administration was so aggressively litigious that it prevented the merger of two Los Angeles‚Äìbased grocery chains, Von‚Äôs Grocery and Shopping Bag Food, which together would have controlled a mere 7.5 percent of market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was in this very same period, 600 miles west of Washington, that the ideological wheels favoring the return of bigness were already in motion, according to Wu. Known as the Chicago School, a group of libertarian, classical economists at the University of Chicago, including the conservative intellectual heavyweight Robert Bork, were arguing that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act was to promote ‚Äúconsumer welfare.‚Äù Monopolies, they said, should only be broken up if they raised prices for consumers, and not simply because they were too big or anti-competitive. When a young Bork first presented his thesis on the consumer welfare standard in 1964, he was considered to be on the ‚Äúlunatic fringe,‚Äù but within 20 years his thesis would shape the majority opinion of the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Wu and others have rightly pointed out, the straightforward Chicago School standard overlooks, among other things, the stifling effect monopolies can have on innovation. As a case in point: when AT&amp;amp;T was broken up in 1984, a torrent of new products came on the market, everything from the first answering machines to early ISPs. Until then, ‚ÄúMa Bell‚Äù had prevented other businesses from selling attachments to its phone jacks. Antitrust again shaped the internet in 1998 with the defunct case against Microsoft. Microsoft could easily have crushed early internet companies like Google and Amazon in their infancies if not for regulatory scrutiny, which effectively stopped it from forcing users onto Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, despite what Thiel says about the creative potential of unbridled monopolies, it feels like we are again in one of those innovation bottlenecks. In the decade between 1998 and 2008, the tech sector went from stuffing mailboxes with AOL free-trial CDs to releasing the iPhone 3G, Google Docs, Amazon Prime, and the Facebook News Feed. Another 10 years on, our technology actually looks much the same, and the promises of virtual reality, IoT, chatbots, and blockchain continue to elude us. And yet the value (and influence) of the big tech companies has only grown, now making up &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2018&quot;&gt;five of the top six&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; most valuable companies in the world by market cap. In 2008, none were in the top six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter the third presidential administration in a row without a major antitrust case, and with none on the horizon, tech companies are consolidating with impunity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; The software that is ‚Äúeating the world‚Äù is eating itself too ‚Äî Facebook has made 67 straight unchallenged acquisitions, including competitors Instagram and WhatsApp; Amazon has made 91 acquisitions, including Whole Foods; and Google has made 214, including Waze and YouTube. Budding companies that resist being acquired are pruned through &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/silicon-copy/&quot;&gt;flagrant copying.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Snapchat experienced this firsthand when its stock price and user base crumbled as soon as its signature ‚Äústory‚Äù feature appeared almost simultaneously on Facebook Inc.‚Äôs four largest platforms, Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Gilded Age even holds the risk of something unprecedented in the United States: an undemocratic alliance between big tech companies and the government. In &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJMAx91hANE&quot;&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, Wu said that, referring to while he was an advisor to the FCC,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is always trying to be helpful because they want to be our friends, in government ‚Ä¶ so they came over and they say something like ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWe know what everybody‚Äôs faces in the world look like, so if you‚Äôre looking for someone, let us know.‚Äù Now they said this in the context of missing children ‚Ä¶ [but] you can see that, pretty quickly, if you have a company which has spying powers that actually frankly transcend those of the CIA or the FBI ‚Ä¶ you have the possibility of totalitarianism that we‚Äôve never really fully witnessed ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Bigness&lt;/em&gt; leaves room for optimism in two ways. First, Wu offers a number of specific recommendations (some of them perhaps too specific to be readily understood by a general audience) on how to strengthen antitrust law, including reviewing more mergers, increasing opportunities for public comment, having the government once again take on big cases, and generally moving away from the ‚Äúconsumer welfare‚Äù definition of antitrust toward one of protecting competition. Second, he argues that the economies of scale that incentivize bigness are only beneficial up to the point when they become ‚Äúdiseconomies of scale.‚Äù In other words, layers of management and internal control systems eventually make larger companies less efficient. So long as they cannot change the rules of the game, they become less competitive as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book, &lt;em&gt;The Internet Trap: How the Digital Economy Builds Monopolies and Undermines Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, casts doubt, however, even on these two glimmers of optimism. Its author, Matthew Hindman, a media studies professor at George Washington University, argues that the rules governing tech are different ‚Äî bigness inherently translates into the kind of dominance that prunes the sector down to a few winners and a whole lot of losers. He adamantly disputes the claims of yesteryear that the internet is a Wild West meritocracy, where any programmer with grit, gumption, and a good idea could succeed. The internet does not create a level playing field ‚Äî and nowadays only PR professionals still believe that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2009/05/googles-approach-to-competition.html&quot;&gt;‚Äúcompetition is just one click away.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet Trap&lt;/em&gt; does a good job pulling back the curtain on how big tech companies make themselves ever bigger: by making major infrastructure investments to give themselves small but compounding advantages. Google learned the hard way that speed can be one such key advantage (or disadvantage) when, in 2000, the search engine experimented with showing 20, 25, and 30 results at a time instead of 10. The change added only half a second to the page‚Äôs load time, but that slight delay led to a 20 percent drop in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Google‚Äôs lodestar has been the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/the-google-gospel-of-speed-urs-hoelzle/&quot;&gt;‚Äúgospel of speed.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; That gospel has reshaped the geography of the internet, creating barriers to entry for competitors along the way. Google has laid undersea fiber-optic cables, built data centers inside of local ISPs, and spent a good chunk of its &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity&quot;&gt;$13.9 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; annual research and development budget, all in the name of a few milliseconds. As Hindman puts it, ‚ÄúMost sites cannot build a new web browser, and then make it the most popular in the world, in order to speed up their site.‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindman‚Äôs underlying claim is that if one website has a wide array of content that frequently updates itself and is also tailored to users‚Äô interests, then that website will dominate their attention. But, again, the advantage of bigness holds: the expenditure behind a feature like personalization is only feasible for the largest companies. Recommendation systems, the engines of personalization and the secret sauces behind Google‚Äôs search algorithm and Facebook‚Äôs News Feed, constitute a massive fixed cost for tech businesses but can bring about exponential growth. Hindman chronicles just how expensive they can be in his account of the Netflix Prize, a one-million-dollar reward offered by the then-DVD-rental service to the researchers who could improve the accuracy of their rating prediction algorithm by one-10th of a star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hindman points out, the prize allows for a rare public glimpse into the challenges of building recommendation systems. With the contest spanning 2,000 active teams from 152 countries working over three years, many teams had to join forces after the first year to remain competitive and eke out small improvements. Eventually two supergroups emerged ‚Äî BellKor‚Äôs Pragmatic Chaos and a 23-team Hydra called ‚ÄúThe Ensemble.‚Äù In the end, BellKor‚Äôs winning solution took more than 2,000 hours of work and included 107 algorithms. By the time the competition was over, Netflix had already pivoted to streaming and the algorithm &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429&quot;&gt;was never used in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindman covers other topics, but the book loses cohesion after the first half when it becomes mired in the statistics and academic jargon of Hindman‚Äôs own research. His economic models of the web, of internet traffic, and of local news consumption feel like tangents about methodology and fail to paint a clear picture of internet centralization. By the end of the book, Hindman shifts to advising small local newspapers on how to escape the maw of tech behemoths, and his advice ‚Äî faster load times, better design, more frequent site updates, increased focus on headlines ‚Äî feels like too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the specter of the Chicago School, the advantages of entrenched tech companies, and the monopolistic evangelism touted by Stone, Andreessen, and Thiel, the pendulum may be finally swinging against bigness. Besides Wu and Hindman, a group of ‚ÄúNeo-Brandeisian‚Äù legal scholars have started to question the legality of the tech hegemons under the Sherman Act. Most prominent among them is Lina Khan, a 29-year-old legal wunderkind whose antitrust paper on Amazon in &lt;em&gt;The Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt; sent reverberations across legal and political spheres. In example after example, her paper highlights how the consumer welfare view of antitrust fails to curb the predatory pricing and vertical integration strategies Amazon uses in its relentless pursuit of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, looking across the political landscape, it is unclear who the David is to take on the tech Goliaths. Republicans are cozy with big business, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn4&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Democrats are cozy with &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/04/22/googles-remarkably-close-relationship-with-the-obama-white-house-in-two-charts/&quot;&gt;interests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and constituents may not rally behind the issue on their own if the flow of information is controlled by the companies under threat. Still, the ideas are out there, and thanks to recent media coverage, they have penetrated the popular imagination. Perhaps this generation of Silicon Valley migrants will not read the memoirs of self-important entrepreneurs that I slogged through as a young programmer, but rather the work of anti-establishment academics like Wu, Hindman, and Khan. And then, the phrase ‚Äútrust-buster‚Äù may well return to American lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬§&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon could set predatory prices because they could recoup their losses over the long-term by locking users to the Kindle platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref2&quot; name=&quot;_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; All of this infrastructure also means that big tech companies can move more quickly to address competitors. For example, in November when Facebook released Lasso, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/lasso-facebook-app-store/&quot;&gt;its clone of the popular short-form music video app TikTok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, the company already had uploading, video serving, and recommendation technologies it could use from its other apps.&lt;/p&gt;

Netflix used a blend of these two methods until at least 2012. The competition was enough of a success that Netflix attempted to run it again, but they were stopped in 2010 by an FTC lawsuit over privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref4&quot; name=&quot;_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Republicans were not always anti-antitrust. It was Richard Nixon who in 1974 started the case that would eventually break up AT&amp;amp;T, then the largest company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Humility Training Exercise for Technical Interviewers</title>
<link>https://triplebyte.com/blog/a-humility-training-exercise-for-technical-interviewers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://triplebyte.com/blog/a-humility-training-exercise-for-technical-interviewers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr Humility is an important quality in technical interviewers. Our data shows that interviewers who are strongly confident in their own abilities give less consistent interview scores. Interviewers who are aware of their own weaknesses (and of how noisy interviews can be) in contrast, give more consistent scores. We've developed an exercise to help train interviewers in this area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming interviews are noisy.&lt;/strong&gt; Two interviewers judging the same candidate will often reach decidedly different conclusions about the candidate's skill, even in the same specific area. This noise is a significant obstacle to interview accuracy. Reducing this noise is one of the primary goals when training technical interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We train a lot of interviewers at Triplebyte. We employ a team of 40 experienced engineers to conduct interviews with candidates as they go through our platform. When we train new members of this team, we focus on several things. We make sure that interviewers are strong and up-to-date in the areas they will be measuring (it's surprisingly hard, sometimes, to distinguish a candidate who gives an unusual answer because they are an expert in an area from someone who gives an unusual answer because they don't know what they are talking about). We make sure that interviewers have clear guidelines for what skills they are assessing (this is the best defense against pattern matching bias in interviewers). &lt;strong&gt;However, I now think it's equally important to train interviewers in humility &lt;sup id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/a-humility-training-exercise-for-technical-interviewers#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of recognition of your own weaknesses is a major source of interview noise.&lt;/strong&gt; This is true because overconfident interviewers judge candidates too harshly. The field of software engineering is broad enough that no single engineer can master it all. However, we all convince ourselves that the areas that we have mastered are the most important. And we don't fully respect another engineer if they are weak in an area where we are strong (even if they are very strong in other areas). In interviews, this manifests as a bias against candidates whose technical strengths are dissimilar to those of their interviewers. We measure this at Triplebyte by having multiple interviewers observe and grade the same interview. The effect persists even when interviewers grade areas unrelated to their own strength, and even when they use structured grading rubrics. &lt;strong&gt;Interviewers just give lower scores to candidates who are not like them.&lt;/strong&gt; This is noise. It makes interviews less accurate, and we need to reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The solution, we've found, is to train interviewers in humility. Interviewers who are aware of their own weaknesses (and aware of how noisy interviews can be) are less influenced by areas other than the ones they are supposed to be evaluating, and give more consistent scores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how can you train interviewers to be humble?&lt;/strong&gt; How can you make yourself more humble? The answer, I think, is to experience what a candidate goes through. Interviewing for a job is humbling. You get grilled. You have to remember things you've not thought about in years. Smart people point out embarrassing flaws in your logic and code. You never know quite as much as you thought you did. And almost everyone fails a good percentage of their interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've developed an exercise that we use to let our interviewers experience being a candidate.&lt;/strong&gt; At first we tried simply asking interviewers to interview each other. This did not work, however, because they were not able to give honest feedback. If you interviewed your co-worker and ended up thinking that they were kind of bad, would you tell them this honestly? Most people in this situation wouldn't. We needed to get around this somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution came unexpectedly. The exercise actually started while I was trying to hire for our interview team. Part of the evaluation process that I used was asking candidates to interview me (it got really meta), and, in order to make these interviews more interesting, I gave a mix of (my attempt at) good and bad answers. I immediately noticed how this got them to give honest (and humbling) feedback--even on my ‚Äúgood‚Äù answers. &lt;strong&gt;From this experience, we developed the following exercise to train all our interviewers in humility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair up with a co-worker, and have them ask you some of their favorite interview questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell them in advance that you are going to intentionally answer some of the questions poorly (role-playing answers that a weak candidate might give).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, as the interview progresses, do exactly this. About half the time give your best answer. The other half of the time give an intentionally poor answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the interview is over, ask your co-worker to critique your answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this does is free your co-worker to be 100% honest.&lt;/strong&gt; They don't know which parts of the interview were really you trying to perform well. Moreover, they are on the hook to notice the bad answers you gave. If you gave an intentionally poor answer and they don't ‚Äúcatch‚Äù it, they look a little bad. So, they will give an honest, detailed account of their perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be careful with this exercise!&lt;/strong&gt; I've done this a bunch, and it's deeply humbling. It almost always results in someone you respect pointing out things you're bad at. And it has some potential to create conflict. I think it should probably only be done inside teams with a good degree of internal trust (the danger is convincing team members that other team members are not very good). But the result is powerful. It highlights clearly both the extent to which strong engineers are weak in certain areas, and the extent to which interviewers jump to conclusions about what a candidate means. I think everyone who conducts interviewers should put themselves through this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's important for technical interviewers to be humble.&lt;/strong&gt; This creates a better experience for the candidate, and it also makes interviews more accurate. The best interviewers are aware of their own limitations, and have a healthy appreciation of how capricious the process can be. To get better at these things, interviewers need to spend more time as candidates, being interviewed themselves. It's hard to create this experience among co-workers, but we've come up with a (dangerous!) exercise that does a pretty good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love it if people tried this exercise more broadly. I think it might be something that should become standard for interview teams at most companies. If you give it a try, email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ammon@triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;ammon@triplebyte.com&lt;/a&gt; and let me know how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've interviewed over 1000 people since starting Triplebyte. Some of the them probably don't feel that I was humble when I spoke with them. All I can say to this is... I'm sorry if I did a bad job interviewing you. Everything I write about here I apply to myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/a-humility-training-exercise-for-technical-interviewers#ref1&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.&quot;&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>If Software Is Funded from a Public Source, Its Code Should Be Open Source</title>
<link>https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-software-funded-public-source-its-code-should-be-open-source</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-software-funded-public-source-its-code-should-be-open-source</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we pay for it, we should be able to use it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because many free software coders have been outsiders and rebels, less attention is paid to the use of open source in government departments than in other contexts. But it's an important battleground, not least because there are special dynamics at play and lots of good reasons to require open-source software. It's unfortunate that the most famous attempt to convert a government IT system from proprietary code to open source‚Äîthe city of Munich‚Äîproved such a difficult experience. Although last year saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10&quot;&gt;a decision to move back to Windows&lt;/a&gt;, that seems to be more a failure of IT management, than of the code itself. Moreover, it's worth remembering that the Munich project began back in 2003, when it was a trailblazer. Today, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-to-windows-10-why-did-munich-switch-and-why-does-it-matter&quot;&gt;dozens of large-scale migrations&lt;/a&gt;, as TechRepublic reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable is perhaps the French Gendarmerie, the country's police force, which has switched 70,000 PCs to Gendbuntu, a custom version of the Linux-based OS Ubuntu. In the same country 15 French ministries have made the switch to using LibreOffice, as has the Dutch Ministry of Defence, while the Italian Ministry of Defence will switch more than 100,000 desktops from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice by 2020 and 25,000 PCs at hospitals in Copenhagen will move from Office to LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More are coming through all the time. The Municipality of Tirana, the biggest in Albania, has just announced it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2018/11/22/municipality-of-tirana&quot;&gt;moving thousands of desktops to LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/growing-100-2020&quot;&gt;80% of the city of Barcelona's IT investment this year&lt;/a&gt; will be in open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor driving this uptake by innovative government departments is the potential to cut costs by avoiding constant upgrade fees. But it's important not to overstate the &quot;free as in beer&quot; element here. All major software projects have associated costs of implementation and support. Departments choosing free software simply because they believe it will save lots of money in obvious ways are likely to be disappointed, and that will be bad for open source's reputation and future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably as important as any cost savings is the use of open standards. This ensures that there is no lock-in to a proprietary solution, and it makes the long-term access and preservation of files much easier. For governments with a broader responsibility to society than simply saving money, that should be a key consideration, even if it hasn't been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source advocates have rightly noted that free software is a natural fit for any organization that requires solutions based on open standards, interoperability and re-usable components‚Äîkey elements of the European Commission's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/strategy/decision-making_process/documents/ec_digitalstrategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;digital strategy&lt;/a&gt;, for example. One of the leaders here is the UK government. In 2014, it announced a new policy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/22/making-things-open-making-things-better&quot;&gt;&quot;Making things open, making things better&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It achieved this by setting &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2.html&quot;&gt;Open Document Format for Office Applications Version 1.2&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/sharing-or-collaborating-with-government-documents&quot;&gt;default format&lt;/a&gt; for sharing or collaborating with UK government documents. It's produced an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2018/04/27/open-document-format-in-government-an-update&quot;&gt;review of how things have gone in the last four years&lt;/a&gt;, which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot have important documents published in formats which do not meet open standards. Government documents are for everyone. Whether you're using Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, Chrome OS, iOS, Android, or any other system‚Äîyou have the right to read what we have written and we will continue on our journey to make documents open and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of open standards is not the only big benefit of moving to open source. Another is transparency. Recently it emerged that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise&quot;&gt;Microsoft has been gathering personal information&lt;/a&gt; from 300,000 government users of Microsoft Office ProPlus in the Netherlands, without permission and without documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people. Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded. Similar to this practice in Windows 10, Microsoft has included separate software in the Office software that regularly sends telemetry data to its own servers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to open-source solutions does not guarantee that personal data will not leak out, but it does ensure that the problems, once found, can be fixed quickly by government IT departments‚Äîsomething that isn't the case for closed-source products. This is a powerful reason why public funds should mean open source‚Äîor as a site created by the Free Software Foundation Europe puts it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://publiccode.eu&quot;&gt;&quot;If it is public money, it should be public code as well&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site points out some compelling reasons why any government code produced with public money should be free software. They will all be familiar enough to readers of &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;. For example, publicly funded code that is released as open source can be used by different departments, and even different governments, to solve similar problems. That opens the way for feedback and collaboration, producing better code and faster innovation. And open-source code is automatically available to the people who paid for it‚Äîmembers of the public. They too might be able to offer suggestions for improvement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/fossa/#bugbounty&quot;&gt;find bugs&lt;/a&gt; or build on it to produce exciting new applications. None of these is possible if government code is kept locked up by companies that write it on behalf of taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the natural fit of open source with public computing is evident. Indeed, when you think about it, it seems ridiculous that public money would be used to produce anything but public code. The Basque Country understood that back in 2012 and brought in a law that required all &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/basque-countrys-open-source&quot;&gt;software developed for the government there should be released as open source&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the Canadian government has made the connection too. Its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249&quot;&gt;Directive on Management of Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where possible, use open standards and open source software first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that this approach is not already the norm is something of a failure on the part of the Free Software community. Perhaps it's time to drop the snobbery about open source in government and put more effort into turning it into the next huge win for the world of free software.&lt;/p&gt;
