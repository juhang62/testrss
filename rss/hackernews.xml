&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.0 is the previous stable release. It is no longer being updated, and does not work well with high resolution displays, but it currently has a larger selection of add-ons available. Your card data is compatible between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.0.52.exe&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for Windows Vista/7/8/10 (2.0.52)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.1 was released recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.1.2-windows.exe&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for Windows 7/8/10 (2.1.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the installer to your desktop or downloads folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click on the installer to run it. Anki will be installed to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click on the new Anki icon on your desktop to start Anki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you receive the error &quot;The application has failed to start because the configuration is incorrect&quot;, please install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11895&quot;&gt;this Microsoft library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading is as simple as installing the new version over the old version, and your data will be preserved. Simply close Anki if it's currently running, then follow the steps in the Installation section above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9+, Windows 8+, and Norton Antivirus users: these products may display scary warning messages when new Anki versions are released, because they have not seen people previously downloading the new version. This &quot;helpful&quot; behaviour can be worked around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.0 is the previous stable release. It is no longer being updated, and does not work well with high resolution displays, but it currently has a larger selection of add-ons available. Your card data is compatible between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not sure which 2.0.52 version to pick? Run 'uname -a' in a terminal and look for x86_64 - if you see it, you want the 64 bit build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These packages require an Intel or AMD machine - they will not work on other architectures like ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.1 was released recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.1.2-linux-amd64.tar.bz2&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for 64 bit Linux (2.1.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once downloaded, the following commands in a terminal window will install it system-wide. The $ is the prompt character, and shouldn't be typed in. Make sure what you're entering in matches the file you downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar xjf Downloads/anki-2.0.52-amd64.tar.bz2
$ cd anki-2.0.52
$ sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were running Anki from a .deb/.rpm/etc in the past, please make sure to remove the system version before installing the package provided here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're upgrading from a previous package, simply repeat the installation steps to upgrade to the latest version. Your user data will be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Linux distributions include Anki in their repositories. We've seen many users experience problems with these distributed versions, due to them being out of date or missing appropriate libraries. For this reason, the compiled package above is recommended over using the version of Anki bundled with your Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnome users&lt;/strong&gt;: to get GTK themes working, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/anki-not-picking-up-gtk-theme-on-gnomelinux&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Source code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to build Anki yourself, you will need to ensure you have the required dependencies installed, and you may not be able to run from source on the latest Linux distributions, as a number have stopped shipping a library Anki depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not able to provide any support for issues you may encounter when running from source - if in doubt please use the compiled package instead.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Data Scientists Really Do, According to Data Scientists</title>
<link>https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do data scientists do? According to interviews with more than 30 data scientists, data science is about infrastructure, testing, using machine learning for decision making, and data products. Data science is being used in numerous fields, but it’s not all about deep learning or the search for artificial general intelligence. In fact, the skills needed include communication and storytelling. But data science is becoming more specialized, and with that the skills data scientists need are evolving. In addition, ethics is becoming a bigger and bigger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;212.70399010207&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern data science emerged in tech, from optimizing Google search rankings and LinkedIn recommendations to influencing the headlines Buzzfeed editors run. But it’s poised to transform all sectors, from retail, telecommunications, and agriculture to health, trucking, and the penal system. Yet the terms “data science” and “data scientist” aren’t always easily understood, and are used to describe a wide range of data-related work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, is it that data scientists do? As the host of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast&quot;&gt;DataCamp podcast &lt;em&gt;DataFramed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I have had the pleasure of speaking with over 30 data scientists across a wide array of industries and academic disciplines. Among other things, I’ve asked them about what their jobs entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;How companies are using artificial intelligence in their business operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that data science is a varied field. The data scientists I’ve interviewed approach our conversations from many angles. They describe a wide range of work, including the massive online experimental frameworks for product development at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Booking.com&quot;&gt;booking.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and Etsy, the methods Buzzfeed uses to implement a multi-armed bandit solution for headline optimization, and the impact machine learning has on business decisions at Airbnb. That last example came during my conversation with Airbnb data scientist Robert Chang. When Chang was at Twitter, that company was focused on growth. Now that he’s at Airbnb, Chang works on productionized machine-learning models. Data science can be used in a number of different ways, depending not just on the industry but on the business and its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all the variety, a number of themes have emerged from these conversations. Here’s what they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What data scientists do. &lt;/strong&gt;We now know how data science works, at least in the tech industry. First, data scientists lay a solid data foundation in order to perform robust analytics. Then they use online experiments, among other methods, to achieve sustainable growth. Finally, they build machine learning pipelines and personalized data products to better understand their business and customers and to make better decisions. In other words, in tech, data science is about infrastructure, testing, machine learning for decision making, and data products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great strides are being made in industries other than tech. &lt;/strong&gt;I spoke with Ben Skrainka, a data scientist at Convoy, about how that company is leveraging data science to revolutionize the North American trucking industry. Sandy Griffith of Flatiron Health told us about the impact data science has begun to have on cancer research. Drew Conway and I discussed his company Alluvium, which “uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to turn massive data streams produced by industrial operations into insights.” Mike Tamir, now head of self-driving at Uber, discussed working with Takt to facilitate Fortune 500 companies’ leveraging data science, including his work on Starbucks’ recommendation systems. This non-exhaustive list illustrates data-science revolutions across a multitude of verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It isn’t all just the promise of self-driving cars and artificial general intelligence. &lt;/strong&gt;Many of my guests are skeptical not only of the fetishization of artificial general intelligence by the mainstream media (including headlines such as VentureBeat’s “An AI god will emerge by 2042 and write its own bible. Will you worship it?”), but also of the buzz around machine learning and deep learning. Sure, machine learning and deep learning are powerful techniques with important applications, but, as with all buzz terms, a healthy skepticism is in order. Nearly all of my guests understand that working data scientists make their daily bread and butter through data collection and data cleaning; building dashboards and reports; data visualization; statistical inference; communicating results to key stakeholders; and convincing decision makers of their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skills data scientists need are evolving (and experience with deep learning isn’t the most important one). &lt;/strong&gt;In a conversation with Jonathan Nolis, a data science leader in the Seattle area who helps Fortune 500 companies, we posed the question, “Which skill is more important for a data scientist: the ability to use the most sophisticated deep learning models, or the ability to make good PowerPoint slides?” He made a case for the latter, since communicating results remains a critical part of data work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recurring theme is that these skills, so necessary today, are likely to change on a relatively short timescale. As we’re seeing rapid developments in both the open-source ecosystem of tools available to do data science and in the commercial, productized data-science tools, we’re also seeing increasing automation of a lot of data-science drudgery, such as data cleaning and data preparation. It has been a common trope that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/08/ibm-data-catalog-data-scientists-productivity/&quot;&gt;80% of a data scientist’s valuable time&lt;/a&gt; is spent simply finding, cleaning, and organizing data, leaving only 20% to actually perform analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is unlikely to last. These days even a great deal of machine learning and deep learning is being automated, as we learned when we dedicated an episode to automated machine learning, and heard from Randal Olson, lead data scientist at Life Epigenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One result of this rapid change is that the vast majority of my guests tell us that the key skills for data scientists are not the abilities to build and use deep-learning infrastructures. Instead they are the abilities to learn on the fly and to communicate well in order to answer business questions, explaining complex results to nontechnical stakeholders. Aspiring data scientists, then, should focus less on techniques than on questions. New techniques come and go, but critical thinking and quantitative, domain-specific skills will remain in demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialization is becoming more important. &lt;/strong&gt;While there is no well-defined career path for data scientists, and little support for junior data scientists, we are starting to see some forms of specialization. Emily Robinson described the difference between Type A and Type B data scientists: “Type A is the analysis — sort of a traditional statistician — and Type B is building machine learning models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nolis breaks data science down into three components: (1) business intelligence, which is essentially about “taking data that the company has and getting it in front of the right people” in the form of dashboards, reports, and emails; (2) decision science, which is about “taking data and using it to help a company make a decision”; and (3) machine learning, which is about “how can we take data science models and put them continuously into production.” Although many working data scientists are currently generalists and do all three, we are seeing distinct career paths emerging, as in the case of machine learning engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics is among the field’s biggest challenges. &lt;/strong&gt;You may gather that the profession offers its practitioners a great deal of uncertainty. When I asked Hilary Mason in our first episode if any other major challenges face the data science community, she said, “Do you think that imprecise ethics, no standards of practice, and a lack of consistent vocabulary are not enough challenges for us today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three are essential points, and the first two in particular are front of mind for nearly every &lt;em&gt;DataFramed&lt;/em&gt; guest. At a time when so many of our interactions with the world are dictated by algorithms developed by data scientists, what role does ethics play? As Omoju Miller, the senior machine learning data scientist at GitHub, said in our interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have that ethical understanding, we need to have that training, and we need to have something akin to a Hippocratic oath. And we need to actually have proper licenses so that if you actually do something unethical, perhaps you have some kind of penalty, or disbarment, or some kind of recourse, something to say this is not what we want to do as an industry, and then figure out ways to remediate people who go off the rails and do things because people just aren’t trained and they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme is the serious, harmful, and unethical consequences that data science can have, such as the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Score that has been “used across the country to predict future criminals” and is “biased against blacks,” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&quot;&gt;according to ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re approaching a consensus that ethical standards need to come from within data science itself, as well as from legislators, grassroots movements, and other stakeholders. Part of this movement involves a reemphasis on interpretability in models, as opposed to black-box models. That is, we need to build models that can explain why they make the predictions they make. Deep learning models are great at a lot of things, but they are infamously uninterpretable. Many dedicated, intelligent researchers, developers, and data scientists are making headway here with work such as &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marcotcr/lime&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a project aimed at explaining what machine learning models are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data science revolution across industries and society at large has just begun. Whether the title of data scientist will remain the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century&quot;&gt;sexiest job of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;,” will become more specialized, or will become a set of skills that most working professionals are simply required to have is unclear. As Hilary Mason told me: “Will we even have data science in 10 years? I remember a world where we didn’t, and it wouldn’t surprise me if the title goes the way of ‘webmaster.’”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;(Two Navy destroyers were named McCain, for the senator’s father and grandfather, the first father-and-son full admirals in American naval history.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Whipsawed by family relocations, young John attended some 20 schools before finally settling into Episcopal High School, an all-white, all-boys boarding school in Alexandria, Va., in the fall of 1951 for his last three years of secondary education. The school, with an all-male faculty and enrollments drawn mostly from upper-crust families of the Old South, required jackets and ties for classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the scion of one of the Navy’s most illustrious families was defiant and unruly. He mocked the dress code by wearing dirty bluejeans. His shoes were held together with tape, and his coat looked like a reject from the Salvation Army. He was cocky and combative, easily provoked and ready to fight anyone. Classmates called him McNasty. Most gave him a wide berth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“He cultivated the image,” Robert Timberg wrote in a biography, “John McCain: An American Odyssey” (1995). “The Episcopal yearbook pictures him in a trench coat, collar up, cigarette dangling Bogey-style from his lips. That pose, if hardly the impression Episcopal sought to project, at least had a fashionable world-weary style to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;John and a few friends often sneaked off campus at night to patronize bars and burlesque houses in Washington. He joined the wrestling team — a 127-pound dynamo, he once pinned an opponent in 37 seconds, a school record — and the junior varsity football team, as a linebacker and offensive guard. His grades were abysmal, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/books/review/john-mccain-by-the-book.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;except in literature and history, his favorite subjects.&lt;/a&gt; He graduated in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That summer, he followed his father and grandfather into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He resisted the discipline. His grades were poor. He stood up to upperclassmen, broke rules and piled up demerits, though never enough to warrant expulsion. But he became a ferocious boxer, a magnet for attractive young women and one of the most popular midshipmen in his class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1ljmzo6 eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;In the Cockpit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. McCain possessed the rugged independence of a natural leader. It came out at parties and in carousing with friends. Caught by the Shore Patrol at an off-limits bar, he led a carload of drinking buddies in a daring escape. “Being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck,” one recalled. In 1958, he graduated 894th in his class, fifth from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle2&quot;&gt;repaying loans and the Department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle2&quot;&gt;of Education began reporting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Note: “High” default rates are 30% or greater. Source: Department of Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33.388489208633&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Millions of students will arrive on college campuses soon, and they will share a similar burden: college debt. The typical student borrower will take out $6,600 in a single year, averaging $22,000 in debt by graduation, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx?ps_x=cchbkaa2&quot;&gt;National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;There are two ways to measure whether borrowers can repay those loans: There’s what the federal government looks at to judge colleges, and then there’s the real story. The latter is coming to light, and it’s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37.77520661157&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/schooltyperates.pdf&quot;&gt;official statistics&lt;/a&gt;: Of borrowers who started repaying in 2012, just over 10 percent had defaulted three years later. That’s not too bad — but it’s not the whole story. Federal data never before released shows that the default rate continued climbing to 16 percent over the next two years, after official tracking ended, meaning more than 841,000 borrowers were in default. Nearly as many were severely delinquent or not repaying their loans (for reasons besides going back to school or being in the military). The share of students facing serious struggles rose to 30 percent over all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-graphic&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle0&quot;&gt;Tracking period ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle2&quot;&gt;period ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;Students begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;repaying loans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Collectively, these borrowers owed over $23 billion, including more than $9 billion in default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Nationally, those are crisis-level results, and they reveal how colleges are benefiting from billions in financial aid while students are left with debt they cannot repay. The Department of Education recently provided this new data on over 5,000 schools across the country in response to my Freedom of Information Act request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The new data makes clear that the federal government overlooks early warning signs by focusing solely on default rates over the first three years of repayment. That’s the time period Congress requires the Department of Education to use when calculating default rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;At that time, about one-quarter of the cohort — or nearly 1.3 million borrowers — were not in default, but were either severely delinquent or not paying their loans. Two years later, many of these borrowers were either still not paying or had defaulted. Nearly 280,000 borrowers defaulted between years three and five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Federal laws attempting to keep schools accountable are not doing enough to stop loan problems. The law requires that all colleges participating in the student loan program keep their share of borrowers who default below 30 percent for three consecutive years or 40 percent in any single year. We can consider anything above 30 percent to be a “high” default rate. That’s a low bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Among the group who started repaying in 2012, just 93 of their colleges had high default rates after three years and 15 were at immediate risk of losing access to aid. Two years later, after the Department of Education stopped tracking results, 636 schools had high default rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;For-profit institutions have particularly awful results. Five years into repayment, 44 percent of borrowers at these schools faced some type of loan distress, including 25 percent who defaulted. Most students who defaulted between three and five years in repayment attended a for-profit college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32.61154855643&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The secret to avoiding accountability? Colleges are aggressively pushing borrowers to use repayment options known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance&quot;&gt;deferments or forbearances&lt;/a&gt; that allow borrowers to stop their payments without going into delinquency or defaulting.

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The federal government cannot keep turning a blind eye while almost one-third of student loan borrowers struggle. Fortunately, efforts to rewrite federal higher-education laws present an opportunity to address these shortcomings. This should include losing federal aid if borrowers are not repaying their loans — even if they do not default. Loan performance should also be tracked for at least five years instead of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35.953535353535&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The federal government, states and institutions also need to make significant investments in college affordability to reduce the number of students who need a loan in the first place. Too many borrowers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2017/12/14/444011/student-loan-defaulters/&quot;&gt;and defaulters&lt;/a&gt; are low-income students, the very people who would receive only grant aid under a rational system for college financing. Forcing these students to borrow has turned one of America’s best investments in socioeconomic mobility — college — into a debt trap for far too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Elm 0.19 Broke Us</title>
<link>https://dev.to/kspeakman/elm-019-broke-us--khn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dev.to/kspeakman/elm-019-broke-us--khn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Elm 0.19 was released yesterday. There were a significant number of breaking changes at every level: configuration, tooling, library, language. But those are not what this post is primarily about. For my team, this release broke our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two changes that placed the proverbial &quot;straw that broke the camel's back&quot;: Removal of custom operators and native modules. At first I only saw the removal of custom operators, and I posted my reaction to that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/evancz/769bba8abb9ddc3bf81d69fa80cc76b1#gistcomment-2685482&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The removal of native modules was not mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.19.md&quot;&gt;0.19 release notes&lt;/a&gt; so I didn't find out about it until today. I just happened to think of it, and a search turned up &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/native-code-in-0-19/826&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The post on native modules was back in March, so how did I not know about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disconnected from participating in the Elm community a little while back. I didn't say much about it at the time, but I'll share the reasons. I love the Elm platform and use it, but decided that the way the community is managed is too frustrating. The tone is firmly set by the way the Elm Github issues are managed. Many of them are locked to prevent disagreeable feedback, or because they are personal items only for the blessed few contributors, even though they are in public. If you post an issue, you are likely to get smacked on the hand for not doing things &quot;properly&quot;. Properly means a rigorous SCCE for bugs, or participating in the gladiator arena of public forums for ideas/requests/suggestions, or you can forget both of those things if you went the extra, extra miles to be trusted as a contributor. I say gladiator arena, but &lt;strong&gt;the Elm community is really very nice in general&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for helping newcomers. However there are more than a few people who have their rulers out and ready to smack that hand to enforce whatever Evan (the creator of Elm) has said or not said. So chances are high that posting &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot; on the forum will result in being chided. This, in turn, justifies that there was no &quot;agreement&quot; on your post among the community so it can be ignored. So the &quot;go post on the forum first&quot; rule is an effective way to ignore feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently since Elm forums have moved to (edit: Reddit and) Discourse, threads there can be locked too. When mods know Evan doesn't want to hear your disagreement on a particular issue, they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/elm-0-19-released-what-has-changed-regarding-native-event-modules/1670&quot;&gt;preemptively lock&lt;/a&gt; posts where it might surface. In the end, it feels like the D in BDFL is taken a little too seriously over there. So I appreciated the product but mostly stayed away from the community, and didn't happen to catch the posts telegraphing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I did have a bad experience myself, and have fault in that. But I have observed this pattern of unwelcomeness in Elm's old github and google group many times as an onlooker. And it isn't this way in other projects I've worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of custom operators was ostensibly for the good of Elm. However, in the post explaining the reasoning behind their removal, an estimated 5% of users have them. And several of the reasons for using them are in common with other languages (task chaining, parsing). In the end, specific custom operators were blessed by Evan and were allowed to remain as exceptions to the rule. But whatever ordinary Elm users think is a valid custom operator for their use cases is &quot;bad&quot; for Elm. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically I can still inject native modules through monkey patching in 0.19. (Javascript, right!) However with dead code elimination, monkey patching could be a bit difficult unless you turn off optimizations. But the real kicker is that native modules are still there. They are just reserved for a few Elm contributors only. The rest of us should not have access to this expert feature. Apparently the 40 total lines of native code that I use will completely break the Elm community. Even though there is no other reasonable way to do what I need. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor but indicative: Evan has posted many times telling users to change the way they talk or think about Elm. (Fair point: he's nice about it and there are valid points. But still... indicative.) Examples: Don't use the word Components. Don't say &quot;native&quot;; say &quot;kernel&quot; instead. Union types should now be called Custom Types. But don't you dare respond to one of his posts -- there is always a closing section instructing you of the only few acceptable replies or to just not reply at all. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all of the above, a picture is forming for us: we can expect to be overbearingly micromanaged as Elm users. And feedback (well, disagreement) is not welcome or considered even when it is decisive and voluminous, like on native modules. Evan decides he just doesn't like something he sees Elm users doing (even if it has credibility from similar languages, like custom operators), it gets disabled in the next release. My way or the highway. Despite all the amazing things Elm has been to us, that's &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; behavior for a toolchain. And not really a situation my team wants to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, we have a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep using 0.18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not had any major issues with 0.18. We could avoid the broken things that have been pointed out in the changelog (like Arrays). However, this is not a long term strategy. It seems unlikely that 0.18 will ever see another bugfix. Old versions of tools (like Create Elm App) eventually stop being maintained. Meanwhile Computer Science and the web advances on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monkey patch 0.19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the dead code elimination, putting the formerly &quot;native&quot; code in through monkey patching has some unknowns. But the deeper issue is that by moving to 0.19 we are still in a place of feeling unstable with the future of our toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait for an Elm fork&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of tree names are probably still available (i.e. acacia, poplar, etc). Unfortunately we do not have the resources to maintain a fork. But it seems likely that somebody will draw similar conclusions to us and be in a place where they want to create one. Even then, this path has a lot of unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait for Elm to solidify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects reach a phase where they solidify. Meaning there is some effort to maintain backward compatibility. If Elm decides to do this at some point, we could evaluate where the latest version is. Maybe by then there legitimately won't be a need to have the freedoms which were taken away, so it will be a moot issue. However, probably as long as Encoders and Decoders are the only official way to deal with JSON, we will need native code. 20 lines of native code saves us hundreds of lines of encoders and decoders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switch to something else&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other Model-View-Update platform I'm aware of is Fable-Elmish. It uses F#, which we already use for APIs anyway. The unfortunate bit about that is that F# is not a pure language. So it takes discipline to write pure functions. Whereas Elm has been taking purity too far with some of these recent changes, F# is not quite far enough IMO for the front end. But F# is great for APIs since they are about integrating external systems (e.g. UI, database, email, files, etc). F# would be harder to use there if it had a lot of overhead to perform side effects. &lt;em&gt;Striking the right balance for the use case is important.&lt;/em&gt; Anyway, it is still an option on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could also arise an alternative MVU platform at some point. I believe ClojureScript has a library which works similar to MVU. I don't really want to go back to a component-based system. (Yes, pure function MVU is that good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has all agreed that sticking with 0.18 is the best choice for us right now. We have some apps coming up that we will create with 0.18, ignoring 0.19. We will experiment with Fable. We will see if another MVU style platform is around. Eventually 0.18 will start to rot and we will need to switch to something else going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find this situation really disheartening. We love Elm and never wanted to use anything else. But we have begun to feel that our relationship with Elm is unstable. 💔&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Money Really Does Lead to a More Satisfying Life</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/business/money-satisfaction-lottery-study.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/business/money-satisfaction-lottery-study.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;35.068500539374&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;21.307443365696&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;New research suggests that more money really does lead to a more satisfying life. Surveys of thousands of Swedish lottery winners have provided persuasive evidence of this truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Lottery winners said they were substantially more satisfied with their lives than lottery losers. And those who won prizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars reported being more satisfied than winners of mere tens of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These effects are remarkably durable. They were still evident up to two decades after a big win. (The researchers lacked the data to trace out even longer-term consequences.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The findings appear in a research report, “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ifn.se/storage/ma/610d56a6f5a94a7596d54551e333b68f/749eaac5ac3e4de7bf6374d23c2c0ed2/pdf/6B4806B539C9DE75172BADE06A7B6E3806800315/Wp1220.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Long-Run Effects of Lottery Wealth on Psychological Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;,” that has generated a lot of buzz among economists over the summer. The working paper, by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Lindqvist&lt;/a&gt; from the Stockholm School of Economics, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://perseus.iies.su.se/~rob/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Ostling&lt;/a&gt; from Stockholm University and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/dac12/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Cesarini&lt;/a&gt; from New York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;30.486759142497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is certain to feed a long-running debate about the role that personal finances play in shaping subjective well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Many previous analyses — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/NewStylizedFacts(Emotion).pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/Satiation(AER).pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; that I have conducted with my partner, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~bstevens/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betsey Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow University of Michigan economist — have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://freakonomics.com/2008/04/22/the-economics-of-happiness-part-4-are-rich-people-happier-than-poor-people/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; that people with higher incomes tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction. The relationship between income and satisfaction is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remarkably similar&lt;/a&gt; across dozens of countries, suggesting that findings about Sweden likely apply to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/business/16leonhardt.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; merely documented a correlation. What’s new here is the evidence that higher income is causing higher life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This research is able to reliably disentangle causation and correlation because a lottery effectively provides a randomized control trial. As in the trial of a new drug, those who received the treatment — in this case a big dose of money, courtesy of a lottery ticket — were compared both with those who received a smaller dose by winning a minor prize and with statistically matched individuals of the same age and sex who entered the lottery and didn’t win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a drug trial — as in a lottery — whether you get the big dose, a smaller dose or no dose is determined purely by chance. Scientists find this sort of trial to be persuasive because the random assignment ensures that lottery winnings are the only factor driving systematic differences between those who receive the treatment and those in the control group. It therefore isolates the effect of extra money in driving satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;52.013354917038&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;50.050586806961&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors persuaded the Swedish statistical authorities to try to survey every winner of three of the country’s major lotteries over more than a decade, and then used government records to track other aspects of the winners’ lives. The researchers examined the same indicators for Swedes who had entered but lost the same lotteries, or who won minor prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Their surveys took several approaches to measuring subjective well-being. The measure most robustly linked to income asks people how satisfied they are with their lives as a whole. By contrast, responses to a question asking about happiness showed less of a connection to lottery winnings, and these effects could not be reliably distinguished from the effects of chance. Social scientists widely view questions about life satisfaction as eliciting a broad-based evaluation of one’s life while questions about happiness yield responses more related to current moods or feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A further set of questions probed the mental health of respondents, finding that greater income had no effect, although in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;related work&lt;/a&gt;, the same authors find that lottery winners are prescribed fewer mental health drugs. I interpret this as suggestive but not conclusive evidence that wealth improves one’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Other studies by these authors — sometimes with other scholars — have tracked the economic lives of these lottery winners to further explore the consequences of wealth. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Contrary&lt;/a&gt; to popular stereotypes, those who win hundreds of thousands of dollars don’t blow most of their winnings at once. Instead, they slowly spend their newfound wealth over many years. Many don’t quit their jobs, but they do tend to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151589&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work a bit less&lt;/a&gt; and retire a bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, the increase in wealth caused by winning the lottery has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few effects&lt;/a&gt; on the physical health of the winners or their children. It seems possible that family wealth might have quite different effects in a less egalitarian society, like the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These results provide strong evidence in support of the standard economic view that money increases well-being, albeit not in an entirely uniform manner. It runs counter to the view championed by many psychologists that people largely adapt to their circumstances — including their financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an email, Mr. Cesarini characterized that perspective as the “widespread misperception that science has proved that winning the lottery often makes people miserable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.588830829523&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;37.255388634879&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That misperception most likely comes from an earlier generation of lottery studies. Perhaps the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22451114_Lottery_Winners_and_Accident_Victims_Is_Happiness_Relative/links/54244b8d0cf26120b7a735b4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most famous&lt;/a&gt; of them is a 1978 study, “Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?” With the benefit of hindsight, that study appears to illustrate changing standards of empirical research more than any truths about well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It compared the subjective well-being of 22 winners of the Illinois State Lottery with a control group of 22 people. The lottery winners rated themselves as happier after winning their prizes, but because the sample size was so small, the researchers concluded that this might reflect the influence of chance and failed to note that these data were consistent with the idea that the lottery winners were substantially happier. The problem with small samples is that it’s hard to be sure of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That same study also surveyed 29 paraplegic accident victims, finding them to be less happy than other people. Yet &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.ted.com/ten-years-later-dan-gilbert-on-life-after-the-surprising-science-of-happiness/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABBRKYdQa7E&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.aish.com/sp/pg/From-Millionaires-to-Paraplegics-The-Secret-of-Happiness.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; of this study describe it as if it supported the opposite proposition, that people adapt to personal tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I’ve seen this pattern before, as a counterintuitive finding captures the public’s imagination, taking on a life of its own. In time, the facts become too interesting to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But eventually, science corrects itself. After 40 years, three determined economists, thousands of lottery winners and reams of detailed data have revealed a more reliable but less romantic truth: Money really does help people lead a more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Skim reading is the new normal. The effect on society is profound</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/25/skim-reading-new-normal-maryanne-wolf</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/25/skim-reading-new-normal-maryanne-wolf</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ook around on your next plane trip. The iPad is the new pacifier for babies and toddlers. Younger school-aged children read stories on smartphones; older boys don’t read at all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other passengers read on Kindles or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds. Unbeknownst to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links everyone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain’s ability to read is subtly, rapidly changing - a change with implications for everyone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a new circuit in our species’ brain more than 6,000 years ago. That circuit evolved from a very simple mechanism for decoding basic information, like the number of goats in one’s herd, to the present, highly elaborated reading brain. My research depicts how the present reading brain enables the development of some of our most important intellectual and affective processes: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference; perspective-taking and empathy; critical analysis and the generation of insight. Research surfacing in many parts of the world now cautions that each of these essential “deep reading” processes may be under threat as we move into digital-based modes of reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;mobile&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78be9dbc908e1da2dfb0ff9323ab30bfabd76e6b/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=43c2ef0e2286b4187753d92e4823aa42&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There’s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or lose it Photograph: Sjale/Getty Images/iStockphoto
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple, binary issue of print vs digital reading and technological innovation. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle has written, we do not err as a society when we innovate, but when we ignore what we disrupt or diminish while innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital cultures, society needs to confront what is diminishing in the expert reading circuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from research that the reading circuit is not given to human beings through a genetic blueprint like vision or language; it needs an environment to develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment’s requirements – from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used. If the dominant medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task oriented and well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital medium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA psychologist Patricia Greenfield writes, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to slower, time-demanding deep reading processes, like inference, critical analysis and empathy, all of which are indispensable to learning at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;The negative effects of screen reading can appear as early as fourth and fifth grade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing reports from educators and from researchers in psychology and the humanities bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark Edmundson describes how many college students actively avoid the classic literature of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries because they no longer have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less concerned with students’ “cognitive impatience,” however, than by what may underlie it: the potential inability of large numbers of students to read with a level of critical analysis sufficient to comprehend the complexity of thought and argument found in more demanding texts, whether in literature and science in college, or in wills, contracts and the deliberately confusing public referendum questions citizens encounter in the voting booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of troubling downstream effects on reading comprehension in older high school and college students. In Stavanger, Norway, psychologist Anne Mangen and her colleagues studied how high school students comprehend the same material in different mediums. Mangen’s group asked subjects questions about a short story whose plot had universal student appeal (a lust-filled, love story); half of the students read Jenny, Mon Amour&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on a Kindle, the other half in paperback. Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail and reconstruct the plot in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of studies which indicate that the “new norm” in reading is &lt;em&gt;skimming&lt;/em&gt;, with word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use an F or Z pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the rest of the text. When the reading brain skims like this, it reduces time allocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don’t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another’s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;reading&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0598da09e3ebe592d48f794d8359c1b92b7321d4/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=6df666eae1458a5ae6faff55167ac815&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karin Littau and Andrew Piper have noted another dimension: physicality. Piper, Littau and Anne Mangen’s group emphasize that the sense of touch in print reading adds an important redundancy to information – a kind of “geometry” to words, and a spatial “thereness” for text. As Piper notes, human beings need a knowledge of where they are in time and space that allows them to return to things and learn from re-examination – what he calls the “technology of recurrence”. The importance of recurrence for both young and older readers involves the ability to go back, to check and evaluate one’s understanding of a text. The question, then, is what happens to comprehension when our youth skim on a screen whose lack of spatial thereness discourages “looking back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US media researchers Lisa Guernsey and Michael Levine, American University’s linguist Naomi Baron, and cognitive scientist Tami Katzir from Haifa University have examined the effects of different information mediums, particularly on the young. Katzir’s research has found that the negative effects of screen reading can appear as early as fourth and fifth grade - with implications not only for comprehension, but also on the growth of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;We need to cultivate a new kind of brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility that critical analysis, empathy and other deep reading processes could become the unintended “collateral damage” of our digital culture is not a simple binary issue about print vs digital reading. It is about how we all have begun to read on any medium and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for why we read. Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all. It affects our ability to navigate a constant bombardment of information. It incentivizes a retreat to the most familiar silos of unchecked information, which require and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false information and demagoguery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or lose it. It is a very hopeful principle when applied to critical thought in the reading brain because it implies&lt;em&gt; choice&lt;/em&gt;. The story of the changing reading brain is hardly finished. We possess both the science and the technology to identify and redress the changes in how we read before they become entrenched. If we work to understand exactly what we will lose, alongside the extraordinary new capacities that the digital world has brought us, there is as much reason for excitement as caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to cultivate a new kind of brain: a “bi-literate” reading brain capable of the deepest forms of thought in either digital or traditional mediums&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A great deal hangs on it: the ability of citizens in a vibrant democracy to try on other perspectives and discern truth; the capacity of our children and grandchildren to appreciate and create beauty; and the ability in ourselves to go &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; our present glut of information to reach the knowledge and wisdom necessary to sustain a good society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

<title>Japan to add millions of new nodes to federated Nextcloud network</title>
<link>https://nextcloud.com/blog/japan-to-add-millions-of-new-nodes-to-federated-nextcloud-network/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nextcloud.com/blog/japan-to-add-millions-of-new-nodes-to-federated-nextcloud-network/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Nextcloud, Waffle Computer and NEC Platforms to bring federated file exchange and collaboration to millions of new users in Japan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that through a partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.necplatforms.co.jp/en/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NEC Platforms, Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; and Waffle Computer, Ltd., millions of routers will be equipped with Nextcloud, bringing secure, federated and private file exchange to their users. The global network of hundreds of thousands of Nextcloud servers, capable of seamlessly exchanging data with each other, will thus be extended by millions of new nodes over the course of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nextcloud Federation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Nextcloud, everyone from home users to large enterprises, hospitals and government agencies can host their own, secure and private Dropbox or Office 365 alternative. Nextcloud offers easy to use web, desktop and mobile interfaces to sync files, share them with others and edit them on-the-go. By keeping data on a trusted server, users know where data is, who has access, and nothing leaks. As most most popular self-hosted file sync and collaboration technology with hundreds of thousands of servers on the web, Nextcloud is used by companies like SIEMENS, institutes like the German Federal government, research organizations like the Max-Planck-institute, financial enterprises like Raiffeisen and many more. Its combined number of users is estimated to be over 25 million globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud servers are not alone. The Nextcloud Federation feature enables users from one Nextcloud server to share with users on another server, creating a globally spanning network of private, self-hosted clouds. A federated cloud id, comparable to an email address, enables users to identify one another, while servers also exchange address book data when authorized to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan joining the Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the deployment of Nextcloud on the upcoming generation of routers from NEC Platforms, Ltd., the global network of federated Nextclouds will be expanding with millions of nodes, starting in Japan. This marks a significant step for Nextcloud and its users, bringing even greater momentum to the meteoric growth of Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEC Platforms, Ltd. (https://www.necplatforms.co.jp/en/company/profile.html), is a subsidiary of NEC Corporation, and is also a leader in Japan broadband access market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waffle Computer, Ltd. is a Nextcloud partner in Japan, dedicated to bringing federated, decentralized computing to users across the globe and connecting major technology partners to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working with Nextcloud on expanding the file storage and exchange capabilities of our router solutions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;said Mr. Shinji Nakayama, Chief Manager at the Access-Device Development Division at NEC Platforms,Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to federate between routers and form a global network enables our users to collaborate with others while staying in control over their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe routers are a great platform to bring self-hosted clouds into the house of millions of users,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;said Frank Karlitschek, founder and managing director of Nextcloud GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be as easy and normal to have your own data at home as it is to own a television or mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration with Nextcloud and NEC Platforms is very exciting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;said Masayuki Note, founder and owner of Waffle Computer, Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite studies ever is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w22487.pdf&quot;&gt;‘Heads or Tails: The Impact of a Coin Toss on Major Life Decisions and Subsequent Happiness’&lt;/a&gt; by economist Steven Levitt of ‘Freakonomics’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt collected tens of thousands of people who were deeply unsure whether to make a big change in their life. After offering some advice on how to make hard choices, those who remained truly undecided were given the chance to use a flip of a coin to settle the issue. 22,500 did so. Levitt then followed up two and six months later to ask people whether they had actually made the change, and how happy they were out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who faced an important decision and got heads – which indicated they should quit, break up, propose, or otherwise mix things up – were 11 percentage points more likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very rare to get a convincing experiment that can help us answer as general and practical a question as ‘if you’re undecided, should you change your life?’ But this experiment can! I wish there were much more social science like this – for example, to figure out whether people should explore more or less in their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widely reported headline result was that &lt;strong&gt;people who made a change in their life as a result of the coin flip were 0.48 points happier out of 10, than those who maintained the status quo&lt;/strong&gt;. If the assumptions of this so-called ‘instrumental variables’ experiment hold up, and it’s reasonable to think they mostly do, that would be the actual &lt;em&gt;causal&lt;/em&gt; effect of making the change rather than just a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we actually read the paper we can learn much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This average benefit was entirely driven by people who made changes on important issues (‘Should I move’) rather than less important ones (‘Should I splurge’). &lt;strong&gt;People who made a change on an important question gained 2.2 points of happiness out of 10&lt;/strong&gt;, while those who made a change on a unimportant question were no more or less happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also dig deeper and see which specific changes people particularly benefited from. Stick with me for a moment. The study says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remaining rows of Table 3 present results for individual questions. These coefficients are not precisely estimated and are statistically significant in only a few instances. Job quitting and breaking up both carry very large, positive, and statistically significant coefficients at six months. Going on a diet is positive and statistically significant at two months, but has a small and insignificant impact by six months. Online dating is positive and significant at the 0.10 level at two months, but turns negative by six months. Splurging is negative and significant at the 0.10 level at two months, but has no discernible impact by six months. Attempting to break a bad habit is negative with a t-stat of 1.5 at both points in time, perhaps because breaking bad habits is so hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so job quitting and breaking up both have “very large, positive, and statistically significant coefficients at six months”. How big? Ludicrously, insanely big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The causal effect of quitting a job is estimated to be a gain of 5.2 happiness points out of 10, and breaking up as a gain of 2.7 out of 10!&lt;/strong&gt; This is the kind of welfare jump you might expect if you moved from one of the least happiness countries in the world to one of the happiest, though presumably these effects would fade over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are significant at the p=0.04 level, and fortunately I don’t think Levitt had many if any opportunities for specification mining here to artificially drive down the p value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the full results from table 3 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w22487.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; here. I’ve put the key numbers in the red box (standard errors are in parentheses):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much can we trust these findings? On the plus side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a nearly-experimental result (using the coin toss as a sort of ‘intention to treat’).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specification is therefore simple and transparent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results are statistically significant and pass some robustness checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sign of the result (positive) is plausible on its face, being explained by status-quo bias and risk-aversion. However, the magnitudes are unexpectedly large, and so more likely than not a chance overestimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levitt looks for indications of some forms of bias (e.g. people being inclined to overstate their happiness when they obeyed the coin flip, or those who benefitted from the change being more likely to fill out follow-up surveys) and finds little evidence for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The findings are corroborated by i) survey responses from friends who also reported that the people who changed their lives really did seem happier, ii) the broader picture of people making other important changes in their life also being more likely to report higher happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the ledger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If these results weren’t so big I probably wouldn’t have written this post, and people might have not have shared it with you on social media, so there’s a publication bias in how they are reaching you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a multiple-testing problem. The effects of many different kinds of life changes were tested, and I’m reporting the largest figures to you. This biases the results upwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This experiment was mostly done on people who were aware of the Freakonomics Podcast, and might not generalise to other populations. However, that population is probably similar in many ways to the kinds of people who would continue reading this blog post up to this point.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve noticed young people in my social circles seem very willing to change projects every 6-24 months, and I’ve wondered if this could sometimes make it hard for them to complete anything of value. Their desire to have a large social impact may make them more flighty than the people in this experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particularly important point on the question of generalisability is that almost all of the benefit seemed to go to people who earned over $50,000 a year, who are presumably in a better position to weather volatility in their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s possible people who were more likely to benefit from changing were more likely to be influenced by the coin toss, which would bias the results upwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost none of these effects were present at 2 months, which is suspicious given how large they were at 6 months. Maybe in the short run making changes of this kind doesn’t make you happier, because you have to deal with the initial challenges of e.g. finding a new job, or being single. We are left to wonder how long the gains will last, and whether they could even reverse themselves later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inasmuch as some assumptions of the experiment (e.g. people who would have benefited more from changing aren’t more likely to respond to follow-up emails) don’t entirely hold, the effect size would be reduced and perhaps be less impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this question of reliability, Levitt says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of these results are subject to the important caveats that the research subjects who chose to participate in the study are far from representative, there may be sample selection in which coin tossers complete the surveys, and responses might not be truthful. I consider a wide range of possible sources of bias and where feasible explore these biases empirically, concluding that it is likely that the first-stage estimates (i.e. the effect of the coin toss on decisions made) represent an upper bound. There is less reason to believe, however, that there are strong biases in the 2SLS estimates (i.e. the causal impact of the decision on self-reported happiness).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On balance I think this is a good, though not decisive, piece of evidence in favour of making changes in your life, and specifically quitting your job or breaking up, when you feel genuinely very unsure whether you should. At least for those who earn over $50,000 and whose goal is is happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
