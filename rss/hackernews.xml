<title>New Game: Minecraft Earth</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Picture the scene: you’re walking through your neighbourhood and see a patch of grass. Grass is lovely and all, but you see this patch &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. It’s getting a little dull and is practically &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; for a talented builder to brighten it up. So you take out your phone and craft a beautiful Minecraft build on a nearby picnic table. Then you place your colourful new Minecraft creation on the real-life grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve just used the power of &lt;strong&gt;augmented reality&lt;/strong&gt; to bring the Minecraft universe into our universe, making it a bit more block-tastic. Nicely done! Also, er, how did you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our new mobile game, &lt;strong&gt;Minecraft Earth!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel vulnerabilities costing 25% CPU performance loss to a Cloud Provider</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;e AMD stores all access bit in their cpu TLB. Like rwx, user, OS, supervisor ect.... and checks them before speculative executing anything you should not get any kind leaks across protection domains like Intel. still does not prevent spectre like leaks, but those are more minor.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why play a music CD? No ads, no privacy terrors, no algorithms</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/personaltech/music-streaming-cd.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/personaltech/music-streaming-cd.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ben Sisario, a reporter who covers the music industry, discussed the tech he’s using.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;What are your most important tech tools for doing your reporting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Probably 75 percent of my reporting is done by phone and email, and when I am writing I print out drafts and notes. So that part of it is about as current as 1995. But I also use Signal and ProtonMail for sources who require secure communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I constantly scan social media — Twitter, mostly — for news, and in breaking news situations I sometimes find sources to quote there. But I am wary of letting social media itself tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;You need to actually talk to people, check facts, find contrary viewpoints, weed out nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When it comes to organizing my work, I think cloud computing is the greatest thing since the manila folder. I have 15-plus years of notes instantly searchable through Dropbox and Google Docs. It’s amazing to type in five characters and find that phone number from an obit you wrote a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And then there are sites like WhoSampled and Discogs, incredible repositories of information that are deeply addictive for music nerds like me. My time there often starts with legitimate research — say, checking the original writing credit on an old single — but then an hour later I’ve spent $50 on vinyl and reminded myself of the slide whistle sample on “Groove Is in the Heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Information on sites like WhoSampled and Discogs is “deeply addictive for music nerds like me,” said Mr. Sisario, working at Grainne Cafe in Manhattan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;What does your music setup look like, and how has it evolved over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I try to keep an eye on all the major platforms out there, which means regularly poking around on about a dozen apps. My go-to sources are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/business/media/spotify-100-million-subscribers-apple-podcasts.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fben-sisario&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, SoundCloud, Bandcamp and Mixcloud, which has excellent D.J.-style mixes and to me feels more human than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At home I have a Sonos Play:5 speaker, which plays streaming music and podcasts, and is a piece of cake to use. I also have Google Chromecast Audio, a little plug-in device (now discontinued) that allows me to send high-fidelity streams to my stereo. It sounds better that way, but it’s not nearly as easy to use as the Sonos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To be honest, my preferred way to listen to music is on CD, as unfashionable as that might be. You push a button, the music plays, and then it’s over — no ads, no privacy terrors, no algorithms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;What are the pros and cons of the streaming model for musicians big and small?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The big positive is the vast potential exposure. Streaming eliminated the cost barrier to sampling new music, and playlists constantly put new songs in front of people. Theoretically, at least, there are more chances than ever for a song to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But, as they say, you can die of exposure. Megahits still generate millions of dollars in royalties, and Spotify’s official mission statement is “giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet for artists beneath the megahit level — and that is the vast majority of them — the jury is still out. I’ve seen royalty statements for well-known indie acts that suggest they can earn a decent middle-class living from their streams. I’ve also talked to very successful songwriters who say their income has been decimated by streaming and by the new model for pop songwriting, in which five or six — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/07/magazine/top-songs.html?module=inline#/travis-scott&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;or 30&lt;/a&gt; — people divvy up the same sliver of royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In general, though, I’m optimistic about streaming and its potential. It has reinvigorated the music industry and made listening a lot easier, more fun and more dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Sisario doesn’t see the battle between Spotify and Apple as having a big effect on streaming music. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Apple and Spotify have been fighting publicly over antitrust issues. Where is this fight going, and what impact might it have on streaming music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I tend to think of this as mostly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/spotify-apple-complaint.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fben-sisario&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a matter of corporate warfare&lt;/a&gt;. These companies are in a race for market dominance around the world, and the gloves are off. For Spotify, anything that hinders Apple, even a little, can provide an advantage. On the other hand, Apple’s gigantic size means it will always be on the defensive against regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I don’t see these issues having a big effect on streaming music. Competition in this market has benefited consumers, and as much as Spotify accuses Apple of anticompetitive practices, it has still signed up far more users — both free and paid — than Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;What emerging tech trends might change the way people listen to music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A great deal of attention is being paid to smart speakers like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/what-is-alexa-what-is-the-amazon-echo-and-should-you-get-one/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Alexa&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that genuinely feels futuristic: walking into a room and saying, “Play relaxation playlist” or “Play NPR news,” and it just happens. I think we’re still in the early stages of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video sharing apps like TikTok&lt;/a&gt; are also having a palpable effect on music, and I think that will only grow. TikTok makes it easy to generate video memes using music, and these are fast moving and viral by nature. The best example is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fben-sisario&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road,”&lt;/a&gt; which was a TikTok sensation well before it hit the pop charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Something in the way TikTok spreads music virally, Mr. Sisario said, is proving transformative when songs like “Old Town Road” come together. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Not to be too much of a grouch, but for me it is more about an opposite kind of phenomenon: What formerly hyped, supposedly essential technology has since been exposed for gross privacy violations, or for how easily it has become a tool for predatory disinformation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Way too many of them, of course, but the really dispiriting thing is realizing that it is nearly impossible to disengage. We have become only more conscious of the risks and dangers surrounding us at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That said, in my house we are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/instant-pot-electric-pressure-cooker-recipes.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;really happy with our Instant Pot Duo&lt;/a&gt;, a beeping digital pressure cooker that makes perfect biriyani or chicken soup in like five minutes. I really hope it is not collecting any private data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hertz bug leads to people being erroneously arrested and jailed</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-head&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;Cleaning fees could be the least of your worries if your next car rental is from Hertz.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hero-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image-fade-in&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://the-drive-3.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fapi.thedrive.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-483334506.jpg%3Fquality%3D85?q=70&amp;amp;w=1440&amp;amp;ixlib=js-1.2.1&amp;amp;s=b34e986854f571640f90057f58ff2266&quot; srcset=&quot;https://the-drive-3.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fapi.thedrive.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-483334506.jpg%3Fquality%3D85?q=70&amp;amp;w=1440&amp;amp;ixlib=js-1.2.1&amp;amp;s=b34e986854f571640f90057f58ff2266 1x,https://the-drive-3.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fapi.thedrive.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-483334506.jpg%3Fquality%3D85?q=70&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;ixlib=js-1.2.1&amp;amp;s=7c495430ec3d125b20f73e6e0dd2ba55 1.5x&quot; onload=&quot;this.style.opacity=1&quot;/&gt;Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of Hertz customers finding themselves in hot water after renting a vehicle from the Florida-based company are on the rise, and the culprit appears to be a faulty computer system and poor office management. The majority of the cases claim Hertz reported vehicles stolen to the police when they were actually being legitimately rented by customers, causing major issues for the renters and anyone unlucky enough to be riding with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/hertz-has-a-pattern-of-mistakenly-reporting-cars-stolen-leaving-customers-arrested-attorney-says&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC Action News&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; these affected customers ended up in handcuffs and in the back of a police car in the majority of the cases. A few people were even met with the business ends of a firearm and were taken into custody forcefully after disagreeing with police. Some actually endured the terrible experience of spending a few hours in jail—but a few either spent considerable time behind bars— once case resulting in two weeks in prison. However, almost every time, erroneously charged renters are still fighting the charges they received in court and all the fines that come along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/news/22883/you-can-now-rent-the-650-horsepower-chevrolet-corvette-z06-from-hertz&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; manages tens of millions of rentals each year, which makes these 30 or so stories exceptionally rare, but not any less bizarre. The recent claims don't explain how exactly these mix-ups happen, but some of the renters reported switching vehicles, upgrading cars, or reporting mechanical issues before being approached by the law. One driver returned a vehicle for a flat tire and was given another to drive instead, and when the company did not complete paperwork for the second vehicle, the car was reported stolen and the police got involved. Another driver was alerted to an expired registration on her rental but was ultimately arrested before she could even return the car a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis Alexander, an attorney who is representing some of the falsely-accused renters, says that Hertz’s computer system has a “glitch” that has led to the company-wide pattern of reporting cars stolen. He says there are upwards of 30 cases across the country, and the issue is not a new one. Some of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://6abc.com/business/hertz-customers-arrested-after-vehicles-mistakenly-reported-stolen/3487977/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;were reported&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Hertz found itself paying tens of thousands of dollars in damages to victims in civil cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that your next rental with Hertz may not earn you bonus points or credit card miles, but a permanent stamp on your criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The struggles of an open source maintainer</title>

<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;129&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;129-&quot; id=&quot;129-&quot; readability=&quot;78.940261423787&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 22 hours ago. 55916 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Months ago the maintainer of an OSS project in the sphere of system software, with quite a big and active community, wrote me an email saying that he struggles to continue maintaining his project after so many years, because of how much psychologically taxing such effort is. He was looking for advices from me, I’m not sure to be in the position of giving advices, however I told him I would write a blog post about what I think about the matter. Several weeks passed, and multiple times I started writing such post and stopped, because I didn’t had the time to process the ideas for enough time. Now I think I was able to analyze myself to find answers inside my own weakness, struggles, and desire of freedom, that inevitably invades the human minds when they do some task, that also has some negative aspect, for a prolonged amount of time. Maintaining an open source project is also a lot of joy and fun and these latest ten years of my professional life are surely memorable, even if not the absolute best (I had more fun during my startup times after all). However here I’ll focus on the negative side; simply make sure you don’t get the feeling it is just that, there is also a lot of good in it.

Flood effect

I don’t believe in acting fast, thinking fast, winning the competition on time and stuff like that. I don’t like the world of constant lack of focus we live in, because of social networks, chats, emails, and a schedule full of activities. So when I used to receive an email about Redis back in the early times of the project, when I still had plenty of time, I was able to focus on what the author of the message was trying to tell me. Then I could recall the relevant part of Redis we were discussing, and finally reply with my real thoughts, after considering the matter with care. I believe this is how most people should work regardless of what their job is.

When a software project reaches the popularity Redis reached, and at the same time once the communications between individuals are made so simple by the new social tools, and by your attitude to be “there” for users, the amount of messages, issues, pull requests, suggestions the authors receive will grow exponentially. At the same time, at least in the case of Redis, but I believe this to be a common problem, the amount of very qualified people that can look at such inputs from the community grows very slowly. This creates an obvious congestion. Most people try to address it in the wrong way: using pragmatism. Let’s close the issue after two weeks of no original poster replies, after we ask some question. Close all the issues that are not very well specified. And other “inbox zero” solutions. The reality is that to process community feedbacks very well you have to take the time needed, otherwise you will just pretend your project has a small number of open issues. Having a lot of resources to hire core-level experts for each Redis subsystem, to work at OSS full time, would work but is not feasible.

So what happens? That you start to prioritize more and more what to look at and what not. And you feel you are a piece of shit at ignoring so many things and people, and also the contributor believes you don’t care about what others have to give you. It’s a complex situation. Usually the end result is to develop an attitude to mostly address critical issues and disregard all the new stuff, since new stuff are yet not in the core, and who wants to have a larger code base with even more PRs and issues there? Maybe also written in a more convoluted way compared to your usual programming style, so, more complexity, and good luck when there is a critical bug there to track the root cause.

Role shifting

As a result of the “flood effect” problem exposed above, you suddenly also change job. Redis became popular because I supposedly am able to design and write software. And now instead most of the work I do is to look at issues and pull requests, and I also feel that I could do better many of the contributions I receive. Some will be better quality than I could do, because there are also better programmers than me contributing to Redis, but *most* for the nature of big numbers will be average contributions that are just written to solve a given problem that was contingent for the folks that submitted it. While, when I design for Redis, I tend to think at Redis as a whole, because it’s years I write this thing. So what you were good at, you have no longer time to do. This in turn means less organic big new features. My solution with that? Sometimes I just stop looking at issues and PRs for weeks, because I’m coding or designing: that is the work I really love and enjoy. However this in turn creates ways more pressure on me, psychologically. To do what I love and I can do well I’ve to feel like shit.

Time

There are two problems related to working at the same project for a prolonged amount of time, at least for me.
First, before of the Redis experience I *never* worked every week day of my life. I could work one week, stop two, then work one month, then disappear for other two months. Always. People need to recharge, get new energy and ideas, to do creative work. And programming at high level is a fucking creative job. Redis itself was created like that for the first two years, that is, when the project evolved at the fastest speed. Because the sum of the productivity of me working just when I want is greater than the productivity I’ve when I’m forced to work every day in a steady way.

However my work ethics allowed me to have a very discontinue schedule when I was working alone with my companies. Once I started to receive money to work at Redis, it was no longer possible for my ethics to have my past pattern, so I started to force myself to work under normal schedules. This for me is a huge struggle, for many years at this point. Moreover I’m sure I’m doing less than I could because of that, but this is how things work. I never found a way to solve this problem. I could say Redis Labs that I want to return to my old schedule, but that would not work because at this point I really “report” to the community, not to the company.

Another problem is that working a lot at the same project is also a complex matter, mentally speaking. I used to change project every six months in the past. Now for ten years I did the same thing. In that regard I tried to save my sanity by having sub-projects inside Redis. One time I did Cluster, another time disk-storage (now abandoned), another was HyerLogLogs, and so forth. Basically things that bring value to the project but that, in isolation, are other stuff. But eventually you have to return back to the issues and PRs page and address the same things every day. “Replica is disconnecting because of a timeout” or whatever. Let’s investigate that again.

Fear

I always had some fear to lose the technological leadership of the project. Not because I think I’m not good enough at designing and evolving Redis, but because I know my ways are not aligned with: 1) what a sizable amount of users want. 2) what most people in IT believe software is. So I had to constantly balance between what I believe to be good design, set of features, speed of development (slow), size of the project (minimal), and what I was expected to deliver by most of the user base. Fortunately there is a percentage of Redis users that understand perfectly the Redis-way, so at least from time to time I can get some word of comfort.

Frictions

Certain people are total assholes. They are everywhere, it is natural and if you ask me, I even believe in programming there are a lot more nice people than in other fields. But yet you’ll always see a percentage of total jerks. As the leader of a popular OSS project, in one way or the other you’ll have to confront with these people, and that’s maybe one of the most stressful things I ever did in the course of the Redis development.

Futileness

Sometimes I believe that software, while great, will never be huge like writing a book that will survive for centuries. Note because it is not as great per-se, but because as a side effect it is also useful… and will be replaced when something more useful is around. I would like to have time to do other activities as well. So sometimes I believe all I’m doing is, in the end, futile. We’ll design and write systems, and new systems will emerge; but anyone that just stays in software, instead of staying in “software big ideas”, will ever set a new mark? From time to time I think I had potentially the ability to work at big ideas but because I focused on writing software instead of thinking about software, I was not able to use my potential in that regard. This is basically the contrary of the impostor syndrome, so I guess I’ve a big idea of myself: sorry for that I should be more humble.

That said, I was able to work for many years doing things I really loved, that gave me friends, recognition, money, so I don’t want to say it was a bad deal. Yet I totally understand people struggling a lot to stay afloat once their projects start to be popular. This blog post is dedicated to them.

<title>Faster Smarter JavaScript Debugging in Firefox DevTools</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/faster-smarter-javascript-debugging-in-firefox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/faster-smarter-javascript-debugging-in-firefox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Script debugging is one of the most powerful and complex productivity features in the web developer toolbox. Done right, it empowers developers to fix bugs quickly and efficiently. So the question for us, the Firefox DevTools team, has been, are the Firefox DevTools doing it right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been listening to feedback from our community. Above everything we heard the need for greater &lt;strong&gt;reliability&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt;; especially with modern web apps. Moreover, script debugging is a hard-to-learn skill that should work in similar fashion across browsers, but isn’t consistent because of feature and UI gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these pain points in mind, the DevTools Debugger team – with help from our tireless &lt;a href=&quot;https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;developer community&lt;/a&gt; – landed countless updates to design a more productive debugging experience. The work is ongoing, but Firefox 67 marks an important milestone, and we wanted to highlight some of the fantastic improvements and features. We invite you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/&quot;&gt;open up Firefox Quantum: Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt;, try out the debugger on the examples below and your projects and let us know if you notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A rock-solid debugging experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast and reliable debugging is the result of many smaller interactions. From initial loading and source mapping to breakpoints, console logging, and variable previews, everything needs to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; solid and responsive. The debugger should be consistent, predictable, and capable of understanding common tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can proudly say that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those areas have improved in the past months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster load time&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve eliminated the worst performance cliffs that made the debugger slow to open. This has resulted in a 30% speedup in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://firefox-dev.tools/performance-dashboard/tools/debugger.html?days=90&amp;amp;filterstddev=true&amp;amp;ignoreFlags=true&quot;&gt;performance test suite&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll share more of our performance adventures in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent source map support.&lt;/strong&gt; A revamped and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;faster&lt;/a&gt; source-map backend perfects the illusion that you’re debugging &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; code, not the compiled output from &lt;em&gt;Babel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Webpack&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TypeScript&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;vue.js&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Generating correct source maps can be challenging, so we also contributed patches to build tools (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8380&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/1163#issuecomment-384712864&quot;&gt;vue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7632&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/issues/342&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;regenerator&lt;/a&gt;) – benefiting the whole ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced overhead when debugger isn’t focused.&lt;/strong&gt; No need to worry any longer about keeping the DevTools open! We found and removed many expensive calculations from running in the debugger when it’s in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictable breakpoints, pausing, and stepping.&lt;/strong&gt; We fixed many long-standing bugs deep in the debugger architecture, solving some of the most common and frustrating issues related to lost breakpoints, pausing in the wrong script, or stepping through pretty-printed code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster variable preview.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to our faster source-map support (and lots of additional work), previews are now displayed much more quickly when you hover your mouse over a variable while execution is paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of highlights. We’ve also resolved countless &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22%3Abug%3A+bug%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22%3Awave%3A+polish%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;polish&lt;/a&gt; issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foremost, we must maintain a high standard of quality, which we’ll accomplish by explicitly setting aside time for polish in our planning. Guided by user feedback, we intend to use this time to improve new and existing features alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, continued investment in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://firefox-dev.tools/performance-dashboard/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/tree/master/src/workers/parser/tests/fixtures/frameworks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;correctness&lt;/a&gt; tests ensures that the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem, including a wide variety of frameworks and compiled languages, is well supported by our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debug all the things with new features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding and pausing in just the right location can be key to understanding a bug. This should feel effortless, so we’ve scrutinized our own tools—and studied others—to give you the best possible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inline breakpoints for fine-grained pausing and stepping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/inline-bps.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33484 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/inline-bps.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Inline handlers are the perfect match for the extra granularity.&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;484&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should breakpoints operate on lines, when lines can have multiple statements? Thanks to inline breakpoints, it’s now easier than ever to debug minified scripts, arrow functions, and chained method calls. Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Set_a_breakpoint&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;breakpoints on MDN&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://firefox-devtools-example-babel-typescript.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;try out the demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logpoints combine the power of Console and Debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/logpoints.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33483 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/logpoints.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Adding Logpoints to monitor application state.&quot; width=&quot;928&quot; height=&quot;610&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Console logging, also called &lt;code&gt;printf() debugging&lt;/code&gt;, is a quick and easy way to observe your program’s flow, but it rapidly becomes tedious. Logpoints break that tiresome edit-build-refresh cycle by dynamically injecting &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; statements into your running application. You can stay in the browser and monitor variables without pausing or editing any code.

&lt;h3&gt;Seamless debugging for JavaScript Workers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API&quot;&gt;Web Workers&lt;/a&gt; power the modern web and need to be first-class concepts in DevTools. Using the new &lt;em&gt;Threads&lt;/em&gt; panel, you can switch between and independently pause different execution contexts. This allows workers and their scripts to be debugged within the same Debugger panel, similarly to other modern browsers.

&lt;p&gt;Debugging bundled and compressed code isn’t easy. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/source-map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Source Maps&lt;/a&gt; project, started and maintained by Firefox, bridges the gap between minified code running in the browser and its original, human-friendly version, but the translation isn’t perfect. Often, bits of the minified build output shine through and break the illusion. We can do better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33487 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping.png&quot; alt=&quot;From build output back to original human-readable variables&quot; width=&quot;1818&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping.png 1818w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping-250x74.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping-768x226.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/Scope-Mapping-500x147.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1818px) 100vw, 1818px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining source maps with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser&quot;&gt;Babel parser&lt;/a&gt;, Firefox’s Debugger can now preview the original variables you care about, and hide the extraneous cruft from compilers and bundlers. This can even work in the console, automatically resolving human-friendly identifiers to their actual, minified names behind the scenes. Due to its performance overhead, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Using_the_Debugger_map_scopes_feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;enable this feature&lt;/a&gt; separately by clicking the “Map” checkbox in the Debugger’s &lt;em&gt;Scopes&lt;/em&gt; panel. Read the MDN documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Using_the_Debugger_map_scopes_feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;using the map scopes feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers frequently need to switch between browsers to ensure that the web works for everyone, and we want our DevTools to be an intuitive, seamless experience. Though browsers have converged on the same broad organization for tools, we know there are still gaps in both features and UI. To help us address those gaps, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=DevTools&amp;amp;component=Debugger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; where you experience friction when switching browsers in your daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your input makes a big difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we would love to hear your feedback on how we can improve DevTools and the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all these updates will be ready to try out in Firefox 67, when it’s released next week, we’ve polished them to perfection in Firefox 68 and added a few more goodies. Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/&quot;&gt;Firefox Developer Edition (68)&lt;/a&gt; to try the latest updates for devtools and platform now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can we all stop using Medium now?</title>

<description>&lt;header class=&quot;blog-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-readingtime&quot;&gt;2 minute read.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blog-author&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/pastaduck&quot;&gt;Paul Anthony&lt;/a&gt; / May 16, 2019&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;article readability=&quot;39.135007105637&quot;&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;blog-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;blog-category&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posted in:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webdistortion.com/category/opinion/&quot; rel=&quot;category tag&quot;&gt;Opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium is cancer. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webdistortion.com/2015/10/13/is-medium-just-another-trojan-horse-social-platform/&quot;&gt;trojan horse&lt;/a&gt;. It’s Facebook. But for blogging. A walled garden behind which all your favourite content lives, and yet you are forced to login via their shitty UI, or worse still pay for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did reading stuff on the web become pay to play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you when. When we all got greedy looking for the attention our blogs &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to get until social media came along. Or when we got greedy looking for coinage off the onetruecontentsource™. If you enjoy reading on the web chances are you’ve been forced to login to Medium at some point in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have any of you noticed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/907266693638041600&quot;&gt;dark UI patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I bet you did. I’m guessing you noticed smart &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1127981912755040256&quot;&gt;programmers&lt;/a&gt;  / &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MichaelAleo/status/1127986056849182720&quot;&gt;designers&lt;/a&gt; / internet celebs tweeting about how shit it is. Maybe someone you respect continually &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1048265494858481664&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; their accessibility failures. Maybe you nodded your head in agreement. Maybe you even retweeted it. Go you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so we are clear. Medium takes your content, rolls it up into a pretty SEO friendly package for themselves and sells it. Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlternativeStr8/status/1129073256265338880&quot;&gt;turns us all into seals&lt;/a&gt; waiting for someone to throw us a fish in the process. If you are lucky, you might even get a cut. You know. Like the sort of cut artists get on Spotify. Profit share I think the cool kids call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is everyone still publishing on it? For what? More eyeballs? More attention? More reach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balls to that. If only one of you read this I’ll be happy. At least I own my own platform and I’m not being controlled by some monolithic publishing giant that can do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoshuaRowe11/status/1128859059099062272&quot;&gt;whatever they want&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webdistortion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-16-at-23.51.53.png&quot;&gt;sell whatever advertising they please&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ON YOUR HARD WORK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please. It’s 2019. Learn to market yourself and your content. Quit being lazy waiting for Medium to do it for you. &lt;strong&gt;OWN YOUR PLATFORM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don’t get me started on the mini publications that we all jump for fucking joy over being published on. How’s about no. How’s about we starting taking responsibility for the absolute decimation of the traditional web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know. That old internet that used to be open and free.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I.M. Pei has died</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/obituaries/im-pei-dead.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I. M. Pei, who began his long career designing buildings for a New York real estate developer and ended it as one of the most revered architects in the world, died early Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His death was confirmed by his son Li Chung Pei, who is also an architect and known as Sandi. He said his father had recently celebrated his birthday with a family dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Best known for designing the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/arts/pei-pyramid-and-new-louvre-open-today.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;glass pyramid at the entrance to the Louvre&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, Mr. Pei was one of the few architects who were equally attractive to real estate developers, corporate chieftains and art museum boards (the third group, of course, often made up of members of the first two). And all of his work — from his commercial skyscrapers to his art museums — represented a careful balance of the cutting edge and the conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei’s addition to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, known as the East Building, is made from massive blocks of Tennessee marble arranged around a triangular courtyard. It was a rare example of a modernist structure that appeared so permanent and well crafted that even lovers of traditional architecture were smitten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carol M. Highsmith/Buyenlarge, via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/arts/design/im-pei-buildings.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;See six of I.M. Pei’s most important buildings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei remained a committed modernist, and while none of his buildings could ever be called old-fashioned or traditional, his particular brand of modernism — clean, reserved, sharp-edged and unapologetic in its use of simple geometries and its aspirations to monumentality — sometimes seemed to be a throwback, at least when compared with the latest architectural trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This hardly bothered him. What he valued most in architecture, he said, was that it “stand the test of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He maintained that he wanted not just to solve problems but also to produce “an architecture of ideas.” He worried, he added, “that ideas and professional practice do not intersect enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei (pronounced pay), who was born in China and moved to the United States in the 1930s, was hired by William Zeckendorf in 1948, shortly after he received his graduate degree in architecture from Harvard, to oversee the design of buildings produced by Zeckendorf’s firm, Webb &amp;amp; Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;President Jimmy Carter dedicated the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1978. He was joined by, from left, Carter Brown, director of the gallery; Mr. Pei; Bunny Mellon, whose family donated money for the structure; and Joan Mondale, wife of Vice President Walter F. Mondale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At a time when most of his Harvard classmates considered themselves fortunate to get to design a single-family house or two, Mr. Pei quickly found himself engaged in the design of high-rise buildings, and he used that experience as a springboard to establish his own firm, I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates, which he set up in 1955 with Henry Cobb and Eason Leonard, the team he had assembled at Webb &amp;amp; Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In its early years, I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates mainly executed projects for Zeckendorf, including Kips Bay Plaza in New York, finished in 1963; Society Hill Towers in Philadelphia (1964); and Silver Towers in New York (1967). All were notable for their gridded concrete facades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The firm became fully independent from Webb &amp;amp; Knapp in 1960, by which time Mr. Pei, a cultivated man whose understated manner and easy charm masked an intense, competitive ambition, was winning commissions for major projects that had nothing to do with Zeckendorf. Among these were the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., completed in 1967, and the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse and the Des Moines Art Center, both finished in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They were the first in a series of museums he designed that would come to include the East Building (1978) and the Louvre pyramid (1989) as well as the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/arts/architecture-view-a-shrine-to-rock-music-with-a-roll-all-its-own.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, for which he designed what amounted to a huge glass tent in 1995. It was perhaps his most surprising commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The National Gallery project helped Mr. Pei win the commission to renovate the Louvre in Paris. The 70-foot-high glass pyramid appalled preservationists, but the public eventually warmed to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Claude Paris/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei, not a rock ’n’ roll fan, initially turned down that job. After he changed his mind, he prepared for the challenge of expressing the spirit of the music by traveling to rock concerts with Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Cleveland project would not be Mr. Pei’s last unlikely museum commission: His museum oeuvre would culminate in the call to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/arts/design/14ouro.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;design the Museum of Islamic Art&lt;/a&gt;, in Doha, Qatar, in 2008, a challenge Mr. Pei accepted with relish. A longtime collector of Western Abstract Expressionist art, he admitted to knowing little about Islamic art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As with the rock museum, Mr. Pei saw the Qatar commission as an opportunity to learn about a culture he did not claim to understand. He began his research by reading a biography of the Prophet Muhammad, and then commenced a tour of great Islamic architecture around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5ebf9f91&quot;&gt;Bold Yet Pragmatic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the waffle-like concrete facades of the Zeckendorf buildings were an early signature of his, Mr. Pei soon moved beyond concrete to a more sculptural but equally modernist approach. Throughout his long career he combined a willingness to use bold, assertive forms with a pragmatism born in his years with Zeckendorf, and he alternated between designing commercial projects and making a name for himself in other architectural realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, one of Mr. Pei’s most surprising commissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Duncan/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Besides his many art museums, he designed concert halls, academic structures, hospitals, office towers and civic buildings like the Dallas City Hall, completed in 1977; the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, finished in 1979; and the Guggenheim Pavilion of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, finished in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;(I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates eventually became I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Partners and later named Pei, Cobb and Freed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Mr. Pei was invited to design the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, he had the opportunity to demonstrate his belief that modernism was capable of producing buildings with the gravitas, the sense of permanence and the popular appeal of the greatest traditional structures. When the building opened in 1978, Ada Louise Huxtable, the senior architecture critic of The New York Times, hailed it as the most important building of the era, and she called Mr. Pei, at least by implication, the pre-eminent architect of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most other critics also praised Mr. Pei’s angular structure of glass and marble, constructed out of the same Tennessee marble as John Russell Pope’s original National Gallery Building of 1941, reshaped into a building of crisp, angular forms set around a triangular courtyard. Mr. Pei, many critics said, had found a way to get beyond both the casual, temporal air and the coldness of much modern architecture, and to create a building that was both boldly monumental and warmly inviting, even exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The Bank of China building, center, in Hong Kong was designed by Mr. Pei to look like an angular bamboo shoot.

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1979, the year after the National Gallery was completed, Mr. Pei received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects, its highest honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the same time that he was receiving plaudits in Washington, however, Mr. Pei was recovering from one of the most devastating setbacks any architect of his generation had faced anywhere: the nearly total failure of one of his most conspicuous projects, the 700-foot-tall John Hancock Tower at Copley Square in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A thin, elegant slab of bluish glass designed by his partner Henry Cobb, it was nearing completion in 1973 when sheets of glass began popping out of its facade. They were quickly replaced with plywood, but before the source of the problem could be detected, nearly a third of the glass had fallen out, creating both a professional embarrassment and an enormous legal liability for Mr. Pei and his firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The fault, experts believed, was not in the Pei design but in the glass itself: The Hancock Tower was one of the first high-rise buildings to use a new type of reflective, double-paned glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei was far from the obvious choice to design the Kennedy library and museum, but when Jacqueline Kennedy visited him in his office in 1964, she was so impressed by his erudition and elegant manners that she chose him on the spot. At a meeting of trustees and directors of the library, Mr. Pei shared a laugh with Mrs. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eddie Hausner/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The building ultimately won numerous awards, including the American Institute of Architects’ 25-Year Award. But it took eight years of legal wrangling, millions of dollars and the replacement of all 10,344 panes of glass in the facade before the Hancock’s troubles could be put to rest and the building could be appreciated as one of the most beautiful skyscrapers of the late 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The problems delayed its opening by three years, its temporary plywood windows a constant reminder to all Boston of its troubles, which cost I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Partners so many clients that Mr. Pei almost had to close the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The glass company had a lot of money, and Hancock had a lot of money, but we didn’t have a lot of money,” he told The Times in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The long struggle to resolve the problems at the Hancock, and the fallout from the crisis, made the 1970s, despite the triumph of the National Gallery in Washington, a bittersweet decade for Mr. Pei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Although he was correct that his firm lacked the funds of the huge corporations he was struggling with, he was not without substantial resources, at least for an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-13e1f92c&quot;&gt;Son of a Banker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ieoh Ming Pei was born in Canton (now Guangzhou) on April 26, 1917, the son of Tsuyee Pei, one of China’s leading bankers. When he was an infant, his father moved the family to Hong Kong to assume the head position at the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, and when Ieoh Ming was 9, his father was put in charge of the larger branch in Shanghai. He remembered being fascinated by the construction of a 25-story hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I couldn’t resist looking into the hole,” he recalled in 2007. “That’s when I knew I wanted to build.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Deciding to attend college in the United States, he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. But when he concluded that he was not up to the classical drawing techniques then being taught at Penn, he transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he received a bachelor of architecture degree in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the recommendation of his father, who was concerned about the threat of war and the growing possibility of a Communist revolution in China, he postponed his plan to return home. Instead he enrolled at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard, where he studied under the German modernist architect Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Discovering that there were relatively few men at Harvard during the war years — “It was me, a Chinese national, and the ladies,” he once recalled — he decided to join the war effort and volunteered to work for the National Defense Research Committee in Princeton, N.J., where he became an expert on fusing bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They figured if you knew how to build buildings, you knew how to destroy them,” Mr. Pei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While he was at M.I.T., Mr. Pei met another Chinese national, Eileen Loo, who had come to the United States in 1938 to study art at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Like Mr. Pei, she was from a distinguished Chinese family. The two married as soon as she graduated, in 1942. Eileen Pei began graduate work in landscape architecture at Harvard while her husband worked toward his advanced architecture degree, which he received in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei designed large, publicly subsidized projects like Kips Bay Towers (1963), a Manhattan complex whose gridded, poured-in-place concrete facades proved, he said, that concrete was an acceptable material for large-scale urban housing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bob Glass/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He taught briefly at Harvard and planned to return to China in time. But then he was approached by Zeckendorf, who was looking for a talented young architect to head a new in-house design team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei, refined and genteel, could not have been more different on the surface from the brash Zeckendorf. But the men shared a bold ambition, a love of French wine and a belief that architecture could improve cities. Mr. Pei decided to make the move to New York. He, his wife and their two young sons left Cambridge, Mass., and settled in an apartment on Beekman Place in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Zeckendorf years were a heady beginning for Mr. Pei’s career. Before long he had hired one of his former students at Harvard, Henry Cobb, who would remain associated with him for more than 60 years. The architect Ulrich Franzen also began his career working under Mr. Pei at Webb &amp;amp; Knapp, where the architecture department had charge of large-scale projects in New York, Washington, Montreal, Denver, Boston and other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No matter how committed William Zeckendorf was to Mr. Pei’s designs, however, he was still a commercial real estate developer, and Mr. Pei did not want to spend his entire career working for someone else. With Zeckendorf’s blessing he began to seek some outside commissions, including the Luce Memorial Chapel in Taiwan and the Green Earth Sciences building at M.I.T., and he gradually began to separate himself from his patron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;One of Mr. Pei’s earliest works was The Silver Towers at New York University, part of what he called his “concrete series.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Zeckendorf’s empire ran into serious financial problems in 1960, that became a good excuse to turn I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates into a fully independent firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-410eb51&quot;&gt;The Choice of the Kennedys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei quickly began to gather both large and small architectural assignments, among them the National Airlines terminal at what is now John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, the Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University, and the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library in Columbus, Ind., a city famous for its architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the commission that truly thrust Mr. Pei into the forefront of American architects was for a building that would take 15 years to build and would bring him a sense of triumph and frustration in equal parts: the John F. Kennedy Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was chosen in 1964 by Jacqueline Kennedy (later Onassis), who liked the fact that he was young — he and John F. Kennedy were born just a month apart — and only beginning to come into his own. His selection over Louis Kahn, Philip Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft and Paul Rudolph made it clear that he was no longer viewed as a developer’s architect but as a major talent on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But political objections to the library’s original site in Cambridge delayed the project for years, and by the time it was built, both the new site, at Columbia Point in Boston Harbor, and the scaled-down design represented major compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the years the Kennedy Library was being planned, the Pei firm grew rapidly. There were still more museums, like the Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University, and large urban complexes like the Christian Science Center in Boston, as well as the project that would bring Mr. Pei his greatest notoriety in Boston, the John Hancock Tower, and the museum that would bring him his greatest acclaim, the East Building of the National Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As his firm grew in size and prestige — it would eventually employ 300 people — Mr. Pei seemed to become the quintessential New Yorker. He and his wife and family, which grew to include three sons and a daughter, moved to a townhouse on Sutton Place, facing the East River, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became an avid collector of postwar American art, and his townhouse contained works by Morris Louis, Dubuffet and de Kooning; he also designed a weekend house for his family in Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where he installed a 16-foot-high sculpture by Anthony Caro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei never played down his connections to China. His children were all given Chinese names, and when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1983, widely viewed as the highest honor a living architect can receive, he used the $100,000 award to establish a scholarship fund for Chinese architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In addition to his son Li Chung, who is known as Sandi, he is survived by another son, Chien Chung, also an architect, who is known as Didi; his daughter, Liane; and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei’s younger sons joined with him to form their own firm, the Pei Partnership, in 1992, at which point I. M. Pei began stepping aside from the firm he had founded and devoted most of the last years of his career to working with his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He did not go back to China until 1974, when he returned as part of a cultural exchange tour organized by the American Institute of Architects. There, he did not hesitate to criticize the banal, Soviet-influenced architecture that he saw, and he gave a talk in which he urged the Chinese to look back at their own traditions rather than “slavishly following Eastern European patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The criticism did not deter the Chinese government from inviting Mr. Pei, by then the most famous Chinese-born architect in the world, back again, this time to design a group of high-rise hotels in the center of Beijing. He declined, saying that he feared such buildings would deface the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The government, not willing to let him get away so easily, then offered him a rural site outside the city and asked him to design a resort hotel there. This time he said yes, and produced the design for Fragrant Hill, a sprawling building in which he tried to combine the geometric modernism of his other buildings with elements from traditional Chinese architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was the first of a few attempts Mr. Pei made to acknowledge the growing interest of many architects in reusing historical form; in a similar vein, he would later design a high-rise hotel in Midtown Manhattan, the Regent (now the Four Seasons), which tried to evoke the romantic, stepped-back forms of prewar New York skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The opening of Fragrant Hill was a major international event. Jacqueline Onassis, whose friendship with Mr. Pei remained strong throughout the years of delay over the Kennedy Library, attended, as did Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery. But Mr. Pei later admitted that he considered the building, which was poorly constructed and not well maintained, a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1982, Mr. Pei would have a very different kind of opportunity in China when the governors of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, the bank his father had once run, traveled to New York to meet with Tsuyee Pei, who had long since left China and was living in Manhattan. Their mission was to ask the senior Pei, in a demonstration of traditional Chinese etiquette, if he would agree to allow them to invite his son to design a new skyscraper headquarters for the bank in Hong Kong. (Tsuyee Pei was bitterly opposed to the Communist Chinese government, but he did not stand in the way of his son’s taking the job.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei would make his biggest international mark, however, in France, with a smaller but far more contentious project. In the early 1980s President François Mitterrand, an admirer of the East Building at the National Gallery, invited Mr. Pei to update and expand the Louvre Museum, which was sorely in need of renovation to accommodate a huge increase in visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei proposed building a glass pyramid in the center of the ancient Cour Napoleon to serve as a new main entrance to the museum. He quickly found himself in the center of an international controversy, accused of defacing one of the world’s great landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He argued that his glass pyramid was merely an updated version of a traditional form, and that his redesigned courtyard had been influenced by the geometric work of the French landscape architect Le Notre. It was rigorously rational, in other words, and in that sense classically French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei in his Sutton Place home in Manhattan in 2008. As a boy in Shanghai, he was fascinated by the construction of a 25-story hotel. “I couldn’t resist looking into the hole,” he recalled. “That’s when I decided I wanted to build.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tony Cenicola/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What carried the day, however, was not Mr. Pei’s argument, true as it may have been, but President Mitterrand’s determination. The pyramid opened in the spring of 1989, and the elegance of the finished building, not to mention its geometric precision, won over most, if not all, of its opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Within a few years the pyramid had become an accepted, and generally admired, symbol of a re-energized Paris. And like the Kennedy Library, the John Hancock Tower and another controversial Pei project from the 1980s, the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York, it stood as a measure not just of I. M. Pei’s design talent but also of his patience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In retirement, Mr. Pei remained eager for news of both architecture and art and, until his last year, continued to make the occasional trip downtown to lunch with friends and consume his share of red Bordeaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His 100th birthday, in 2017, was marked with an elaborate black-tie dinner, given by his children, at the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, where he was toasted by many of the world’s leading architects, some of whom had begun their careers working for him, and a circle of friends that included prominent members of the Chinese community in the United States, who considered him among their most eminent figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As he blew out the candles on an enormous cake in the angular shape of the monumental Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, his last major building project, Mr. Pei beamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
