&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's at least one thing that Joe Biden and Donald Trump seem to agree on: that federal law gives unfair legal immunity to technology giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with The New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html&quot;&gt;published in January&lt;/a&gt;, Biden argued that &quot;we should be worried about&quot; Facebook &quot;being exempt&quot; from lawsuits. The Times, he noted, &quot;can’t write something you know to be false and be exempt from being sued.&quot; But under a 1996 law known as Section 230, Biden claimed, Facebook can do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Section 230 should be revoked immediately,&quot; Biden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last month, Trump expressed a similar view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, not an editor with a viewpoint,&quot; he said during an Oval Office signing ceremony for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/05/why-donald-trumps-war-on-big-tech-is-doomed-to-fail/&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; designed to rein in big technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They aren't the only politicians who feel this way, of course. Within days of the president's executive order, after Twitter applied a &quot;fact check&quot; to one of Trump's tweets, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) raised this issue in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/Hawley-Letter-Twitter-Trump-Tweets.pdf&quot;&gt;letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Twitter’s decision to editorialize regarding the content of political speech raises questions about why Twitter should continue receiving special status and special immunity from publisher liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,&quot; Hawley wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a sliver of truth to these descriptions of Section 230. The law really does give broad immunity to websites that wasn't available to anyone before the Internet. But all three comments fundamentally misrepresent how Section 230 works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden is wrong to suggest that Section 230 treats Facebook differently from The New York Times. If someone posts a defamatory comment in the comment section of a Times article, the company enjoys exactly the same legal immunity that Facebook gets for user posts. Conversely, if Facebook published a defamatory article written by an employee, it would be just as liable as the Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Trump and Hawley are wrong to suggest that Section 230 requires online platforms to be neutral. In reality, the law was written to encourage, not discourage, online platforms to filter user-submitted content. It has no requirement for neutrality—political or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while these criticisms of Section 230 miss the mark, others have raised legitimate concerns about the extraordinary breadth of Section 230. Bad actors have used Section 230 as a shield for a lot of genuinely abhorrent behavior, and a growing number of critics are calling for the law to be curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Section 230 fixed an emerging problem in the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/prodigy-login-640x480.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; alt=&quot;A login screen from Prodigy&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A login screen from Prodigy&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Section 230, you have to understand how the law worked before Congress enacted it in 1996. At the time, the market for consumer online services was dominated by three companies: Prodigy, CompuServe, and AOL. Along with access to the Internet, the companies also offered proprietary services such as realtime chats and online message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodigy distinguished itself from rivals by advertising a moderated, family-friendly experience. Employees would monitor its message boards and delete posts that didn't meet the company's standards. And this difference proved to have an immense—and rather perverse—legal consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, an anonymous user made a series of potentially defamatory statements about a securities firm called Stratton Oakmont, claiming on a Prodigy message board that a pending stock offering was fraudulent and its president was a &quot;major criminal.&quot; The company sued Prodigy for defamation in New York state court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodigy argued that it shouldn't be liable for user content. To support that view, the company pointed back to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/776/135/2340509/&quot;&gt;1991 ruling&lt;/a&gt; that shielded CompuServe from liability for a potentially defamatory article. The judge in that case analogized CompuServe to a bookstore. The courts had long held that a bookstore isn't liable for the contents of a book it sells—under defamation, obscenity, or other laws—if it isn't aware of the book's contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/4540&quot;&gt;1995 ruling&lt;/a&gt; in the Prodigy case, Judge Stuart Ain refused to apply that rule to Prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Prodigy held itself out as an online service that exercised editorial control over the content of messages posted on its computer bulletin boards, thereby expressly differentiating itself from its competition and expressly likening itself to a newspaper,&quot; Ain wrote. Unlike bookstores, newspapers exercise editorial control and can be sued any time they print defamatory content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CompuServe and Prodigy decisions each made some sense in isolation. But taken together, they had a perverse result: the more effort a service made to remove objectionable content, the more likely it was to be liable for content that slipped through the cracks. If these precedents had remained the law of the land, website owners would have had a powerful incentive not to moderate their services at all. If they tried to filter out defamation, hate speech, pornography, or other objectionable content, they would have increased their legal exposure for illegal content they didn't take down.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Abundance of Silicon Valley</title>
<link>https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/10/15/abundance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/10/15/abundance/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a trick to digging wet sand with your hands. When you first touch it, it feels as solid as concrete, and you can grind down your fingernails scrabbling away and making little progress. The trick is to wait for a wave. When a wave comes, even a long slow gentle one, buoyancy and turbulence dissolve the surface of the sand out from under you. The particles become momentarily weightless. In this transitional state, with the sand and water indistinguishable, your hands and feet can sink deep with just a gentle pressure. A few moments after the waves recede the granules lock, each irregular bump finding an irregular groove to partner with, and, mortared together by the hydrogen bonds of water and salt, they return to concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clams know this. A clam caught on the surface will wait, inert, until the tumbling and streaming of water triggers some instinct, and then with their hydrofoil shells angled into the receding wave, they extend their muscular tongues. It is tempting to call it digging, but this isn’t what it most closely resembles. It is like climbing a rope. The suspended sand slurry offers little traction or support, so the clams ratchet themselves deeper, tongue by shell, as a climber on a floppy rope does with arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Pismo beach, when you sink your hands into the sand in this way, you’ll invariably bump into a handful of Pismo clams. In every single square foot of the plain of the intertidal zone, you’ll find at least a dozen. When you find so many clams in every place you check, and then look up from your small catch to the extent of the beach, your brain cannot fathom the multiplication. It is a feeling like watching a single star out of the multitudes in the sky and seeing an exoplanet dim it as it transits, or hearing a gravitational wave after just a few weeks of being able to listen for them. The spoils themselves seem inconsequential, but their implications for the scale of the vast unseen world around you boggle the imagination. There are just too many to believe. If they were not hidden under a few inches of sand, they would cover it like cobbles on a creekbed. Pismo clams range all up the southern half of the Pacific Coast of North America, from Baja to Halfmoon bay, but more than half of the entire population of the species is found at Pismo Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs near the beach say “CLAMMING IS ILLEGAL UNLESS … MINIMUM 4 1/2″ DIAMETER SIZE,” and you will not find any clams that large on the beach. Whether by accumulated selection or just from having been picked clean, they no longer fly that close to the sun. Pismo clams were a mainstay in the diet of California’s native peoples. They were fished commercially, taken by locals, and by tourists, until by the 1980s they were gone. It is hard to imagine, looking at the beach today, that it was ever empty, and that through management of the fishery alone they have so bountifully returned. But that is perhaps the most important thing to understand about abundance. It is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;150 miles north of Pismo Beach is Moss Landing. It too is a huge beach, with a wide, flat intertidal region. It too is nestled into a graceful arc of coastline. But it has few Pismo clams. You will find a few prodigal sons, once every two dozen handfuls, but nothing like their abundance just a little farther south. Instead, it is saturated with mole crabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mole crabs live a life much like clams, fishing for debris among the waves, but they are completely opposite in temperament. The mole crabs have no instinct to bide their time and conserve their energy. From the moment they’re exposed to the air, they frantically dig with their hind legs if the surface they’re on resembles wet sand even as little as a human palm wet with seawater. The efficiency of their shovel-like legs is incredible. Elon Musk could not design a finer boring machine. When you drop them on the sand, they right themselves like roly-polies and rebury themselves in a blink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stand in the waves where the water pulls the sand under your feet, you’ll feel them moving out from under you. There are dozens in every little patch. After catching a few, you’ll notice they come in two sizes, the scurriers and the bumblers. The small ones that slip through your fingers are the males. The large ones that can’t help but be caught, and will sit in your hand embarrassed to be exposed are the matronly females, which you can confirm from the orange eggs packed among their leg joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Pismo Beach so saturated with clams, but not Moss Landing? Why is Moss Landing so saturated with mole crabs, but not Pismo Beach? Why do the clams return to Pismo Beach but not elsewhere, even after being decimated down to nothing, over and over again? Nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a matter of temperature, that Moss Landing is just slightly out of the region where they’re most comfortable. Maybe the deep ocean currents happen to bring their favorite microbiota food there. Maybe, when the clams entrust their trillions of eggs to float free in the ocean, that some accident of current happens to always return them there. There are places on the beach, where the waves are just a little different, where their resonance with the coast takes a slightly different pattern, and the physics of the waves changes. They start bringing larger denser objects farther up the beach. These accidents of current and geometry are key spots for beachcombing, and you’ll find wonderful shells in those places. Maybe some similar accident of current and ocean geometry is responsible for the clams always ending up on Pismo Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nobody knows. Nature has created a clam heaven, and no one knows how. It is unique in the world, and we couldn’t begin to understand how to recreate it, because we don’t understand how it exists. This is the second most important thing to understand about abundance. It is almost always an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every fall, in Sitka sound, the herring spawn. They turn the water milky white with sperm, and coat the rocky beaches with eggs three layers thick. The Tlingit people have a custom of dipping a hemlock bough into the water, letting the herring cover it with eggs, and then eating the eggs fresh off the branches. Ten years ago, the shoals would fill the fishing nets in such numbers that if they sounded in unison it would capsize the boats. The humpbacks would come to the sound by the hundreds to gobble them up with great churning maws. When the bald eagles rested from their gluttony they would fill every tree and roof, their white heads dusting them like Christmas popcorn garlands. But abundance is fragile. This year there will be no herring harvest in Sitka sound, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecordovatimes.com/2020/03/10/sitka-sound-herring-fishery-unlikely-in-2020/&quot;&gt;the herring are all too young and too small to sell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you witness true abundance, it seems insane. It is incredible in the original sense of the word. It is not constrained by needing to seem possible. It is something that can’t be, and yet is. It is a wave that never crests. It is a wild YOLO war whoop made flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of silicon valley, people from all over the world, gathered by currents of ambition and network effects, brought to the bay area, and stacked into decrepit victorians like clams on a beach, I see the same phenomena at work. For all its myriad faults, its crushing rents and commutes, the gradual exodus and suffering of its working class, the core of silicon valley is an exuberant abundance unmatched in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did Fairchild have to choose its epicenter as a one dimensional strip of land between mountains and bay with nowhere to physically expand to? Why did every starry-eyed post-bubble founder plop their headquarters in a dinky suburb that would fight them for office space and housing forever after? Abundance is an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political forces that would preserve the bay area’s structures in amber, even as its people decamp, cry that this growth isn’t natural. They insist that these people should move somewhere else, that the bay is full, and was just fine as it was, that tech companies should go do the work of revitalizing all the rust belt towns that their employees escaped. But it is not in the nature of life to be spread evenly over the world like smooth peanut butter. That is the nature of death, literal heat death, where everything is the same and nothing can change. We have such a meager window into such an immiserated natural world, that we don’t realize how deeply natural this is. The most intransigent cause of a lack of imagination is, after all, a lack of referrents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, we think that this cannot possibly continue, and every year it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now. As covid and wildfire smoke have atomized us all into whatever living space we can afford, and into a grid of separate video boxes on a screen, the place as it was no longer exists. The forces that kept people here are temporarily gone. Through cratering rents San Francisco is finally proving to opponents of growth that supply and demand apply to housing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I consider my own possible exit from the bay, the rent I can’t justify paying for the commute I no longer have to plan around, I think about how we should remember silicon valley if this is in fact the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abundance is fragile, it is accidental, and it is the most incredible thing on earth. If the valley must die, then let it be remembered for the force of nature it was. And maybe, like the clams always coming home, it will someday live again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hum to Search Song</title>
<link>https://blog.google/products/search/hum-to-search</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.google/products/search/hum-to-search</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;How machines learn melodies &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? An easy way to explain it is that a song’s melody is like its fingerprint: They each have their own unique identity. We've built machine learning models that can match your hum, whistle or singing to the right “fingerprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hum a melody into Search, our machine learning models transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song’s melody. Our models are trained to identify songs based on a variety of sources, including humans singing, whistling or humming, as well as studio recordings. The algorithms also take away all the other details, like accompanying instruments and the voice's timbre and tone. What we’re left with is the song’s number-based sequence, or the fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compare these sequences to thousands of songs from around the world and identify potential  matches in real time. For example, if you listen to Tones and I’s “Dance Monkey,” you’ll recognize the song whether it was sung, whistled, or hummed. Similarly, our machine learning models recognize the melody of the studio-recorded version of the song, which we can use to match it with a person’s hummed audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds on the work of our AI Research team’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html&quot;&gt;music recognition technology&lt;/a&gt;. We launched Now Playing on the Pixel 2 in 2017, using deep neural networks to bring low-power recognition of music to mobile devices. In 2018, we brought the same technology to the SoundSearch feature in the Google app and expanded the reach to a catalog of millions of songs. This new experience takes it a step further, because now we can recognize songs without the lyrics or original song. All we need is a hum.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What if a pill can change your politics or religious beliefs?</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-if-a-pill-can-change-your-politics-or-religious-beliefs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-if-a-pill-can-change-your-politics-or-religious-beliefs/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you feel about a new therapy for your chronic pain, which—although far more effective than any available alternative—might also change your religious beliefs? Or a treatment for lymphoma that brings one in three patients into remission, but also made them more likely to vote for your least preferred political party?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem like idle hypothetical questions about impossible side effects. After all, this is not how medicine works. But a new mental health treatment, set to be licensed next year, poses just this sort of problem. Psychotherapy assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic compound in “magic mushrooms,” seems to be remarkably effective in treating a wide range of psychopathologies, but also causes a raft of unusual nonclinical changes not seen elsewhere in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although its precise therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, clinically relevant doses of psilocybin can induce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2006/griffithspsilocybin.pdf&quot;&gt;powerful mystical experiences&lt;/a&gt; more commonly associated with extended periods of fasting, prayer or meditation. Arguably, then, it is unsurprising that it can generate long-lasting changes in patients: studies report increased prosociality and aesthetic appreciation, plus robust shifts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3537171/&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881110382466&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308357/&quot;&gt;attitudes to life&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214377&quot;&gt;leading some atheists to find God&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, these experiences appear to be a feature, rather than a bug, of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/&quot;&gt;intensity of the mystical experience correlating with the extent of clinical benefit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are undoubtedly interesting findings, but should any of it matter? However unusual a treatment’s consequences, shouldn’t we prioritize the preferences of an informed, consenting patient? &lt;em&gt;Yes, I understand that this might change me in strange ways. But my depression is debilitating. I will roll that dice.&lt;/em&gt; Putting aside the matter of how well-informed one could really be about such radical transformations, political realities make things more complicated, with the case of psilocybin— currently a Schedule 1, highly illicit drug—showing vividly how values, politics and social narratives can influence the development of biomedical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taboo of the illicit is not an insuperable obstacle. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), an organization that advocates for “careful uses” of psychedelics, has gone an impressive way in rehabilitating MDMA (i.e., ecstasy) into a legitimate medicine. MAPS’s masterstroke was to focus on demonstrating its potential for treating PTSD. By articulating how MDMA-assisted therapy could help veterans, support for whom enjoys a rare level of bipartisan agreement, MAPS have attracted supporters from across the political spectrum, receiving positive coverage from MSNBC and Fox News alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of psilocybin-assisted therapy tout it as the solution to the burgeoning mental health crisis. But, like MDMA, psilocybin is far from a culturally neutral drug, carrying both the shame of Schedule 1 status and a checkered social history. It too may need to build the kind of politically heterogeneous coalition of supporters that MDMA-assisted therapy enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to generate a breadth of appeal, one challenge stands out: psilocybin seems to make people more liberal. Scientific reports associating psychedelic use and liberal values stretch back as far as 1971, and although these findings have been replicated more recently, a noncausal explanation is readily available. Those with conservative attitudes tend to look more disapprovingly on illicit drug use, making them less likely than liberals to try a psychedelic drug in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, emerging evidence suggests the relationship could be causal, with clinically administered psilocybin actively shifting political values, just as it shifts many other nonclinical characteristics. Notably, one study of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression reported that the treatment &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117748902&quot;&gt;decreased authoritarian political views in patients&lt;/a&gt;. That clinical trial also detected another effect that had previously been reported in healthy participants: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3537171/&quot;&gt;psilocybin use leads to increases in the personality domain of openness&lt;/a&gt;, itself a predictor of liberal values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If psilocybin does change political values, the significance of this effect goes deeper than which politicians or media outlets will seek to support or impede psilocybin-assisted therapy. A well-established consensus on the secular democratic state is that it should remain neutral and agnostic on a number of matters, allowing a diversity of values, political attitudes and religious beliefs among its citizens. Where such states have universal health care systems, is it permissible to not only endorse, but fund through taxpayer contributions, a treatment which shifts values in one direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sample sizes currently small, more research is needed to understand whether there truly is a causal relationship at work, and, if so, what its nature might be. Perhaps psilocybin doesn’t so much induce liberal values, but rather consolidates whatever values were present before treatment. A health care modality that entrenches preexisting political sentiments is, at the least, unlikely to make enemies. The same could not be said of a treatment that shifts patients in one direction along the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this obstacle, advocates of psilocybin-assisted therapy need an inspiring banner that members of any political tribe could rally around. With few things that unite us as powerfully as politics can divide us, perhaps the most alluring banner will be the one thing that unites us all: death. While psilocybin is neither a cure for, nor a prophylactic against, death, studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210962&quot;&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27909164/&quot;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that it could play a profound role in the future of palliative care. The existential distress experienced when faced with a life-threatening or terminal illness can steal away what little quality of life remains for the dying. Such distress responds poorly to our standard pharmaceutical approaches, but the powerful mystical experiences induced by psilocybin consistently transmute demoralization, anxiety and depression into acceptance, peacefulness and meaning, as patients prepare to meet their death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However else they differ, conservatives and liberals are united in knowing that they, and their loved ones, will eventually die. And for conservatives and liberals alike, psilocybin could help them welcome the end with greater acceptance and less fear. Psilocybin looks set to become a licensed medicine by 2022. But how many ultimately benefit from it will be a matter not just of how well it works, but also the narrative surrounding it when it arrives: does psilocybin underline how we are different, or how we are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hacked billboards make Teslas see phantom objects causing them to swerve or stop</title>
<link>https://www.newsweek.com/hacked-billboards-can-make-teslas-see-phantom-objects-1539478</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newsweek.com/hacked-billboards-can-make-teslas-see-phantom-objects-1539478</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have demonstrated how Tesla's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/topic/autopilot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; driver-assistance systems can be tricked into changing speed, swerving or stopping abruptly, simply by projecting fake road signs or virtual objects in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their hacks worked on both a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tesla&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; running HW3, which is the latest version of the company's Autopilot driver-assistance system, and the previous generation, HW2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most concerning finding is that a fake road sign only needs to be displayed for less than half a second, in order to trigger a response from Tesla's system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one example cited by the researchers, a &quot;Stop&quot; sign hidden within a fast food commercial successfully caused a Tesla running in Autopilot mode to stop, despite the command only flashing on-screen for a fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system also recognized virtual projections of people and cars as real objects, responding by slowing down the car in order to avoid colliding with them, and was tricked by a drone that projected a fake speed sign onto a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, said their findings &quot;reflect a fundamental flaw of models that detect objects [but] were not trained to distinguish between real and fake objects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to imagine how a bad actor could use the shortcoming to cause an accident or traffic jam, by hacking into a digital billboard for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such attacks have to potential to be both dangerous and easy to carry out because they &quot;can be applied remotely (using a drone equipped with a portable projector or by hacking digital billboards that face the Internet and are located close to roads), thereby eliminating the need to physically approach the attack scene, changing the exposure vs. application balance,&quot; the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're also so fleeting that they're difficult for the human eye to detect, and leave behind very little evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;innerBox&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;mapping-embed lazysize lazyload imgPhoto&quot; id=&quot;i1653142&quot; data-src=&quot;https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1653142/tesla-model-x-electric-car-dashboard.jpg?w=790&amp;amp;f=c96918cd377cdb11b18487cba51e7725&quot; alt=&quot;tesla model x electric car dashboard&quot; title=&quot;tesla model x electric car dashboard&quot; width=&quot;790&quot; height=&quot;527&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;The interior of a Tesla Model X full electric luxury crossover SUV car with a large touch screen and carbon look dashboard on display at Brussels Expo on January 9, in Brussels, Belgium. Researchers have found that the vision-based Autopilot mode favored by Tesla can be tricked by projections and fake billboards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar hacks also worked on the Mobileye 630 Autopilot system, because both it and Tesla's system rely on visual recognition through the use of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed that these attacks would not have fooled autopilot systems that rely on LIDAR, which measures distances and maps surroundings with the use of lasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, however, has been consistently critical of LIDAR, which is a more expensive system, famously proclaiming in 2019 that: &quot;Lidar is a fool's errand. Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla, which insists that Autopilot requires &quot;active driver supervision and [does] not make the vehicle autonomous,&quot; has been informed of the findings by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Hacked billboards can make Teslas see &quot;phantom objects,&quot; causing them to swerve or stop abruptly</og:title>
<og:description>Tesla's Autopilot system relies on vision rather than LIDAR, which means it can be tricked by messages on billboards and projections created by hackers.</og:description>

<title>Is Stupidity Expanding? Some Hypotheses</title>
<link>https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BHqzGLNyQHjDXhEc8/is-stupidity-expanding-some-hypotheses</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BHqzGLNyQHjDXhEc8/is-stupidity-expanding-some-hypotheses</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;To be ex­plained: &lt;strong&gt;It feels to me that in re­cent years, peo­ple have got­ten stupi­der, or that stupid has got­ten big­ger, or that the parts of peo­ple that were always stupid have got­ten louder, or some­thing like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come up with a suite of hy­pothe­ses to ex­plain this (with a lit­tle help from my friends). I thought I’d throw them out here to see which ones the wise crowd here think are most likely. Bonus points if you come up with some new ones. Gold stars if you can rule some out based on ex­ist­ing data or can pro­pose tests by which they might be ren­dered more or less plau­si­ble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hy­pothe­ses come in two broad fam­i­lies: 1) my feel­ing that stupid is ex­pand­ing is an illu­sion or mis­per­cep­tion, and 2) stupid is ex­pand­ing and here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol readability=&quot;35.316170957261&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1.6588235294118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have be­come more at­tuned to stu­pidity for [rea­sons], so even though there is no more of it than usual, it stands out more to me. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion&quot;&gt;Baader-Mein­hof phe­nomenon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What used to look like non-stu­pidity was ac­tu­ally wide­spread con­for­mity to a com­mon menu of fool­ish­nesses. To­day the cul­tural bea­cons of re­spectable idiocy have been over­thrown and there is in­creas­ing di­ver­sity in fool­ish­ness. Diver­gent fools seem more fool­ish to each other when in fact we’re all just as stupid as we’ve always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m run­ning in stupi­der cir­cles than I used to for some rea­son, while in gen­eral things haven’t changed much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.6794425087108&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the one get­ting stupi­der, or was stupid all along, and so I don’t have the cog­ni­tive strength to ac­cu­rately judge the stu­pidity level around me, and just hap­pen to be think­ing it is get­ting worse be­cause I don’t know any bet­ter. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dun­ning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple aren’t get­ting any stupi­der, it’s just that the ar­tifi­cial in­tel­li­gence of the bots I’m mis­tak­ing for peo­ple on-line isn’t all that good yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not get­ting stupi­der; I’m just get­ting more con­ceited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple or­di­nar­ily use differ­ent modes of think­ing in differ­ent com­mu­ni­ca­tions con­texts. In some, find­ing the truth is im­por­tant and so they use ra­tio­nal in­tel­li­gence. In oth­ers, dec­o­ra­tive dis­play, rit­ual, as­sert­ing dom­i­nance or sub­mis­sion, dis­play­ing tribal alle­giances, etc. are more im­por­tant and so they use modes more ap­pro­pri­ate to those things. It’s not that peo­ple are get­ting stupi­der, but that these non-in­tel­li­gent forms of com­mu­ni­ca­tion (a) are more am­plified than they used to be, (b) more com­monly prac­ticed than they used to be, or (c) are more promi­nent where I hap­pen to be train­ing my at­ten­tion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ac­quiring greater wis­dom with age as I ought, but the av­er­age age of the typ­i­cal per­son I en­counter stays the same so they can­not keep up. I’m notic­ing the con­trast in­creas­ing but mis­at­tribut­ing it. (David Wood­er­son effect)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple use in­tel­li­gence for differ­ent things in differ­ent eras. Just as lan­guage, mu­sic, art changes over time, so does think­ing. I’m just not keep­ing up, and as­sum­ing be­cause kids these days can’t dance the men­tal Charleston that they can’t dance at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.78378378378378&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were just as stupid back in the day, and I just don’t re­mem­ber it that way. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection&quot;&gt;Rosy ret­ro­spec­tion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no truth, only power. What I’ve been in­ter­pret­ing as truth and ra­tio­nal­ity has been my own at­tempt to al­ign my think­ing with the poli­ti­cal clique that was in power when I was be­ing ed­u­cated. What I’m in­ter­pret­ing as ris­ing stu­pidity has been the col­lapse in power and sta­tus of that clique and the poli­ti­cal ob­so­les­cence of the va­ri­ety of “truth” and “ra­tio­nal­ity” I in­ter­nal­ized as a child. Those pomo philoso­phers were right all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stu­pidity doesn’t have stay­ing power, rel­a­tive to non-stu­pidity: there’s a sort of sur­vival of the fittest in which vast amounts of ex­pres­sions are be­ing pro­duced all the time, most of which are stupid and fall away, but the ones that aren’t stupid are more likely to sur­vive in mem­ory and to be main­tained in the his­tor­i­cal record. This bi­ases things to make it ap­pear that the pro­por­tion of non-stupid ex­pres­sions was lower in the past than it re­ally was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poli­tics and con­sumer cap­i­tal­ism are mo­ti­vated to iden­tify and tar­get stupid peo­ple so as to take ad­van­tage of them, so they have cre­ated sys­tems that en­courage stupid peo­ple to self-iden­tify and make them­selves promi­nent so that they can be picked off; that I’m notic­ing this is just a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peo­ple have given up try­ing to un­der­stand things in this messed-up timeline and are just rol­ling with it; it’s a sort of in­tel­lec­tual learned hel­pless­ness that ap­pears as ex­pand­ing stu­pidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stu­pidity has its fash­ions, and the lat­est fash­ions are more in-your-face than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals that have be­come pop­u­lar in re­cent decades have cog­ni­tive side effects that are difficult to mea­sure in the in­di­vi­d­ual but cause no­tice­able effects in the ag­gre­gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly some­thing in our diet, for ex­am­ple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly all that ex­tra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the at­mo­sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly tox­o­plas­mo­sis meow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s real, and it’s prob­a­bly some other sort of change in our ma­te­rial en­vi­ron­ment (ex­clud­ing cul­tural changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, when a per­son had a stupid idea, they would be re­luc­tant to put it for­ward as their own. Rather, they would wait to see if some­one else would voice the idea so they could just agree with it. This used to be rel­a­tively rare, but now you just have to google “[my stupid idea]” to find that some­one or other has said it first, and then you’re off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a smart idea, you may also be smart enough to re­al­ize that it’s not use­ful right now /​ has already been bet­ter said /​ is in­ap­pro­pri­ate in con­text. If you have a dumb idea, such thoughts may be less likely to oc­cur to you due to the aura of dumbth that sur­rounds the dumb idea and re­pels sen­si­ble con­sid­er­a­tions. Back when ex­pres­sions of stu­pidity were mostly ephemeral, this didn’t mat­ter much, but now that they ac­quire in­stant per­ma­nence and global reach, they ap­pear to swamp ev­ery­thing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid choices used to re­li­ably have un­de­sir­able re­sults; now there is more of a dis­con­nect where peo­ple are shielded from the re­sults of their stupid choices, or even re­warded for them (man lights him­self on fire in an eas­ily-forsee­able mis­ad­ven­ture, be­comes YouTube leg­end). So peo­ple may be ap­pear­ing stupid not as a re­sult of be­ing stupid but as the re­sult of a per­verse cost-benefit anal­y­sis. Peo­ple are no dumber than they used to be, but for [rea­sons] it has be­come ad­van­ta­geous to dis­play stu­pidity and so smart peo­ple some­times mimic idiocy so as to reap such ad­van­tages. The smarter they are, the quicker they caught on to this and the bet­ter mimics they are, so this makes it look as though the smart peo­ple are be­ing re­placed by mo­rons, when re­ally it’s more a mat­ter of cam­ou­flage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we ed­u­cate chil­dren went se­ri­ously side­ways a while back, and so, yeah, stupid hap­pened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly-pop­u­lar me­dia and/​or its con­tent is some­how di­rectly dam­ag­ing to men­tal fac­ul­ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in me­dia/​com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy al­low stupid peo­ple to be much more promi­nent than they used to be and/​or com­par­a­tively muffle smarter peo­ple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So­cial me­dia dy­nam­ics erode rea­son­ing and truth-seek­ing while re­ward­ing cog­ni­tive bi­ases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news me­dia were do­ing a bet­ter job than we re­al­ized in fil­ter­ing out crap and con­tex­tu­al­iz­ing new in­for­ma­tion in­tel­li­gently for us, and as the in­ter­net de­stroyed the busi­ness model be­hind in­tel­li­gent re­port­ing, we failed to come up with a sub­sti­tute in time to pre­vent idiocy from filling the void and it’s too big a job for in­di­vi­d­u­als to do with­out in­sti­tu­tional as­sis­tance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
