<title>A new weapon in arbitration: sheer volume</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Teel Lidow couldn’t quite believe the numbers. Over the past few years, the nation’s largest telecom companies, like Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T, have had a combined 330 million customers. Yet annually an average of just 30 people took the companies to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt;, the forum where millions of Americans are forced to hash out &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/business/dealbook/in-arbitration-a-privatization-of-the-justice-system.html?searchResultPosition=7&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;legal disputes with corporations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lidow, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a law degree, figured there had to be more people upset with their cable companies. He was right. Within a few months, Mr. Lidow found more than 1,000 people interested in filing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/business/dealbook/in-religious-arbitration-scripture-is-the-rule-of-law.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt; claims against the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;About the same time last year, Travis Lenkner and his law partners at the firm Keller Lenkner had a similar realization. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/business/dealbook/start-ups-embrace-arbitration-to-settle-workplace-disputes.html?searchResultPosition=5&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Arbitration clauses&lt;/a&gt; bar employees at many companies from joining together to mount class-action lawsuits. But what would happen, the lawyers wondered, if those workers started filing tens of thousands of arbitration claims all at once? Many companies, it turns out, can’t handle the caseload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hit with about 2,250 claims in one day last summer, for example, the delivery company DoorDash was “scared to death” by the onslaught, according to internal documents unsealed in February in federal court in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Driven partly by a legal reformist spirit and entrepreneurial zeal, Mr. Lidow and Mr. Lenkner are leaders in testing a new weapon in arbitration: sheer volume. And as companies face a flood of claims, they are employing new strategies to thwart the very process that they have upheld as the optimal way to resolve disputes. Companies, in a few instances, have refused to pay the fees required to start the arbitration process, hoping that would short-circuit the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There is no way that the system can handle mass arbitrations,” said Cliff Palefsky, a San Francisco employment lawyer who has worked to develop fairness standards for arbitration. “The companies are trying to weasel their way out of the system that they created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even as Supreme Court rulings over the last two decades have enshrined arbitration as the primary way that companies can hash out disputes, giving them enormous sway, consumer advocates and labor rights groups have criticized its inequities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One of the biggest obstacles for consumers and workers is that payouts on individual arbitration judgments don’t justify the costs of mounting a complex case against a big company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some of the mass arbitration strategies may be changing that calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lidow runs FairShake, a start-up that uses an automated system to get the arbitration process started. If the claim results in a payout, the start-up takes a cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lidow got interested in arbitration after the e-commerce company he founded to sell ethically sourced clothing shut down. A former mergers and acquisitions lawyer, he wanted to use some of his digital know-how to disrupt the cumbersome, clubby legal system that nearly every American must agree to use instead of going to court against their employer, rental car provider or cable company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the spring of 2018, FairShake bought targeted Google ads that invited anyone with gripes against a cable and internet company to start the arbitration process through its website. Over two months, FairShake notified companies like AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast that it was filing 1,000 arbitration claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The companies were caught off guard. It took six months for many of the claims to move through arbitration. And some were still making their way through the system two years later. To Mr. Lidow, that seemed like a long time for two of the nation’s largest companies, with ample legal resources, that have vouched publicly for the efficiencies of arbitration over court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was particularly notable because AT&amp;amp;T was at the center of a landmark 2011 Supreme Court ruling that anointed arbitration as a fair forum for legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“From our perspective, the companies weren’t prepared to administratively handle that volume,” Mr. Lidow said. “The whole system wasn’t prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An AT&amp;amp;T spokesman said FairShake’s “system is unnecessary because our process is so easy to follow and efficient for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;FairShake is expanding its focus to other industries, like consumer finance and home security. For the arbitration claims that FairShake has settled, consumers have gotten an average payout of $700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lenkner and his colleagues at Keller Lenkner, which is based in Chicago, also see a potentially viable legal niche in mass arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A former lawyer at Boeing who clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, Mr. Lenkner said most companies never expected that people would actually use arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The conventional wisdom might say that arbitration is a bad development for plaintiffs and an automatic win for the companies,” he said. “We don’t see it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Keller Lenkner’s first wave of cases have focused on workers in the gig economy. Many of these workers, particularly at food delivery companies, have been thrust onto the front line of the coronavirus crisis by ferrying food and supplies to housebound consumers, while risking getting sick. A large number of their employers require these workers to sign arbitration clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lenkner said he believed that his firm could economically mount arbitration claims, one by one, because the gig workers had similar allegations against companies like Uber and Postmates — namely that they have been misclassified as independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One of the firm’s latest showdowns is with DoorDash, a leading food delivery app in the United States. It shows the traction that mass arbitration is gaining with judges and the lengths that companies will go trying to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It began last summer when Keller Lenkner filed more than 6,000 arbitration claims on behalf of couriers for DoorDash, known as “dashers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among them was Victoria Diltz, a single mother in the Bay Area who works at a fast-food restaurant and as a housekeeper, and relies on making deliveries for DoorDash to generate extra cash for a tank of gas, groceries or car payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She said the company’s formula for paying workers was inconsistent, but as an independent contractor she had no way to challenge that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They know we are desperate for the cash, so we will do whatever,” said Ms. Diltz, 46, who lived out of her car for a period while working for DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The cases were taken to the American Arbitration Association, an entity that provides the judges and sets up the hearings for such disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;DoorDash specified in its contracts with its roughly 700,000 dashers that they had to use the association when filing an arbitration claim. The company also told the dashers that it would pay any fees that the association required to start the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then DoorDash got the bill for the 6,000 claims — more than $9 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;DoorDash balked, arguing in court that it couldn’t be sure that all of the claimants were legitimate dashers. The American Arbitration Association said the company had to pay anyway. It refused, and the claims were essentially dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company made other moves seeking to limit the damage from mass arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;DoorDash’s lawyers at the Gibson Dunn firm reached out to another arbitration provider, which turned out to be more accommodating on some issues important to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The International Institute for Conflict Prevention &amp;amp; Resolution, or C.P.R., was willing to allow DoorDash to arbitrate “test cases” and avoid having to pay the fees all at once. C.P.R. also took feedback from Gibson Dunn on the proposed new rules, though it did not consult with the dashers’ lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement, C.P.R. said the new rules for mass arbitration were broad based and not specific to the DoorDash case. It also said the new rules had provisions that were generally favorable to plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If they wanted to keep “dashing” for DoorDash, workers had to sign a new contract designating C.P.R. as the new arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But a federal judge in San Francisco wasn’t willing to go along with it. The judge, William Alsup, ordered DoorDash in February to proceed with the American Arbitration Association cases and pay the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement, a spokeswoman for DoorDash said the company “believes that arbitration is an efficient and fair way to resolve disputes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But in a hearing, Judge Alsup questioned whether the company and its lawyers really believed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Your law firm and all the defense law firms have tried for 30 years to keep plaintiffs out of court,” the judge told lawyers for Gibson Dunn late last year. “And so finally someone says, ‘OK, we’ll take you to arbitration,’ and suddenly it’s not in your interest anymore. Now you’re wiggling around, trying to find some way to squirm out of your agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There is a lot of poetic justice here,” the judge added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The same cookbook on Amazon is currently delayed until late April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massive order volume, fueled by the global coronavirus crisis, is causing a logistics backlog at Amazon.

<title>Mysterious heart damage, not just lung troubles, befalling Covid-19 patients</title>
<link>https://khn.org/news/mysterious-heart-damage-not-just-lung-troubles-befalling-covid-19-patients/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://khn.org/news/mysterious-heart-damage-not-just-lung-troubles-befalling-covid-19-patients/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related partner-box top&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the focus of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on respiratory problems and securing enough ventilators, doctors on the front lines are grappling with a new medical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to lung damage, many COVID-19 patients are also developing heart problems — and dying of cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more data comes in from China and Italy, as well as Washington state and New York, more cardiac experts are coming to believe the COVID-19 virus can infect the heart muscle. An initial study found cardiac damage in as many as 1 in 5 patients, leading to heart failure and death even among those who show no signs of respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could change the way doctors and hospitals need to think about patients, particularly in the early stages of illness. It also could open up a second front in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, with a need for new precautions in people with preexisting heart problems, new demands for equipment and, ultimately, new treatment plans for damaged hearts among those who survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;slab email-slab&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;slab-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to KHN’s free Morning Briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s extremely important to answer the question: Is their heart being affected by the virus and can we do something about it?” said Dr.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montefiore.org/body_mobile.cfm?id=1743&amp;amp;action=detail&amp;amp;ref=5638&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ulrich Jorde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the head of heart failure, cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support for the Montefiore Health System in New York City. “This may save many lives in the end.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virus Or Illness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether the emerging heart problems are caused by the virus itself or are a byproduct of the body’s reaction to it has become one of the critical unknowns facing doctors as they race to understand the novel illness. Determining how the virus affects the heart is difficult, in part, because severe illness alone can influence heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone who’s dying from a bad pneumonia will ultimately die because the heart stops,” said Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=14435&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Robert Bonow&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cardiology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and editor of the medical journal JAMA Cardiology. “You can’t get enough oxygen into your system and things go haywire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bonow and many other cardiac specialists believe a COVID-19 infection could lead to damage to the heart in four or five ways. Some patients, they say, might be affected by more than one of those pathways at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that any serious medical event, even something as straightforward as hip surgery, can create enough stress to damage the heart. Moreover, a condition like pneumonia can cause widespread inflammation in the body. That, in turn, can lead to plaque in arteries becoming unstable, causing heart attacks. Inflammation can also cause a condition known as myocarditis, which can lead to the weakening of the heart muscle and, ultimately, heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bonow said the damage observed in COVID-19 patients could be from the virus directly infecting the heart muscle. Initial research suggests the coronavirus attaches to certain receptors in the lungs, and those same receptors are found in heart muscle as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Data From China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, doctors from China published two studies that gave the first glimpse at how prevalent cardiac problems were among patients with COVID-19 illness. The larger of the two studies looked at 416 hospitalized patients. The researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763524?resultClick=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;19% showed signs of heart damage&lt;/a&gt;. And those who did were significantly more likely to die: 51% of those with heart damage died versus 4.5% who did not have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who had heart disease before their coronavirus infections were much more likely to show heart damage afterward. But some patients with no previous heart disease also showed signs of cardiac damage. In fact, patients with no preexisting heart conditions who incurred heart damage during their infection were more likely to die than patients with previous heart disease but no COVID-19-induced cardiac damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why some patients experience more cardiac effects than others. Bonow said that could be due to a genetic predisposition or it could be because they’re exposed to higher viral loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those uncertainties underscore the need for closer monitoring of cardiac markers in COVID-19 patients, Jorde said. If doctors in New York, Washington state and other hot spots can start to tease out how the virus is affecting the heart, they may be able to provide a risk score or other guidance to help clinicians manage COVID-19 patients in other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to assume, maybe, that the virus affects the heart directly,” Jorde said. “But it’s essential to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facing Obstacles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering the data to do so amid the crisis, however, can be difficult. Ideally, doctors would take biopsies of the heart to determine whether the heart muscle is infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But COVID-19 patients are often so sick it’s difficult for them to undergo invasive procedures. And more testing could expose additional health care workers to the virus. Many hospitals aren’t using electrocardiograms on patients in isolation to avoid bringing additional staff into the room and using up limited masks or other protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyp.org/physician/saparikh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sahil Parikh&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, said hospitals are making a concerted effort to order the tests needed and to enter findings in medical records so they can sort out what’s going on with the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all recognize that because we’re at the leading edge, for better or for worse, we need to try to compile information and use it to help advance the field,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, despite the surge in patients, doctors continue to gather data, compile trends and publish their findings in near real time. Parikh and several colleagues recently penned a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/early/2020/03/18/j.jacc.2020.03.031&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;compilation&lt;/a&gt; of what’s known about cardiac complications of COVID-19, making the article available online immediately and adding new findings before the article comes out in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are sharing the latest COVID-19 information through a WhatsApp group that has at least 150 members. And even as New York hospitals are operating under crisis conditions, doctors are testing new drugs and treatments in clinical trials to ensure that what they have learned about the coronavirus can be shared elsewhere with scientific validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That work has already resulted in changes in the way hospitals deal with the cardiac implications of COVID-19. Doctors have found that the infection can mimic a heart attack. They have taken patients to the cardiac catheterization lab to clear a suspected blockage, only to find the patient wasn’t really experiencing a heart attack but had COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, hospitals have rushed suspected heart attack patients directly to the catheterization lab, bypassing the emergency room, in an effort to shorten the time from when the patient enters the door to when doctors can clear the blockage with a balloon. Door-to-balloon time had become an important measure of how well hospitals treat heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re taking a step back from that now and thinking about having patients brought to the emergency department so they can get evaluated briefly, so that we could determine: Is this somebody who’s really at high risk for COVID-19?” Parikh said. “And is this manifestation that we’re calling a heart attack really a heart attack?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New protocols now include bringing in a cardiologist and getting an EKG or an ultrasound to confirm a blockage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing that in large measure to protect the patient from what would be an otherwise unnecessary procedure,” Parikh said, “But also to help us decide which sort of level of personal protective equipment we would employ in the cath lab.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorting out how the virus affects the heart should help doctors determine which therapies to pursue to keep patients alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorde said that after COVID-19 patients recover, they could have long-term effects from such heart damage. But, he said, treatments exist for various forms of heart damage that should be effective once the viral infection has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that could require another wave of widespread health care demands after the pandemic has calmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;I'm a web developer and DevOps engineer. I know a few languages and frameworks very well, I can find my way around with a good deal of other languages and frameworks, and I'd like to learn a lot more.
&lt;p&gt;My problem is that I cannot seem to be able to pick a project (any project) and stick with it long enough to do any meaningful progress, let alone finishing it. It's been several years since I've managed to work on a side project for more than two days continually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit before the computer thinking: I know! I'll write a roguelike in X! Five minutes later, I'm thinking: fuck roguelikes! I'll write a graphical solitar card game with Y! Five minutes later, I don't care for it anymore, and would rather write an isomorphic strategy game in Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens with tools I might need, applications I think about, experimental stuff, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced this, and, more importantly, found their way out? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theia is designed in a modular way to allow extenders and adopters customizing and extending every aspect of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composing a custom IDE-like product is as easy as listing all needed extensions in a package.json file. Adding new functionality by implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/docs/authoring_extensions&quot;&gt;your own extensions&lt;/a&gt; is easy, too and provides all the flexibility you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-11bjxqr e1mmv6rn0&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;row banner&quot; readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/static/theia-logo-edited-a5310c78563e0592df22c555efd7d215.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Theia Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading-tertiary&quot;&gt;Theia versus VS Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe &lt;strong&gt;VS Code is an excellent product&lt;/strong&gt;. That is why Theia embraces many of the design decisions and even directly supports VS Code extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;The most significant differences are:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theia's architecture is more modular&lt;/strong&gt; and allows for way more customizations,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theia is &lt;strong&gt;designed from the ground to run on Desktop and Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theia is developed under a &lt;strong&gt;vendor-neutral Open-Source Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Coronavirus and Credibility</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/coronavirus-and-credibility-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;229&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Coronavirus and Credibility&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;April 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh4uS4f78o&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of TV journalists and politicians confidently saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What struck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how daring. How could they feel safe saying such things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could get caught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly and unequivocally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly didn't realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking people's measure. As Warren Buffet said, &quot;It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked.&quot; And the tide has just gone out like never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we've seen the results, let's remember what we saw, because this is the most accurate test of credibility we're ever likely to have. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>How SEO Ruined the Internet</title>
<link>https://www.superhighway98.com/seo</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.superhighway98.com/seo</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Between 1998 and 2003, searching for something on Google was magical. I remember inputting a vague notion like &quot;oil mother's milk,&quot; and being directed to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2000/07/gold/&quot;&gt;interview with Thomas Gold&lt;/a&gt;, an astrophysicist who postulated that hydrocarbon deposits refilled themselves because of geological pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, if you're looking for something that is technical, specific, academic or generally non-commercial, good frigging luck. The world's best information retrieval system has devolved into something reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informationweek.com/digg-dogged-by-allegations-of-manipulation-/d/d-id/1046783&quot;&gt;2006-era Digg&lt;/a&gt;: A popularity index that's controlled by a small number of commercially motivated players. They call themselves &quot;SEOs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technical search-engine optimization specialists get a pass: They generally make the web faster, safer and more accessible. &quot;Black hat&quot; SEOs are obvious villains. They boost their own web rankings by breaking the law (e.g. hacking into a website to add links back to their own). But, black hats are the petty criminals of the SEO world. It's the &quot;white hat&quot; SEOs, the supposed good guys, who are the wolves in sheep's clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These web marketers have a simple strategy: to squelch competition by concentrating authority. They march behind a banner of legitimacy and self righteousness, and like a totalitarian regime, they believe their end justifies their means. Here are some of the tactics they use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewriting history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you've ever re-read an article and sworn that the headline, hyperlinks and headings were modified, you're not imagining it. SEO specialists &quot;optimize&quot; old articles to make them more marketable (and to drive visitors into newer, more commercial content). When I look back at articles that I wrote a decade ago, they've been updated with text that I didn't write, carrying meanings that I didn't mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erasing the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Content pruning&quot; is an effective SEO tactic on large, established websites. Rather that archiving old content with historical significance, many websites will delete it from their servers and return a 410 status code. &lt;em&gt;Gone&lt;/em&gt;. The goal is to optimize &quot;crawl budget,&quot; keeping Google focused on the content that matters now. The result is a web without institutional memory or accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directing the narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Show me a modern newsroom and I'll show you a content strategist whom writers are expected to consult. But, when journalists feel pressured to write about topics they are not comfortable with, or, when they are compelled to phrase things in a specific way, &quot;SEO best practices&quot; start to look like propaganda. This is the &lt;em&gt;cable news effect&lt;/em&gt;, where a behind-the-scenes strategist is editing the script and pushing every trend as &quot;Breaking News!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing the illusion of choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A handful of publishing companies own hundreds media websites that collectively receive billions of search engine visits each year. Search for &quot;best smartphone&quot; and you may see results from websites like &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;T3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Top Ten Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn't matter which site you vote for with your click, the ballot is stacked: All of those websites are owned by a single company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoarding wealth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Links are the currency of the web. Without them, search engines couldn't judge the relative worth of one page versus another. Unfortunately, many large websites hoard their link equity by refusing to link to external websites, or, by using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html&quot;&gt;rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; attribute&lt;/a&gt; on every external link (i.e. telling search engines to ignore those links). This makes the entire web poorer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;SEO is a zero-sum game that has a loser for every winner. But, we all lose when SEO promotes gaslighting, link rot, conformity, monopoly and subversion. I remember when it was easy to find logic, facts, and reason on the web. Then, someone optimized it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IKEA Frekvens LED box hack</title>
<link>http://spritesmods.com/?art=frekvens</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://spritesmods.com/?art=frekvens</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/frekvens/frekvens-box.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikea is an interesting store. Even if you go in having in mind you're only going to buy that one thing that you actually need and this time you're not going to be distracted by other crap, you tend to come out with about three times the amount of things you wanted to buy. For us hackers, especially Ikea-fare equipped with a power cord or batteries has this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most recent time this struck was when I was back in the Netherlands. I was there on a planned visit, intending to only stay a few weeks. However, this was in the beginning of 2020 and the entire COVID-19 debacle was just beginning... I was about to be away from my lab for a fair longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/news/frekvens-limited-collection-pubcd6f39e0&quot;&gt;Frekvens&lt;/a&gt; range of electronics at Ikea, I couldn't help myself and bought one of them. For those not in the know: The Ikea Frekvens range of things is intended to be the modern equivalent of the old-school 'HiFi' set plus the ubiquitous set of hexagonal disco light half the teenagers seemed to own during the '90s. In this case, the range of inter-connectable devices consists of a Bluetooth speaker for audio output and a LED spot (extendable with multiple covers) to flash to the beat, as well as a LED display cube that can display animations that move to the beat as well. Ikea boasts that the range is developed in cooperation with Teenage Engineering, known for their Pocket Operator set of portable 'toy' synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/frekvens/party.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As illustrated on Ikea's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUwALQZ2mY&quot;&gt;promotional video&lt;/a&gt;, the end result of buying a few dozen of them would be an obnoxious blink-fest, something my inner 15-year old would not mind having in his room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the LED display cube interested me: it was a nicely integrated box running directly off of mains power. On the front, it had a matrix of 16 rows and 16 columns of very bright white LEDs, making for a total of 256 LEDs. The animations that were built in to the box were somewhat simple but they did lead me to believe the hardware could actually control each LED individually. The downside is that the little box was a bit on the pricey side: it set me back EUR40 or so. For that, you get the box with the LEDs and a power cord. As they assume you buy this thing in combination with other products in the Frekvens line, you also get some stuff to hook it up to that: a power extension cord to 'loop through' the mains to other boxes, as well as a set of screws and plastic straps that you can use to mechanically secure the boxes to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I got home, I plugged the device in, and... it's kind-of disappointing what they did with the hardware, to be honest. The device has a few animations, selectable by pressing a button on the back of the device; there is a little microphone in the box and every time it detects noise, it will advance the animation by one frame. The animations all are not very impressive: they're only four or five frames long, and the frames themselves are black-and-white only; no grayscales. If you're interested: I made a quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWVWz5w-9Dc&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of all the animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this won't do. Let's crack it open and see what makes this thing tick, and if it can be made a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nintendo’s Philosophy: Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology (2015)</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@adamagb/nintendo-s-little-known-product-philosophy-lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology-bac7257d8f4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@adamagb/nintendo-s-little-known-product-philosophy-lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology-bac7257d8f4</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;a8df&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;‘Cutting-edge’ is the term usually associated with blockbuster product releases, yet the philosophy of product development central to the thinking of one of the great innovators in video games eschewed creating new technology in favor of finding ways to give life to the tried-and-true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;d613&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;The man was Nintendo’s Gunpei Yokoi, chief creative force behind many of the company’s iconic inventions like the GameBoy and the D-Pad. Yet despite a long list of accomplishments, spanning software, hardware and toys, Yokoi’s most enduring contribution may have been his product philosophy, often translated to the almost luddite-sounding ‘lateral thinking with withered technology.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a2f4&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;The genius behind this concept is that for product development, you’re better off picking a cheap-o technology (‘withered’) and using it in a new way (‘lateral’) rather than going for the predictable, cutting-edge next-step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0970&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;What is Lateral Thinking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2b27&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Most product concepts are the result of iterative evolution. They tend to be slightly thinner, faster or differently hued than their competition. You can see them coming a generation away. By contrast lateral products are bold and surprising because they tackle their category orthogonally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;a634&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Take the iPod Shuffle: While many analysts predicted that Apple would release a down-market music player, nobody imagined they’d eliminate the screen and shape the device like a pack of gum. Lateral products don’t mind jettisoning industry-standard features and paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5631&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Iterative products might be hardest in execution (more on that soon), but lateral products tend to be hardest in conception. To build a lateral product, pick a starting point, the category or the technology. Since most of us work in a specific market but are technology agnostic, we’ll start with the category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f2b0&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs iu gu iv gw iw gy ix ha iy hc cx&quot;&gt;Imagine you’re working at a beverage company and are responsible for a new soda launch. Obvious ideas might be to develop a new flavor (pomegranate-cinnamon), upgrade an ingredient (rainforest dew sweetener) or go with licensing (Big Bang Theory soda). However, these ideas aren’t lateral as you’re just replacing one product feature for another. Instead, you have to approach soda in a structurally different way. Here are two strategies you might employ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2b0d&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;Soul Diving: What’s the Fundamental Product Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;64b6&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Focusing on the fundamental purpose of your product (its ‘soul’) empowers you to discard all of your accumulated assumptions. And this in turn will free you to take a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fc5d&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;During a &lt;a href=&quot;http://shmuplations.com/yokoi/&quot; class=&quot;bx ga iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;rare interview&lt;/a&gt;, Gunpei Yokoi was asked for his opinion on games of the time. His response demonstrates soul diving at its finest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;jd je jf&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fb9d&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap jg gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;There’s a huge variety of console games out now, but to me, the majority of them aren’t actually ‘games.’ The word ‘game’ means something competitive, where you can win or you can lose. When I look at recent games, I see that quality has been declining, and what I’m seeing more and more of are games that want to give you the experience of a short story or a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;145a&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;With our beverage venture we might ask, “What’s the real purpose of soda?” One idea might be that purpose of soda is on-the-go hydration, so a lateral move would be to drop the carbonation and additives, thus leaving us with bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a2af&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;Cross-Pollinating Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;996f&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Take your product category and then shuffle in a random idea. If creative sparks don’t fly, drop it and repeat the process until you stumble upon a combination that’s crazy enough to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;87fb&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Entrepreneur James Altucher is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/04/how-to-have-great-ideas/&quot; class=&quot;bx ga iz ja jb jc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;enthusiastic advocate&lt;/a&gt; of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;jd je jf&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;195b&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap jg gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;When I started Stockpickr it was the mating of my ideas on the Internet with my ideas for a new hedge fund. The best ideas always come from mating. Think of Hollywood. When they pitch an idea its never just “I have this idea”. Its always “It’s James Bond meets Titanic”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7b60&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;An obvious example of this would be Vitamin Water. A more creative beverage idea might be to combine soda and music, so that the bottle can be used as a musical instrument during consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;61e9&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;One should keep in mind that while cross-pollination is a fun approach, it can also be scattershot. So to avoid this Gunpei Yokoi would often cross-pollinate ideas with and under the constraint of what he called ‘withered technologies.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7a90&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;Avoiding the Cutting Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d04e&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;More often than not startups and R&amp;amp;D labs take a new generation of technology and rush to apply this to their chosen product category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0c06&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;The challenge of this approach is that it’s hard to get the cutting-edge to work well out of the gate. There are too many risky unknowns, which lead to compromises, bloated budgets and even wholesale cancellation. Competition is also tougher, with everyone bumping into each other trying to come up with a better mousetrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2996&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;So while it’s a noble endeavor for you to develop a new soda sweetener with a modest 20% fewer calories, there are, as the military calls them, “known unknown” pitfalls. A supply shortage may skyrocket your target price point midway through development or an unseemly side effect may surface among a portion of your population. Even if everything goes smoothly, you may still wake up to a “bring back the original formula” petition which garners national press attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0b00&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;Withered: Abundant, Well-Understood &amp;amp; Cheap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ace3&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Gunpei Yokoi believed that the rewards for using cutting-edge technology weren’t always proportional to the effort. That’s why he tried to limit himself to withered technologies. And it’s important to note that his use of the word ‘withered’ didn’t refer to old or obsolete technologies. This was a poor translation of the original, which was much closer in spirit to ‘weathered.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;9688&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs iu gu iv gw iw gy ix ha iy hc cx&quot;&gt;Withered technologies are abundant, well-understood and cheap. Examples could include AA batteries, aluminum cans or the Python programming language. So for a soda executive high fructose corn syrup is withered, while premium organic agave syrup is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;546e&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Limiting yourself to withered building blocks can be the difference between niche novelty and a mainstream blockbuster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;bfe8&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Withered constraints will push you creatively, yet allow you to scale to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7477&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;gr ic&quot;&gt;Combining the Two: A Case Study in Virtual Reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3ee5&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Sadly, Gunpei Yokoi’s biggest product failure came only two years before his untimely death. Despite Yokoi’s protests that the virtual reality console in his lab wasn’t ready for prime time, Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy to scathing reviews and lackluster sales. Some speculate the public embarassment led to his resignation. So it’s a measure of poetic justice that the Oculus Rift, which was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion and is poised to bring VR to the masses, was built using Yokoi’s philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;90cd&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;While you may think of virtual reality as the definition of a cutting-edge category, the Oculus Rift’s two most important components are a cheap smartphone screen and a pair of fifty cent lenses. These two withered parts allowed for mainstream pricing ($350) and freed the team to work on peripheral innovations like decreasing latency and refining positional tracking. Had they gone with custom parts, they might have achieved a higher quality product but at the cost of niche pricing or absurd graphic card requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c65f&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;Most people tend to assume that new products are the result of looking at tomorrow’s technologies and working backwards from there. Gunpei Yokoi had a different idea. He looked at present-day technologies and figured out how to package them into exciting products for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c03d&quot; class=&quot;gp gq ap ce gr b gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc cx&quot;&gt;What’s great about this approach is that it isn’t just good business, it’s also good fun. The process is more creative, the headaches less painful and the end result is more likely to delight, draw attention and win in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
