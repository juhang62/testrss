<title>VSCodium – An Open Source Visual Studio Code Without Trackers</title>
<link>https://www.fossmint.com/vscodium-clone-of-visual-studio-code-for-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fossmint.com/vscodium-clone-of-visual-studio-code-for-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We have covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/microsofts-visual-studio-code-editor-for-linux/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; before so you must know how much of an awesome code editor it is. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/microsofts-visual-studio-code-editor-for-linux/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is open source freeware, its source code is only available on Microsoft’s official GitHub repo and its downloads are licensed under a closed source license which contains telemetry so you’ll be happy with the app we have for you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VSCodium&lt;/a&gt; is a tracking-free, free and open source build of &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; created so that developers will not have to build &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; from source which contains telemetry/trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fit is accomplished by using special scripts to clone the &lt;code&gt;vscode&lt;/code&gt; repo, build it from source, and then upload the resulting binaries to &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium’s GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; releases free of telemetry passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; is a replica of &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; and thus, works in the same way with all the features and support present in its parent project. Except for the app icon – that’s different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10222&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCodium-Clone-of-VSCode.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the feature list in &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; is virtually inexhaustible. The same goes for &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Install VSCodium on Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; on any &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;-based distro like &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;. Take note of the pipe &lt;code&gt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;/code&gt; symbol used to join the commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add its repo’s GPG key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the repo to your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo 'deb https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/debs/ vscodium main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update your PC and install the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSCOdium&lt;/strong&gt; is installed by default on &lt;strong&gt;ParrotOS&lt;/strong&gt; and if it’s not installed on your system you can install it with the simple code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Fedora / Centos / OpenSUSE&lt;/strong&gt;, you can install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; using following commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the GPG key of the repository and install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; as shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 
&lt;strong&gt;-------- On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL --------&lt;/strong&gt;
# dnf config-manager --add-repo https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/rpms/
# dnf install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-------- On OpenSUSE/SUSE --------&lt;/strong&gt;
# zypper addrepo -t YUM https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/rpms/ vscodium_mirror_on_gitlab
# zypper in vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, you can transfer your tools and preferences from &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; using the instruction manual &lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/#migrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Are you using a different OS? See how to install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; on your system &lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/#install&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;? I imagine that developers who didn’t want to fork &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; because of the info that Microsoft tracks will happily jump at &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;. Tell us what you think in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology theft and other unfair business practices originating from China are costing the American economy more than $57 billion a year, White House officials believe, and they expect that figure to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet an investigation by NPR and the PBS television show &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; into why three successive administrations failed to stop cyberhacking from China found an unlikely obstacle for the government — the victims themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container medium btmbar&quot; id=&quot;con712686113&quot; previewtitle=&quot;About This Story&quot;&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;res712688478&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap statichtml&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/images/branding/third_party/npr-frontline.png&quot; alt=&quot;NPR and Frontline&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bucket&quot; readability=&quot;12.315789473684&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is part of a joint investigation with the PBS series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.pbs.org_wgbh_frontline_&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=E2nBno7hEddFhl23N5nD1Q&amp;amp;r=1VZdDzk9hRfgqzJDG4YkfOIGa0yK5RWvkExYHBGCZKo&amp;amp;m=bIYy0zwtpzzclmLzIHSxkal7LcKGa-0th__r_kT7PBw&amp;amp;s=K-n5e2jrfgffyD8mr02eBSOIxxAAby0jKdGTAyvbssQ&amp;amp;e=&quot;&gt;Frontline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which includes an upcoming documentary, &lt;em&gt;Trump's Trade War&lt;/em&gt;, scheduled to air May 7, 2019, on PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take &quot;any strong action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us,&quot; she says. &quot;Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; that it has been involved in such practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendy Cutler, a former diplomat and negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, delivers a 2015 speech at the Asia Society in Hong Kong.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not what former U.S. Attorney David Hickton found. When he took over in the Western District of Pennsylvania in 2010, he says, he was inundated with calls from companies saying they suspected China might be inside their computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I literally received an avalanche of concern and complaints from companies and organizations who said, 'We are losing our technology — drip, drip, drip,' &quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickton opened an investigation and quickly set his sights on a special unit of the Chinese military — a secretive group known as Unit 61398. Investigators were able to watch as the unit's officers, sitting in an office building in Shanghai, broke into the computer systems of American companies at night, stopped for an hour break at China's lunchtime and then continued in the Chinese afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were really using a large rake — think of a rake [like] you rake leaves in the fall,&quot; he says. &quot;They were taking everything ... personal information, strategic plans, organizational charts. Then they just figured out later how they were going to use it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Hickton went to the companies, eager for them to become plaintiffs, he ran into a problem. None of the companies wanted any part of it. Hickton says they had too much money on the line in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we were tone-deaf to is [that] we seemed to think we could just walk in and wave the flag of the USA,&quot; Hickton says, &quot;and it just didn't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, five years later, Hickton still won't name most of the companies involved — and they have never come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he was able to convince &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor&quot;&gt;five largely local companies&lt;/a&gt; and the steelworkers union to come forward, mostly, he says, because he grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school with a lot of the managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew these people,&quot; Hickton says. &quot;They trusted me. ... We couldn't ask them to be patriotic at the expense of engendering a shareholder case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, he could have included hundreds — or even thousands — more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've made a terrible mistake by being so secretive about our cyberwork,&quot; he says. &quot;We have not fairly told the people we represent what the threats are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government and business leaders interviewed by NPR and &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; said individual companies were making millions of dollars in China over the past decade and a half and didn't want to hurt short-term profits by coming forward. They demanded secrecy, even in the face of outright theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/china_e.htm&quot;&gt;officially joined&lt;/a&gt; the World Trade Organization in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work,&quot; Wessel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn't come forward publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The business community wanted the administration to come in hard without anyone's fingerprints being on the reasoning behind it,&quot; he says. &quot;They wanted the profits, but they also didn't want the possible retribution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wessel says that was never going to work. While nothing in the original trade agreements specifically mentions cybertheft, the U.S. could have brought criminal cases forward, enacted sanctions or opened investigations under rules set up by the World Trade Organization — if a company would let it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court cases and documents from recent years offer a clue into what experts believe has really been going on. The Chinese government has been accused of stealing everything from vacuum cleaner designs to solar panel technology to the blueprints of Boeing's C-17 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers from China, often with ties to the government, have been accused of breaking into gas companies, steel companies and chemical companies. Not long ago, Chinese government companies were indicted for stealing the secret &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-chinese-defendants-charged-economic-espionage-and-theft-trade-secrets-connection&quot;&gt;chemical makeup of the color white&lt;/a&gt; from DuPont. China developed its J-20 fighter plane, a plane similar to Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor, shortly after a Chinese national was indicted for stealing technical data from Lockheed Martin, including the plans for the Raptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese hacking made occasional headlines, but none really grabbed Americans' attention. There was one exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Google went public in announcing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122703950&quot;&gt;it had been hacked&lt;/a&gt; by the Chinese government. Thirty-four other American companies that were also part of the hack stayed silent. Most have kept it a secret to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPR tracked down 11 of the total 35 companies. All of them either did not respond to NPR's request or declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former top Google official who was closely involved in managing the hack told NPR that Google was &quot;infuriated&quot; that no other company would come forward, leaving Google to challenge China alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[We] wanted to out all of the companies by name,&quot; said the official, who spoke on the condition their name not be used because they did not have permission from Google to speak about the incident. &quot;One of the companies we called, said 'Oh, yeah, we've been tracking this for months.' It was unbelievable. The legal department talked us out of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We felt like we stood up and did the right thing,&quot; the former official said. &quot;It felt like Helm's Deep, the battle from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; in which you're impossibly surrounded and severely outnumbered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who was there at the time, says the companies kept even business organizations like his from speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What they should have done is held a press conference and say, 'We 35 businesses have been hacked,' and you would have put it right back on China,&quot; says McGregor. &quot;Instead, they just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGregor says their silence left little room for punishment, and worse, he says, it hid the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the ocean, cybersleuth Dmitri Alperovitch was sitting at his desk at a security company in Atlanta when Google called looking for backup. He says when he took a look, he was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew pretty much right away this is something very different,&quot; says Alperovitch, who is co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. &quot;For the first time we were facing a nation-state and intelligence service that was breaking into companies — not governments, not militaries, but private sector organizations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, U.S. government officials were nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They did not even publicly concur with the attributions that Google had made at the time,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama administration officials say they did not turn a blind eye to the Google hack or cybertheft from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration was struggling with other important priorities, such as North Korea, Iran, the economy and climate change, says Evan Medeiros, Obama's top China specialist and then a staffer at the National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Direct confrontation with China does not usually result in lasting solutions,&quot; Medeiros says, noting that President Obama &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/25/443448379/u-s-china-to-unveil-plan-to-curb-greenhouse-gases&quot;&gt;secured an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt the attacks and put together a regional trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — to add pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither measure lasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hindsight is always 20/20,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish that we had spent more time ... finding creative ways to punish them for creating a nonlevel playing field.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without those punishments, the attacks continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year after the Google hack, Alperovitch uncovered two more serious intrusions that, he says, involved thousands of American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2011, he went to the White House to warn officials about what he had found. He sat down in the Situation Room with a half-dozen top administration leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most surprising thing to me was the lack of surprise,&quot; Alperovitch says. &quot;I got the distinct impression that none of this was news. When I pressed them on why they were not taking stronger action against China, their response was, 'We have a multifaceted relationship with China.' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alperovitch says White House officials told him that some of the same companies that were being victimized by China also wanted to continue doing business in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They didn't want to take any action that would jeopardize that billions of dollars of trade we were doing at the time,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask McGregor, the American business representative, how companies can complain about China's behavior to the U.S. government while simultaneously preventing the government from taking strong action, and his answer is blunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Companies were afraid of China,&quot; he says. &quot;American business companies' incentives are to make money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGregor today advises dozens of American companies in China, and he says they are confronting a new reality. China is no longer an up-and-comer — it's a true competitor and quickly closing in on America's high-tech sector. McGregor says company leaders are beginning to ask whether years of theft and hacking have given China an edge that the United States will no longer be able to stay in front of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And U.S. government officials are asking whether federal agencies will be able to catch up on enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if the theft had been openly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at the Defense Department, as late as 2014, cybertheft from China was not one of the Pentagon's top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our intelligence agencies were looking at the Middle East, at the Russians,&quot; says Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, a China expert who worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he had never given the issue of Chinese cybertheft much thought. But then, in the fall of 2014, he loaded a confidential briefing into his computer. It was case after case in which the Chinese government had stolen the product designs from almost a dozen high-tech American companies, in a couple of cases almost putting them out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It immediately changed my conception, my view of the world,&quot; he says. &quot;I realized I did not know how the world worked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spalding says he made it his mission to get the word out to other government agencies. But even in 2015, he says, he was met mostly with a shrug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he went to the departments of Commerce and the Treasury, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The two responses we got were, 'Oh my gosh, this is really, really bad.' And the second one is, 'That's not my job,'&quot; Spalding says. &quot;That was almost the universal answer we got every time we went to a senior leader. Bad problem but not my problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spalding, who retired from the Air Force last year, says in the final years under Obama and now under President Trump, agencies are finally starting to take some action. The Justice Department is bringing criminal cases, the trade representative's office is investigating China's dealings and both administrations have brought concerns to the Chinese directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Spalding says, it may have come 10 years too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all missed it,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to understand the problem and get to work on it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Please Don&amp;#039;t Say Just Hello In Chat (2013)</title>
<link>http://www.nohello.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.nohello.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello.
## CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's as if you called someone on the phone and said &quot;Hi!&quot; and then put them on hold!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Please do this instead:&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Note that you get help minutes sooner, and you don't make them wait. Instead, the co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The same goes for &quot;Hello -- Are you there?&quot;, &quot;Hi Bob -- quick question.&quot;, &quot;Do you have a sec ?&quot;, &quot;yt?&quot; and &quot;ping&quot;. Just ask the question!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you feel it's brusque to simply say &quot;Hi&quot; and ask the question, you can do something like this:&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question.  I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a &quot;Hello&quot; and wondering what they missed.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Short link to this page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nohello.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;http://nohello.com/&lt;/a&gt;. (If you see that as someone's status, please be prepared to be ignored if you only say &quot;Hello!&quot;.)&lt;/div&gt;

<title>IPFS Project Roadmap</title>
<link>https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPFS Mission Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that all people have the ability to efficiently access and grow humanity's knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindfully develop new technologies that preserve and promote rights of individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support a persistent, upgradable, and open internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All information on the internet should be uniquely and permanently content-addressed on a distributed peer-to-peer web.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2019 Priority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be focusing our efforts into a single (lazer focus) priority. &lt;strong&gt;📦 Package Managers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding end-to-end support for package managers will provide a verifiable and co-hostable foundation for a vital use-case that we rely on. It will focus us on delivering performance and stability improvements while introducing IPFS to a huge community who have the skills to contribute back. See inbound interest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22package+managers%22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we will continue supporting &lt;strong&gt;🤝 Community Growth&lt;/strong&gt; in the best way we can, without diverging too much from our main Priority. We want ensure that we are setting up our community for success by addressing key needs to unlock their growth in 2019. Making our users successful and delivering on their top needs to ensure they have a smooth and productive experience with IPFS helps us retain and gain adoption, grow our community, increase our impact, and demonstrate our maturity as a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why setting a single priority?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 priority is geared to grow our maturity as a project, increase our adoption and community, and set ourselves up for the future. To be successful, we need to level-up our ability to land complete, polished, and accessible improvements that meet our user's needs for stability, scalability, privacy, and security. We need to keep growing intelligently, both by the types of communities that can help us accelerate growth and by the number of users they can help us reach. And we need to set ourselves up with the understanding and capabilities to reach our future goals for the project and scale our impact. We are confident that by aligning on &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; ambitious priority, we will be leveling up the core baseline of the IPFS Protocol, making it ready to tackle all the other goals that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us identify our top priority, we designed a sorting function to prioritize goals that 1) we can land end-to-end in 2019, 2) will bring new partners and users into the community, and 3) will set us up for future goals while delivering near-term value. After sorting, we identified what was the most achiavable (lower D) with largest Ecosystem Growth (higher E) and that would translate into Impact to our Ecosystems and Project (higher I).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorting Function Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = Difficulty (or &quot;Delta&quot; or &quot;Distance&quot;), &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = Ecosystem Growth, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; = Importance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each goal was given a score from 1 (low) - 5 (high) on each axis. We sorted first in terms of low difficulty or &quot;delta&quot; (i.e. minimal additional requirements and fewer dependencies from the capabilities IPFS has now), then high ecosystem growth (growing our community and resources to help us gravity assist and accelerate our progress), and finally high importance (we want IPFS to have a strong, positive impact on the world). See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#2019-goals-expanded&quot;&gt;2019 Goals (expanded)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#2020-goals&quot;&gt;2020+ Goals&lt;/a&gt; sections for sorted priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February Roadmap Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rescoped our 2019 priorities in early Q1 to narrow in from 3 top-level priorities (also including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#-large-files-d1-e4-i3&quot;&gt;Large Files&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#-decentralized-web-d2-e4-i3&quot;&gt;Decentralized Web&lt;/a&gt;) to one (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#-package-managers-d1-e5-i3&quot;&gt;Package Managers&lt;/a&gt;) - so we could focus on doing the most important work &lt;em&gt;really well&lt;/em&gt; instead of spreading ourselves too thin on many priorities, which we already felt ourselves doing. This descoping impacted the working group roadmaps we had drafted, and the Q1 OKRs we had already taken on. However, we decided to finish out our Q1 endeavors while we descoped our working group roadmaps and packaged up out-of-scope projects to set down smoothly, and to start our revamped roadmaps in Q2 with more focused and streamlined objectives, initiatives, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2019 Working Groups Roadmaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPFS project is the collective work of serveral focused teams, called Working Groups. Each group defines its own roadmap with tasks and priorities derived from the main IPFS Project Priority for 2019 described above. You can drill-down into each roadmap to get the full picture, or jump to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#2019-epics&quot;&gt;2019 epics&lt;/a&gt; section below for the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2019 IPLD &amp;amp; libp2p Roadmaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the IPFS sister projects' Roadmaps at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2019 Epics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've distilled the key themes from the Working Group Roadmaps into a list of &lt;strong&gt;Epic Endeavours&lt;/strong&gt; that give an overview of the primary targets IPFS has for 2019. If you are pumped about these Epics and want to help, you can get involved! See the call to action (CTA) for each section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. The reference implementations of the IPFS Protocol (Go &amp;amp; JS) becomes Production Ready&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been working hard on improving and iterating on the IPFS Protocol to make sure it serves its users needs and achieves the goal of giving the Web a new super power: Content Addressing. In 2019 we will solidify the core components and ensure IPFS is ready for production systems. Our goals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IPFS core solidified and APIs revamped/crystalized to be future-proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Specification of the Protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Audits and Security Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go and JS IPFS enable modern IPFS data formats (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/unixfs-v2&quot;&gt;UnixFSv2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipld/cid&quot;&gt;CIDv1&lt;/a&gt;, raw blocks) by default and in a reproducible way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The migration to Base32 CIDs is completed across all projects and IPFS Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can contribute to these Epic by testing, debugging, documenting or coding on either Go or JS IPFS. Both teams have a chat every week that you can join. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/MGMT_GOLANG_CORE_DEV.md&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/MGMT_JS_CORE_DEV.md#weekly-core-dev-team-calls&quot;&gt;JS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Support Software Package Managers in entering the Distributed Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Package Managers are an ideal use-case for Content Addressing. Developers could fetch packages team mates on their local network instead of asking a centralized Package Registries and our tools could verify that the code we run is exactly the code that the authors intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kick-off a Package Managers Working Group to work closely with different Package Managers and understand each one challenges and needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish a report on the results from adding the NPM Registry to IPFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet the scalability and performance needs to serve the Package Management user-case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be booting the Package Managers Working Group in early 2019, meanwhile, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/npm-on-ipfs&quot;&gt;NPM on IPFS&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx&quot;&gt;GX&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for what IPFS can contribute to Package Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Scale the IPFS Network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support the continued growth of the IPFS Network, we will be testing and benchmarking the protocol at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploy a P2P testbed for Distributed Protocols that enables us to spin up hundreds of thousands of nodes on demand and run tests on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPFS has an opt-in Telemetry system so that tests can collect key data to understand the experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends from libp2p will be playing the larger role in achieving this goal. If you are a Networks specialist and/or if you like scaling systems to serve hundreds of millions, join the conversation in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libp2p/team-mgmt#bi-weekly-call&quot;&gt;Bi-Weekly Libp2p Call&lt;/a&gt; and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. The IPFS Community of Builders gets together for the 1st &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/camp&quot;&gt;IPFS Camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read the title right. The IPFS Community is going to meet for the first large IPFS Event. This will be an event for all the users and builders of the DWeb to come together to learn about the exciting progress that has been happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Host the 1st Conference for the IPFS Community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details will be public soon. Subscribe for updates &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/camp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. IPFS testing, benchmarks, and performance optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare ourselves for production readiness and ensure IPFS is optimized for a variety of real-world use cases, we'll double down on testing and benchmarking in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing harness and environments that simulate different topologies / network configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests for Interoperability, Performance Benchmarks, Reliability, and Network churn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance overhaul for resolving (IPNS), finding (Providers), transferring, and adding files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Support the growing IPFS Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPFS Community is composed of many enthusiasts from the DWeb, P2P, Crypto, Privacy, builders, Web 3.0, Blockchain and many more. Today we have an impressive 3700+ contributors directly improving the IPFS, libp2p, IPLD and Multiformats repos, but there are tens of thousands more contributing to Apps, Libraries and Systems that build on top of IPFS everyday! In 2019, we want to provide a rich platform for all these contributors to share their ideas, get their questions heard, cross-pollinate and tackle new challenges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The documentation on IPFS and its libraries gets revamped and becomes part of continuous delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase awareness and adoption through Community outreach via presentations, guides / how-tos, meetups, and quarterly IPFS Project updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support contributor productivity and impact through Quarterly User Reports, fast code reviews, and DevOps automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create IPFS Dev Grant and Research Grant programs to encourage global engagement with the cutting-edge work in the IPFS ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://proto.school/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ProtoSchool&lt;/a&gt;, an interactive way to learn how to build on the P2P Web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPFS Community Meetups receive an upgrade with education materials (guides, tutorials, workshops, talks) to boost the leveling up DWeb communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2019 Goal (expanded)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📦 Package Managers (D1 E5 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most used code and binary Package Managers are powered by IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package Managers collect and curate sizable datasets. Top package managers distribute code libraries (eg npm, pypi, cargo, ...), binaries and program source code (eg apt, pacman, brew ...), full applications (app stores), datasets, and more. They are critical components of the programming and computing experience, and are the perfect use case for IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most package managers can benefit tremendously from the content-addressing, peer-to-peer, decentralized, and offline capabilities of IPFS. Existing Package Managers should switch over to using IPFS as a default, or at least an optional way of distributing their assets, and their own updates. New Package Managers should be built entirely on IPFS. --- Code libraries, programs, and datasets should become permanent, resilient, partition tolerant, and authenticated, and IPFS can get them there. Registries become curators and seeds, but do not have to bear the costs of the entire bandwidth. Registries could become properly decentralized. --- We have a number of challenges ahead to make this a reality, but we are already beyond half-way. We should be able to get top package managers to (a) use IPFS as an optional distribution mechanism, then (b) use that to test all kinds of edge cases in the wild and to drive performance improvements , then (c) get package managers to switch over the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2020+ Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following years' plan will be laid out during 2019. One of the goals for 2019 is to have a high-level 5 year (or decade) long view of the IPFS Project focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🗂 Large Files (D1 E4 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2020, IPFS becomes the default way to distribute files or collections of files above 1GB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is not good for distributing large files or large collections of small files. Anything above 1GB starts running into problems (resuming, duplication, centralized bandwidth limitations, etc). BitTorrent works well for single archives that won't change, or won't duplicate, but fails in a number of places. IPFS has solved most of the hard problems but hasn't yet made the experience so easy that people default to IPFS to distribute large files. IPFS should solve this problem so well, it should be so easy and delightful to use, and it should be so high performance that it becomes the default way to move anything above 1GB world-wide. This is a massive hole right now that IPFS is well-poised to fill -- we just need to solve some performance and usability problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🔄 Decentralized Web (D2 E4 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS supports decentralized web apps built on p2p connections with power and capabilities at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In web 2.0, control of the web is centralized - its location-addressing model and client-server architecture encourage reliance and trust of centralized operators to host services, data, and intermediate connections. Walled gardens are common, and our data is locked into centralized systems that increase the risk of privacy breaches, state control, or that a single party can shut down valued services. The decentralized web is all about peer-to-peer connections and putting users in control of their tools and data. It does this by connecting users directly to each other and using verifiable tools like hash-links and encryption to ensure the power and control in the network is retained by the participants themselves. The decentralized web (as distinguished from Distributed Web) is NOT about partition tolerance, or making the web work equally well in local-area networks/mobile/offline - the focus here is on the control and ownership of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS has solved most of the hard underlying design problems for decentralized web, but hasn't yet made the experience easy enough for end-users to experience it in the applications, tools, and services they use. This requires tooling and solutions for developers to sustainably run their business without any centralized intermediary facilitating the network (though centralized providers may still exist to augment and improve the experience for services that already work decentralized by design). Designing Federation for interop with current systems is key for the Migration Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🔒 Encrypted Web (D2 E3 I4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps and Data are fully end-to-end encrypted at rest. Users have reader, writer, and usage privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps and user data on IPFS are completely end-to-end encrypted, at rest, with only users having access. Users get reader and writer privacy by default. Any nodes providing services usually do so over encrypted data and never get access to the plain data. The apps themselves are distributed encrypted, decrypted and loaded in a safe sandbox in the users' control. Attackers (including ISPs) lose the ability to spy on users' data, and even which applications users are using. This works with all top use case apps -- email, chat, forums, collaboration tools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;♻️ Distributed Web (D2 E2 I4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Info and apps function equally well in local area networks and offline. The Web is a partitionable fabric, like the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web and mobile -- the most important application platforms on the planet -- are capable of working entirely in sub-networks. The norm for networked apps is to use the available data and connections, to sync asynchronously, and to leverage local connectivity protocols. The main apps for every top use case work equally well in offline or local network settings. It means IPFS and apps on top work excellently on desktops, the browser, and mobile. Users can use webapps like email, chat, forums, social networks, collaboration tools, games, and so on without having to be connected to the global internet. Oh, and getting files from one computer to another right next to it finally becomes an easy thing to do (airdrop level of easy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;👩🏽‍💻 Personal Web (D3 E4 I2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Data and programs are under user control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memex becomes reality. The web becomes a drastically more personal thing. Users' data and exploration is under the users' control -- similar to how a &quot;personal computer&quot; is under the user's control, and &quot;the cloud&quot; is not. Users decide which apps and other people get access to their data. Explorations can be recorded for the user in memex fashion. The user gets to keep copies of all the data they have observed through the web. A self-archiving personal record forms, which the user can always go back to, explore, and use -- whether or not those applications are still in development by their authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;👟 Sneaker Web (D3 E2 I4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web functions over disconnected sneaker networks, spreading information, app data, apps, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web is capable of working fully distributed, and can even hop across disconnected components of the internet. Apps and their data can flow across high latency, intermittent, asynchronous links across them. People in disconnected networks get the same applications, the same quality of experience, and the same ability to distribute their contributions as anybody in the strongest connected component (&quot;the backbone of the internet&quot;). The Web is totally resistant to large scale partitions. Information can flow so easily across disconnected components that there is no use in trying to block or control information at the borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🚀 Interplanetary Web - Mars 2024. (D3 E3 I4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mars&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's live the interplanetary dream!**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX plans to land on mars in 2022, and send humans in 2024. By then, IPFS should be the default/best choice for SpaceX networking. The first humans on mars should use IPFS to run the top 10 networked apps. That means truly excellent and well-known IPFS apps addressing the top 10 networked use cases must exist. For that to happen, the entire system needs to be rock solid, audited, performant, powerful, easy-to-use, well known, and so on. It means IPFS must work on a range of platforms (desktop, servers, web, mobile), and to work with both special purpose local area networks, and across interplanetary distances. If we achieve this, while solving for general use and general users (not specifically for the Mars use case, then IPFS will be in tremendous standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;💾 Packet Switched Web (D3 E2 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS protocols use packet switching, and the network can relay all kinds of traffic easily, tolerating switch failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure protocols (libp2p, IPFS, etc.) and the end-user app protocols (the logic of the app) can work entirely over a packet switching layer. Protocols like BitSwap, DHT, PubSub become drastically higher performance, and unconstrained by packets sent before theirs. Web applications can form their own isolated virtual networks, allowing their users to distribute the packets. Users can form their own groups and their own virtual networks, allowing users to only operate in a subnet they trust, and ensure all of their traffic is moving between trusted switches. The big public network uses packet switching by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📑 Data Web (D4 E3 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large Datasets are open, easy to access, easy to replicate, version controlled, secure, permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly loose access to important information, either because it ceases to exist or simply due to &lt;em&gt;virtual virtual&lt;/em&gt; barriers (i.e. censorship, lack of connectivity and so on). Information also often looses its way into the peers that most needed it and there aren't good ways to signal that some dataset wasn't contemplated, referenced. We want to improve this dramatically, making the data that is produced more easy to access through making it versionased, secure and easier to replicate and locate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✉️ Package Switched Web (D4 E2 I2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data in the web can be moved around over a package switching network. Shipping TB or PB hard drives of data becomes normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond circuit switching and packet switching, the web works over package switching! It is possible to send apps, app assets, app user generated data, and so on through hard drives means. This means that the network stack and the IPLD graph sync layers are natively capable of using data in external, removable media. It is easy for a user Alice to save a lot of data to a removable drive, for Alice to mail the drive to another user Bob, and for Bob to plug in the drive to see his application finish loading what Alice wanted to show Bob. Instead of having to fumble with file exports, file systems, OS primitives, and worse -- IPFS, libp2p, and the apps just work -- there is a standard way to say &quot;i want this data in this drive&quot;, and &quot;i want to use the data from this drive&quot;. Once that happens, it can enable proper sneakernet web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;⛓ Self-Archiving Web (D4 E4 I4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web becomes permanent, no more broken Links. Increase the lifespan of a Webpage from 6 months to ∞ (as good as a book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive(s, plural) Content Address their snapshots to maximize deduplications and hit factor. IPFS becomes the platform that enables the multiple Internet Archives to store, replicate and share responsibility over who possesses what. It becomes simple for any institution (from large organization to small local library) to become an Internet Archive node. Users can search through these Internet Archives nodes, fully compliant with data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🏷 Versioning Datasets (D4 E3 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS becomes the default way to version datasets, and unlocks a dataset distribution and utility explosion similar to what VCS did for code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS emerged from dataset versioning, package management, and distribution concerns. There are huge gaping holes in this space because large datasets are very unwieldy and defy most systems that make small files easy to version, package, and distribute. IPFS was designed with this kind of problem in mind and has the primitives in place to solve many of these problems. There are many things missing: (a) most importantly, a toolchain for version history management that works with these large graphs (most of what git does). (b) Better deduplication and representation techniques. (c) Virtual filesystem support -- to plug under existing architectures. (d) Ways to easily wrap existing data layouts (filestore) -- to plug on top existing architectures. (e) An unrelenting focus on extremely high performance. (f) primitives to retrieve and query relevant pieces of versioned datasets (IPLD Selectors and Queries). --- But luckily, all of these things can be added incrementally to enhance the tooling and win over more user segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🗃 Interplanetary DevOps (D4 E2 I2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versioning, packaging, distribution, and loading of Programs, Containers, OSes, VMs, defaults to IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS is great for versioning, deduping, packaging, distributing assets, through a variety of mediums. IPFS can revolutionize computing infrastructure systems. It has the potential to become the default way for datacenter and server infrastructure users to set up their infrastructure. This can happen at several different layers. (a) In the simplest sense, IPFS can help distribute programs to servers, by sitting within the OS, and plugging in as the downloading mechanism (replace wget, rsync, etc.). (b) IPFS can also distribute containers -- it can sit alongside docker, kubernetes, and similar systems to help version, dedup, and distribute containerized services. (c) IPFS can also distribute OSes themselves, by plugging in at the OS package manager level, and by distributing OS installation media. (d) IPFS can also version, dedup, and distribute VMs, first by sitting alongside host OSes and hypervisors moving around VM snapshots, and then by modeling VMs themselves on top of IPFS/IPLD. --- To get there, we will need to solve many of the same problems as package managers, and more. We will need the IPLD importers to model and version the media super-effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;📖 The World's Knowledge becomes accessible through the DWeb (D5 E2 I5)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity deserves equal access to the Knowledge. Platforms such as Wikipedia, Coursera, Edx, Khan Academy and others need to be available independently of Location and Connectivity. The content of this services need to exist everywhere. These replicas should be part of the whole world's dataset and not disjoint dataset. Anyone should be able to access these through the protocol, without having to deploy new services per area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🌐 WebOS (D5 E2 I3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web Platform and the OS'es merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rift between the web and the OS is finally healed. The OS and local programs and WebApps merge. They are not just indistinguishable, they are &lt;em&gt;the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Installing&quot; becomes pinning applications to the local computer. &quot;Saving&quot; things locally is also just pinning. The browser and the OS are no longer distinguishable. The entire OS data itself is modelled on top of IPLD, and the internal FileSystem is IPFS (or something on top, like unixfs). The OS and programs can manipulate IPLD data structures natively. The entire state of the OS itself can be represented and stored as IPLD. The OS can be frozen or snapshotted, and then resumed. A computer boots from the same OS hash, drastically reducing attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>B.C. introduces law to require cars, trucks sold by 2040 be zero emission</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-introduces-law-to-require-cars-trucks-sold-by-2040-be-zero-emission-1.5093110</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-introduces-law-to-require-cars-trucks-sold-by-2040-be-zero-emission-1.5093110</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All light-duty cars and trucks sold in British Columbia would have to be zero-emission by 2040 under legislation tabled Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Energy Minister Michelle Mungall says the Zero Emission Vehicles Act aims to fight climate change by phasing out gas-powered vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says the legislation would set target dates of 10 per cent zero-emission sales by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2040.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legislation would apply to new vehicles for sale or lease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mungall says zero-emission vehicles are part of the government's $902 million CleanBC program to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 based on 2007 pollution levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says the CleanBC plan includes incentives for zero-emission vehicle purchases up to $5,000 on a new battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and up to $6,000 for a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;British Columbians are eager to make the switch to zero-emission vehicles,&quot; Mungall said in the legislature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We have the highest per capita adoption of zero-emission vehicles in Canada, with over 17,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road, averaging four per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2018.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The provincial government says the program will roll out starting with the 2020 model year but doesn't yet have emission targets for that year, as it's still consulting with the industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
