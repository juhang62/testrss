&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Snir David&quot; class=&quot;svelte-84fdln profile-big&quot; src=&quot;profile%20transparent.png&quot;/&gt; I'm Snir David, I'm a professional developer delivering quality code to production.&lt;/header&gt;
I post concise knowledge bits on my account &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/snird?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; class=&quot;twitter-follow-button&quot; data-show-count=&quot;false&quot; data-size=&quot;large&quot;&gt;Follow @snird&lt;/a&gt; Written communication is remote work super power 19/06/2020 









&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; An interesting discussion around this started in &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23577228&quot;&gt;hacker news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote work environment is different from the office. Different environments call for different communication systems. A communication system that is adapted to the remote work reality can unlock amazing benefits: (even) better productivity, a competitive advantage in the long run and much a better work-life balance on top of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous written communication is the tool best suited for remote work. We are so used to talking to each other in the office, expecting immediate responses in work chat, and having meetings all day, that we tried to replicate that at home with zoom and slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to each other in slack while expecting immediate answers, or setting up multiple zoom meetings every day will fail with remote work in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;remote&quot; class=&quot;svelte-82vn29&quot; src=&quot;/blog/remote-async-communication/remote.jpg&quot;/&gt; Photo by Goran Ivos on Unsplash

Using synchronous chats such as slack or Microsoft teams is not like talking to a teammate that sits next to you:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's harder to initiate. When it's a teammate beside to you, just talking is far easier than typing a question. This leads to quick and easy thing being dragged on longer than necessary because the teammate will first try to resolve it himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's too easy to initiate. When it's someone from different department, on the office he will usually first check up with his own teammates. But now, it's as easy to go directly to the source. So you'll be spammed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody expects an immediate response. It's a chat. It's designed to give us the feel of urgency. Even when it is not really urgent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll lose your history. Even if you invest time in explaining a concept of the company to someone in the chat, it's not saved anywhere in an organized or discoverable way. It'll be lost in the chat logs. Soon enough, you'll find yourself explaining the same stuff again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It promotes secrecy. People are naturally shy, and prefer not to show &quot;weakness&quot; to other teammates. So they will keep their questions and updates mostly in private chats or private rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Video meetings are problematic too:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only one person can talk at a time. In reality, more than one can talk and still everyone will be able to understand. This is a software limitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No side-talks. In reality, in big meetings you might whisper something to a sub-section group of people in the meeting. You can't do this in video meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This all leads to video meetings feeling more like a lecture. A true discussion is harder to facilitate (although not impossible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video calls are tiring. The camera is focused on your face and everyone sees you all the time. You can't lose focus or wander away to give your mind some rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we discard the specific tools of chats and video calls, we still have the underlying problems of synchronous communication. That is, communication that expects the other participants to respond within a very limited time span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that expectation promotes bad work culture and limits your flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone is expected to be available at any point, the cost of interrupting someone and getting an immediate answer is lower than looking for an answer yourself. Be it in the 3rd party documentation or the company's internal documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, if internal documentation even exists. When everybody expects to be asked about things anyway, why go through the effort of properly documenting anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning is another culprit. Most people will not go through proper in-depth planning for their tasks ahead of time. They'll prefer to define the end goal, and discover issues and details as they go. They know they will never get stuck, people will answer their questions on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a culture of interruptions in the organization. It feeds itself so deeply, that the organization can't really operate without interruption. Since the organization as a whole is dependent on that, it becomes part of the culture. Once you have culture of interruptions, even the best communicator in the world will not be able to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work time flexibility will be broken too. Since everyone is dependent on everyone else to be available for interruptions within the work day, you have a work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be in sync about your work day times with everyone else. You therefore give up the ability for real work time flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home and dreaming on picking up your children at noon, hangout with them and get back to some work later in the night? Forget about it. You will get stuck on something very quickly and no one will be there for you. Not to mention you will get your colleagues stuck as you won't answer their questions on the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real remote is out of the question too. You can't realistically have team members from the US and Europe and India together when you need everyone to be available at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing intentionally for asynchronous communication can solve all the issues mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Async writing is different from chat messages. It lives longer, targets more potential audience and is easy to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To live longer, the text needs to be aware of a larger reader group context. Where chats often consider just one/two readers that have the context to understand what you talk about, the long live text should consider entire group of potential readers. Now, and at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the text live longer and target wider audience, it needs to assume less pre-existing reader context. Chat messages target one/two readers, at a specific time. So they assume those readers have the current context that will be clear to them specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Async writing don't assume a specific person context nor does it assume &quot;current&quot; events knowledge. Surprisingly, that doesn't necessarily make the text longer or harder to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, we consider a scenario where we have a DB issue in our team in which the MySQL instance fails occasionally due to out-of-memory errors. Writing just for your team, they know what is the issue now and what DB it is. Others, might not know which DB have the issue (say you also use mongodb somewhere) not they know what the issue is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message sufficient for chat context that will not live long might be: &quot;I'll fix the DB today&quot;. Async text equivalent will be to log the issue in a system, mark it as &quot;working on it&quot; for today with the text &quot;MySQL out of memory issue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text is not longer, yet it has all the context any outsider might need to understand what is going on without the need to contact anyone asking &quot;What DB we have issue on?&quot; &quot;What is the issue?&quot; &quot;Since when do we know about it?&quot; &quot;Who's on it?&quot; etc' etc'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Async chat example&quot; class=&quot;async-chat-example svelte-1es0x9q&quot; src=&quot;/blog/remote-async-communication/async_chat_example.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discoverability is the next essential part of this communication system. You need your writings to be easily discoverable for everyone who might need them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on full-text search is usually not a good idea. You need organization system in place. Where tasks description go? Where the system design documents go? Do they all live in one place or per project? Or maybe per department in large organizations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every company have some sort of system, usually guided by their knowledge sharing too. Be it Jira, Basecamp, Monday or anything else. You just have to make sure the system is consistent and tight enough such that new people in a project will be able to self discover everything they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the MySQL issue example here too, let's say a new team member gets the task. The task is marked with tags &quot;database&quot;, &quot;infrastructure&quot;. He can follow the &quot;database&quot; tag to find recent past tasks done, to see if there are any obvious suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He finds none, so he decides to check if some data analyst did something spooky. He goes to the tasks list of the data analyst teams, finds tag &quot;new dashboard&quot;. Those look like a great lead, he find a new dashboard task was done the day the issue started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he needs to check out this dashboard, but it uses a visualization system he is not familiar with. He heads to the data team wiki, where he finds a document on &quot;how we use our visualization system&quot;. He sets up his credentials and gets in to explore the queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see where I'm getting with it. When everything is easily accessible and obvious, you can focus on the task itself without interruption to the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
Imagine a scenario where in each step you'd have to stop and ask someone:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Josh from my team: &quot;Hey, did someone do something to the DB recently?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dani from data team: &quot;Hey, did you launch or changed any heavy query recently?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ramon from data infrastructure: &quot;Hey, how do we use our visualization tool to edit a dashboard?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, you are dependent on other to be available and to remember all the answers. Your flow is constantly interrupted without any way to progress before you get answers. You can't focus on flexible work time, because you must have all the team members constantly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this essay I described why in my opinion synchronous communication as we use to do from the office is not optimal for remote. Then I demonstrated how async communication via writing can fix most of the synchronous communication culprits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synchronous communication while remote rely on chats and video calls, both are inferior communication tools trying to mimic office conversations. But they are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous communication is tiring, repetitive and takes away most of the remote work benefits (such as flexible hours, hiring from all over the world etc')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async communication allows for self discovery without interruptions:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can keep on your flow without waiting for someone to give you details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get into &quot;deep focus&quot; session without context switching that allows for better productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can work whenever, since you are not dependent on anyone immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async communication preserve the company knowledge better:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have written records of everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tutorials and guides are constantly refined, so people won't waste time on the same thing twice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have one place for knowledge via writing, instead of private knowledge in private calls or chat room that is lost soon after&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>BTFS – mount any .torrent file or magnet link as directory</title>
<link>https://github.com/johang/btfs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/johang/btfs</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With BTFS, you can mount any &lt;strong&gt;.torrent&lt;/strong&gt; file or &lt;strong&gt;magnet link&lt;/strong&gt; and then use it as any read-only directory in your file tree. The contents of the files will be downloaded on-demand as they are read by applications. Tools like &lt;strong&gt;ls&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cp&lt;/strong&gt; works as expected. Applications like &lt;strong&gt;vlc&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;mplayer&lt;/strong&gt; can also work without changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir mnt
$ btfs video.torrent mnt
$ cd mnt
$ vlc video.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unmount and shutdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ fusermount -u mnt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing on Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# apt-get install btfs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing on Arch Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# pacman -S btfs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing on Gentoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# emerge -av btfs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing on macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to install on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ brew install btfs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dependencies (on Linux)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fuse (&quot;fuse&quot; in Ubuntu 16.04)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building from git on a recent Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libfuse-dev libtorrent-rasterbar-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev g++
$ git clone https://github.com/johang/btfs.git btfs
$ cd btfs
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And optionally, if you want to install it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make install
&lt;/code&gt;

<title>Quit whining about Apple and just stop using them</title>
<link>https://rudism.com/quit-whining-about-apple-and-just-stop-using-them/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rudism.com/quit-whining-about-apple-and-just-stop-using-them/</guid>
<description>&lt;section&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-06-19T13:04:00.000Z&quot;&gt;2020-06-19&lt;/time&gt; (posted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rudism.com/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I have changed the name of the actual email company referred to by this story, simply for the reason that I’m not familiar enough with their service to feel comfortable contributing to all the free publicity they’re drumming up through this issue. If you’re out of the loop and want to learn more just click any of the links in the article and it won’t be too hard to track down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Controversy&quot;&gt;The Controversy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of hubbub in the tech sphere lately over an email service I will be calling Yo in this article, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-from-app-store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apple’s rejection of their iOS app&lt;/a&gt; due to Yo’s refusal to use Apple’s in-app purchase system to sell subscriptions. The reason Apple wants Yo to offer subscriptions via an in-app purchase is because that would give Apple a 30% cut of all subscription fees for all users who subscribe through the app in perpetuity (once a user has subscribed for over a year I think it may drop to 15%). Obviously Yo would prefer those users to sign up via their website instead, because then they get 100% of the subscription fees and Apple gets nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.4978540772532&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents — highway robbery, basically — bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market.” –Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the controversy lies around Apple’s selectively enforced policies around whether they allow apps in their app store that provide access to a subscription service without actually allowing users to subscribe through the app. An example of apps that skirt this policy are Netflix and Spotify–if you already have accounts you can use the iOS app to watch Netflix videos and listen to Spotify music on your iPhone, but if you don’t have an account not only do those apps not give you the option to subscribe, due to Apple’s policies they’re not even allowed to inform users that it’s possible to subscribe at all. Even a simple non-link message stating “Sign up for an account on the web” would be grounds for Apple to reject the app. Netflix made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/28/18159373/netflix-in-app-subscriptions-iphone-ipad-ios-apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;big stink&lt;/a&gt; about this when they removed the functionality a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yo’s plan seems to have been to follow the Netflix and Spotify model–provide an app that gives existing subscribers access to their email services, and simply eschew any in-app mechanism (or even mention of the possibility) for new users to sign up for Yo in order to avoid Apple skimming their cut from the subscription fees. The idea would presumably be that users will discover and subscribe to Yo’s services on their own and then install the companion iOS app only after they have already obtained an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, instead of giving Yo a pass as they did Netflix and Spotify and countless other apps, Apple stepped in and essentially said “Nah, fuck that, you either implement in-app subscriptions in your app and give us our 30% or you can go suck an egg,” and rejected an update to Yo’s app from their app store and have threatened to remove the app entirely unless Yo complies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.6451612903226&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple wants to own iPhone consumers so that anyone who wants access to that demographic must pay the toll and follow their rules. It’s far too much power for one corporation…” –matheusmoreira on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23571947&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Discrepancy&quot;&gt;The Discrepancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the discrepancy between Netflix and Spotify and Yo is, to me, perfectly obvious. Apple’s hand-wavy explanation has to do with nebulous definitions of “consumer” apps versus “commercial” apps or “reader” apps versus productivity apps, but in actuality the reason is money. Netflix is a huge company with somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 million subscribers world-wide, many of whom would balk at discovering they can’t watch Netflix shows on their phone. Spotify has somewhere around 150 million subscribers who would undoubtedly consider the inability to listen to their music on the $700 pocket-computer they either bought or are thinking about buying to be completely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other anomalous examples as well–The Audible app has no in-app subscription mechanism, Kindle doesn’t let you buy books through the iOS app, even other subscription-based email apps like Microsoft Outlook are permitted on the app store without giving Apple a cut. But are you noticing a trend there? Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft… these are all companies with enough size and clout that Apple could be in serious danger if any of them decided to pull their apps from iOS, and even more potential trouble if they decided to challenge Apple’s practices from a legal standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.5963302752294&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s baffling to me. I can buy a USD1k+ device and still not be able to install on it the apps I want because the manufacturer doesn’t want me to, and this is legal? Such horsecrap.” –notRobot on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23545771&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple remained consistent and diligent in their policy to demand a lifetime cut of all subscription services accessed via iOS apps and banned Netflix, Spotify, Audible, and Outlook from their devices, it would clearly cost Apple users and sales of those devices. Those services are big enough and an integral part of so many users’ mobile lives that people would switch to Android in droves to get them back. But for something like Yo, a brand-spanking new email service that just launched, Apple is more than happy to rake them over the coals in an attempt to get that money–nobody is going to cry over a new email service they’ve never heard of, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that in this case the new email service was founded by a company that also offers a well-established and very popular collaboration service for remote workers. While probably not in the same ballpark as Netflix or Spotify as far as subscriber count goes, this service is much-beloved among the extremely technically-literate–exactly the kind of people that Apple should probably avoid pissing off because when something catches their ire they’re pretty good at elevating it into general online consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to take a brief moment here to point out an amusing hypocrisy on Apple’s part. Google has a similar model to Apple for apps released on the Android app store–they take a 30% cut of the first year of every user’s subscription and then 15% after that in perpetuity, with the difference being that they do not ban apps for implementing alternate payment methods. When you publish an Android app you can freely choose between using Google’s subscription mechanism and paying them a cut, or implementing your own solution and not paying Google anything. I’ll give you one guess which one Apple has chosen when implementing the in-app subscription mechanism in the Android version of their Apple Music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Solution-for-Developers&quot;&gt;The Solution for Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple is behaving so unreasonably by rejecting apps for ridiculous anti-consumer reasons, why are we–both developers, who prop up their behavior by feeding their ecosystem with new apps; and consumers, who prop up their behavior by continuing to buy their overpriced hardware–continuing to support them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to that for developers seems just as obvious as Apple’s reasons for allowing Netflix and Spotify to remain on iPhones despite being in violation of app store policies. It’s all about money. Developers want access to that pre-existing user base of consumers who clearly have money to spend because they bought one of the most expensive phones on the market, but they want that access for free (or at least for cheaper than Apple has deemed it’s worth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.4634146341463&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“30% does seem a little bit high. What justification does Apple use for charging that much?” –joegibbs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23545815&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am in complete agreement that Apple’s policies and practices are egregious (if I had no knowledge of Apple in the real world and was reading a fictional story in which an antagonistic company behaved the way Apple does, I think I would probably discard it as absurdly unrealistic), I am also of the opinion that Apple has clearly earned the right to be evil assholes. They built products that people love, cultivated their brand through careful control of the media, and vaulted their company into the stratosphere. The idea that they have a “monopoly” seems patently ridiculous to me. A monopoly over what? Their own brand of computing devices that they are the sole manufacturers of? Operating systems for which they are the sole developers and maintainers? It’s not like there aren’t other devices and platforms to choose from if you don’t like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we tear down Apple through legal means–we send them the message that because they’re so successful they no longer have a right to dictate their own terms around what apps they allow on their devices and how much money they can charge developers to have access to their platform. &lt;em&gt;Just think of all the ways that precedent could be abused against other companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, hypothetically, that the Yo email service, through brilliant marketing and an amazing product, manages to grow their user base and capture the email market to unheard of levels. Those dudes make Gmail look like a Ma and Pa shop. Now let’s say they decide to offer a new service that allows content providers to reach Yo’s subscribers–like a newsletter or something. Should they be allowed to dictate how much a content provider must pay to have content in one of those newsletters? Or are they so big that they now have a “monopoly” over their own Yo newsletter and have to be taken down like Apple? Should we really be punishing companies for their own success? Who decides when that happens? How big is too big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitch please.” –Me, this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, it seems silly to me to cry about monopolies. The solution is obvious. Stop making apps for iOS. Sure, you’re going to take a huge hit without access to those consumers, but if your company or product is structured in such a way that it can’t survive without the ability to suckle at Apple’s teat then you’ve made bad decisions and in my opinion deserve whatever shit Apple decides to shovel at you because of it. By this point we already know that Apple is a fickle money-hungry beast who can and does destroy entire businesses that have made the mistake of hinging their success on Apple’s platform, and that’s a risk you either have to knowingly take or, ideally, just avoid entirely by giving Apple the middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t necessarily mean making your product or service completely unavailable on the iPhone–you can always write a mobile-friendly web app. Until, that is, Apple decides to block or break your app in Safari, which is technically the only web browser allowed on the iPhone (other browsers are available but due to more draconian app store policies they must use the same rendering engine that Safari uses, which gives Apple the same full control over how those browsers actually function under the hood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;The-Solution-for-Consumers&quot;&gt;The Solution for Consumers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop buying iPhones. Seriously. They’re overpriced and locked-down and controlled by Apple in infuriating ways that hurt you, even if Apple has succeeded in keeping you ignorant of that fact. Don’t buy Macs while you’re at it–while they’re not quite as restrictive as iPhones, it’s very clear that Apple wants them to be and they are quickly headed down the same consumer-harmful road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the devices are pretty and feel nice and maybe your friends all have one and you want to signal that you’re one of the crowd, but it’s not worth it. Apple should be punished for their horrendous behavior and the best way for us to do that is with our wallets. Get an Android, there are some nice ones out there just as pretty as iPhones and they tend to cost quite a bit less too. Or go full hipster and get a flip phone, I don’t know, just stop giving your money to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Sigh…&quot;&gt;Sigh…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I know none of these solutions are actually going to come to fruition. It’s how capitalism is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to work–companies that hurt consumers should not succeed while the competition that caters to consumers should succeed. But developers are going to keep chasing that Apple app store gold mine and consumers will keep buying the latest iPhone model at twice the price of their old one because that’s how capitalism really works. Companies that already hold all the power and money have the means to remain in that position and stifle any competition that could potentially topple them before it even gets off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the ultimate solution is an anti-trust legal one. Maybe companies shouldn’t be allowed to be as successful as Apple because of how it collectively hurts us all. In an ideal world people would recognize that they’re being hurt and punish the perpetrators, but we don’t live in an ideal world. In the case of Apple, consumers are largely unaware and frankly don’t care as long as they have their shiny new toys. Developers are more aware and like to bitch and moan but also don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; care because the potential payoff waiting for them if they can slip through Apple’s review process and gain access to that existing customer base is much simpler than trying to build a customer base from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hopes for such legal action ever succeeding are not particularly high. Especially in the USA where bribing politicians is essentially legalized through lobbying and Apple has such obscene amounts of money to toss their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first computer in grade school was a Macintosh Classic and I grew up with and owned Macs all the way through the PowerMac G4 line, so it pains me a bit to write all of this. Today I don’t support Apple at all. My phone is an Android (although I am considering alternatives to that as well) and my computers are all non-Macs running Linux and I haven’t developed software for any Apple platform in over a decade. The straw that broke my camel’s back came a long time ago. I urge everyone to ask yourselves where your limit is. How bad does Apple have to be before you’ll stop buying iPhones or developing iOS apps? How much control are you willing to give them over how you can use and access the devices that you pay so much money for?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft calls for a closer look at app stores</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296657/microsoft-apple-app-store-antitrust-comments</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296657/microsoft-apple-app-store-antitrust-comments</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;HhpQYq&quot;&gt;Microsoft believes it’s time for antitrust regulators to fully investigate Apple’s App Store. Speaking during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/618bsmlivestream&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; interview this week&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s chief legal officer Brad Smith outlined Apple’s walled garden approach to its App Store, and how it’s affecting competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4WQzfd&quot;&gt;“If you look at the industry today, I think what you’ll find is increasingly you’re seeing app stores that have created higher walls and far more formidable gates to access other applications than anything that existed in the industry 20 years ago,” says Smith. “They impose requirements that increasingly say there’s only one way to get onto our platform, and that is to go through the gate that we ourselves have created. In some cases they create a very high price for a toll, in some cases 30 percent of all your revenue has to go to the toll keeper if you will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EgwYml&quot;&gt;While Smith doesn’t name Apple, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/microsoft-says-antitrust-regulators-need-to-review-app-stores&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; confirmed&lt;/a&gt; with Microsoft that he’s referring to the App Store specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;zxlFlB&quot;&gt;This week may go down in history as a turning point for Apple’s App Store. The iPhone maker has been caught up in an ongoing debate over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&quot;&gt;controversial decision to reject the new Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;. Apple initially approved the app, but later decided it broke App Store rules. Apple has been accused of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020&quot;&gt;acting like a monopolist and a bully&lt;/a&gt; by the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hlXMIc&quot;&gt;Apple’s decision has put a spotlight on Apple’s confusing App Store policies, just as the European Commission announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay&quot;&gt;formal antitrust investigation into the App Store and Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes just days before Apple’s annual WWDC developer conference, putting the company in an awkward position to host an event to entice developers to create apps for its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R5MqU7&quot;&gt;“I do believe the time has come, whether we are talking about Washington DC or Brussels, for a much more focused conversation about the nature of app stores, the rules that are being put in place, the prices and tools that are being extracted, and whether there is really a justification in antitrust law for everything that has been created,” says Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DicOP3&quot;&gt;Microsoft obviously has some experience and history with antitrust cases, after it was found guilty of monopoly abuses related to its bundling of Internet Explorer in Windows nearly 20 years ago. Microsoft was ultimately forced to open up Windows more to third-party developers, and it faced closer scrutiny on its practices for years. The European Commission went even further, ordering Microsoft to create a separate version of Windows without its bundled Windows Media Player and create a browser ballot for consumers to pick their web browser of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;QpcxGh&quot;&gt;The EU’s investigation into Apple’s App Store is still at an early stage, so it’s not clear what type of measures will be taken, but Microsoft is certainly sitting on the sidelines and encouraging action. Microsoft has faced its own issues with Apple’s App Store. The software maker attempted to launch its SkyDrive (now named OneDrive) app for iPhones back in 2012, but got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/11/3753968/microsoft-apple-skydrive-discussions-ios-app-rumor&quot;&gt;locked in a battle&lt;/a&gt; over a 30 percent cut of revenue from purchases of cloud storage within the app. It was a minor scuffle that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/11/3755942/office-mobile-iphone-ipad-microsoft-apple-in-app-sales-cut-rumor&quot;&gt;was a testing point&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft’s launch of Office on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hwO1mz&quot;&gt;More recently, Microsoft has been battling to launch its xCloud game streaming service on iOS. The company has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134952/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-ios-beta&quot;&gt;launched a preview version&lt;/a&gt;, but “to comply with App Store policies,” the app only includes a single game and is limited compared to the Android version. Microsoft hasn’t revealed exactly why xCloud is limited by App Store policies. Apple previously revised its App Store policies during WWDC 2018 to allow mobile apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366662/steam-link-android-beta-valve-pc-game-streaming-service-launch&quot;&gt;Valve’s Steam Link game streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, but both xCloud and Google’s Stadia have been unable to launch fully in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;LaAw2d&quot;&gt;While Microsoft has clashed with Apple over its App Store policies, it’s also benefited through various promotions for its apps in the App Store. Microsoft also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650201/minecraft-earth-demo-apple-wwdc-2019-microsoft&quot;&gt;appeared on stage at WWDC last year&lt;/a&gt; to promote &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;, and the company has previously shown up at Apple events to tout Office improvements for iPhones and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iv7hPN&quot;&gt;Microsoft would benefit from a more open Apple App Store, both in terms of revenue and in how the company can design and launch apps. Microsoft has increasingly been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933644/microsoft-android-apps-windows-10-app-mirroring-report&quot;&gt;embracing Android as the mobile equivalent of Windows&lt;/a&gt;, because of the many restrictions with iOS and Apple’s App Store policies. This Android investment has led Microsoft to partner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20895328/microsoft-surface-duo-google-play-services-apps-android-browser-mobile&quot;&gt;more closely with Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20756647/microsoft-samsung-android-apps-partnership-galaxy-note-10-unpacked-event&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and launch apps like Your Phone for Windows 10 that is barely functional when paired with an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;msI7Mi&quot;&gt;Apple is now doubling down on defending its App Store policies, but there’s a growing number of companies that are calling for change. Spotify led the pack with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe&quot;&gt;antitrust complaint last year&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294230/epic-games-match-group-spotify-eu-apple-app-store&quot;&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294230/epic-games-match-group-spotify-eu-apple-app-store&quot;&gt;Match Group&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and others are making their feelings known. These calls will likely grow louder as the EU continues its investigations, but if there’s anything we know about Apple’s battles with European regulators it’s that it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49724786&quot;&gt;not afraid to fight back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wirecard CEO exits as search for missing billions hits dead end in Asia</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wirecard-accounts/wirecard-ceo-quits-as-search-for-missing-billions-hits-dead-end-in-asia-idUSKBN23Q0YA</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT/MANILA (Reuters) - Wirecard’s chief executive quit on Friday as the German payments firm’s search for $2.1 billion of missing cash hit a dead end in the Philippines and it scrambled to secure a financial lifeline from its banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markus Braun, who built Wirecard into one of the hottest financial technology investments in Europe before questions over accounting saw it crash in value, leaves the firm facing a looming cash crunch and mired in allegations of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braun resigned just hours after releasing a video blaming Wirecard’s problems on fraud, saying he accepted “responsibility for all business transactions lies with the CEO.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard, which has seen nearly 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) wiped off its market value in just two days, had been a welcome technology success story in Germany, a country better known for its prowess in heavy industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has been under scrutiny since a whistleblower alleged that it owed its success in part to a web of sham transactions, a scandal that some fear will now damage Germany’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard said in a statement that James Freis, a former compliance officer at Germany’s stock exchange, had been appointed as the firm’s interim CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is holding emergency talks with banks to secure a financial lifeline, three people with knowledge of the matter said, after its auditor, EY, would not sign off on its accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Wirecard warned that loans of roughly 2 billion euros ($2.24 billion) could be terminated if its annual report is not published on Friday and it has until evening to strike a deal with the banks, the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard’s share price dropped by as much as 50% on Friday in a continuation of Thursday’s rout, with the stock hitting 20 euros, a far cry from the 200 euros it was priced at when it joined Germany’s prestigious blue-chip Dax index in late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

REUTERS/Michael Dalder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wirecard is a company that has caused serious damage to the credibility and trust of the Dax with international investors. This will have significant consequences for the image of the German capital market,” Carola Rinker, a German economist specialising in accountancy fraud, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard’s shares tanked again on Friday after two Philippine banks, BPI and BDO, said it was not a client of theirs and alleged that documents had been falsified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘SPURIOUS’ DOCUMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braun, who has aggressively defended Wirecard against allegations of accounting fraud, had earlier said that the firm could itself have been the victim, without giving details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Attempts by Wirecard to appear as the victim in the missing 1.9 billion euros have been undone within hours of Wirecard management’s video yesterday evening,” said Neil Campling at Mirabaud, the only analyst to have a price target of zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EY had regularly approved Wirecard’s accounts in recent years, and its refusal to sign off for 2019 confirms failings found in an external probe by KPMG in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Wirecard did not give any details of where the missing money is alleged to have gone, statements by the two Philippine banks denying any involvement spooked investors in the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The document claiming the existence of a Wirecard account with BDO is a falsified document and carries forged signatures of bank officers,” BDO said, adding that it had reported the matter to the Philippines’ central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BPI also said Wirecard was not a client, adding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their external auditor presented to us a document that claimed that they are a client. We have determined that the document is spurious. We continue to investigate this matter,” BPI said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wirecard scandal, which was extensively investigated by the Financial Times newspaper and has been the subject of several reports by so-called short sellers, has also damaged the standing of German financial regulator Bafin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bafin looked on for far too long,” Fabio De Masi, a German lawmaker said, adding that the agency must be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie was the brainchild of Eric Tabach, an actor and YouTuber from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and filmmaker Christian Nilsson, from New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theatres in March, the pair saw an opportunity in the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given no big films were being released in cinemas, they wondered if they could hit the top of the charts if they made their own movie, DIY style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I noticed that the box office figures were absurd; $9,000, $15,000 for each movie. Nothing big was coming out. Blockbuster films were on hold. I wanted to find a way to get the biggest number,&quot; Mr Tabach told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cunning plan, befitting of the silver screen itself, was devised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach the top of the box office, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson realised they had to game the system. They did so by exploiting a loophole in cinema ticket sales, known as four-walling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Four-walling is when distributors rent out a movie theatre and buy all the seats,&quot; Mr Tabach, who used to work at BuzzFeed making viral videos, explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So they pay a flat fee to the theatre, and any money they make off seats goes straight into their pockets. The moment we realised that was an option of distribution, we went for it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Hollywood essentially mothballed during the pandemic, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson knew their movie had a solid chance of raking in the biggest one-day revenue total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With little more than a concept and a can-do attitude, the pair set to work on making the movie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;

The movie is about five YouTubers who join an online video-call and find themselves haunted and hunted by a mysterious internet troll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tabach enlisted the help of his friends to star in the movie. To his surprise, he managed to sign up some prestigious actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie's protagonist, the killer, was played by Charlie Tahan, best known as Wyatt Langmore in Netflix series Ozark. The co-star, Michelle Khare, has been cast in a soon-to-be-released series on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two well-known YouTubers, Yes Theory's Thomas Brag and Zach Kornfeld, part of comedy group The Try Guys, also featured in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Actor Sean Penn says he hopes cinema will get &quot;a little more inventive” after coronavirus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were really excited to be a part of something,&quot; said Mr Tabach, who himself appeared in the film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was at a point in the quarantine when everyone was really bored. Absolutely nothing was going on. Everyone wanted to be a part of this fun project, for free.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shot the movie over five days in May, only using Zoom to capture footage. Mr Nilsson then edited the footage and asked a friend to compose a score. Within weeks, it was cinema-ready. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They decided to screen the movie at an independent theatre in Westhampton Beach, outside New York City, where Mr Nilsson used to work. To rent the theatre, they were required to pay a small fee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, &quot;we made a slight loss&quot; on the movie, Mr Tabach said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of the screening, the pair went to town, as pictures posted to Facebook show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson were the only two viewers in attendance
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in tuxedos, with their hair neatly swept back, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson stood proudly outside the theatre. Above their heads, the theatre's hoarding bore the title of their movie. Unsubscribe, it read, above the words &quot;sold out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had bought every ticket, of course, but it did not matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We showed up, got some popcorn, sat down and played it. I've never seen an empty movie theatre, not least one playing a film I was in and made. It was a really cool experience. I watched every screening, over and over again,&quot; Mr Tabach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tabach watched the movie five times in total, lapping up every minute of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the revenue results were in, the next task was to convince IMDb, the owner of Box Office Mojo, their movie was legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They kept rejecting us, saying there was no proof,&quot; Mr Tabach said. &quot;So we sent them pictures of the actors, but they kept on doubting the entire thing. When media outlets started reporting about the film, it was eventually approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now it's officially number one on IMDb, which is crazy. It was number one for 10 June.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie in second place, The Wretched, was screened in 99 cinemas, earning $22,566 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsubscribe may only prove to be a one-off hit, an obscure trivia question on a pub quiz, perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Tabach said the film, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/ondemand/unsubscribefilm&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;which can be viewed on streaming platform Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;, represents more than a box-office ruse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No matter what, you can always find creative ways to get something done. Even in difficult circumstances. It was cool to see all these people stuck at home come together and make a project,&quot; he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>Apple gave me the Hey treatment back in 2014</title>
<link>https://ylukem.com/blog/apple-gave-me-the-hey-treatment-back-in-2014</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ylukem.com/blog/apple-gave-me-the-hey-treatment-back-in-2014</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;light&quot;&gt;June 18, 2020 ☼ &lt;a class=&quot;light&quot; href=&quot;https://ylukem.com/tagged/writing&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading the news this week about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hey, Apple, and in app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Many people have &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;takes&lt;/a&gt; on the situation, and I can’t help but feel déjà vu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;8.6033898305085&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wow. I'm literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY's ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We're told that unless we comply, they'll REMOVE THE APP.&lt;/p&gt;
— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the Hey situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hey submits their app, which is a paid service, to the App Store. There is no way to sign up for Hey from the app since Hey doesn’t want to give Apple 30% of all transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple approves version 1.0 of the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hey submits a bug fix update and is rejected because they do not offer a way for users to sign up with in app purchases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the same thing happened to my former company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/restocks-the-freak-in-me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Restocks&lt;/a&gt;. Restocks was a subscription-based shopping app for streetwear. We offered subscriptions to the service on our website using Stripe, and a companion app on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;releasing-restocks-1.0&quot;&gt;Releasing Restocks 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blot.im/cdn/blog_73772325166d4d768fb0996358b914dd/_image_cache/43bf1e73-828d-4103-80ef-e014ab685fdc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple’s approval email&quot; width=&quot;1018&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 1.0 approval email&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July of 2014, I submitted Restocks 1.0 to the App Store. The title of the app on the App Store was &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Restocks (for existing members only)”. Apple approved the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way to sign up in the app. When you downloaded the app, the only thing you saw was a log-in form. All marketing happened outside of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bug-and-the-shakedown&quot;&gt;The bug, and the shakedown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later, in October, I botched an update. Push notifications were now broken. I quickly identified the problem and submitted a new build to the App Store. Since App Review at the time took up to 7 days, I applied for and was granted an expedited review request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blot.im/cdn/blog_73772325166d4d768fb0996358b914dd/_image_cache/840a4ee0-8c94-44f6-8721-fb559cee7d16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request for an expedited review&quot; width=&quot;1884&quot; height=&quot;850&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;My granted request for an expedited review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may have been my mistake. A couple of hours later, Apple sends me an email saying they have &lt;em&gt;feedback&lt;/em&gt; for my App submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blot.im/cdn/blog_73772325166d4d768fb0996358b914dd/_image_cache/6a72166b-26db-46d7-b137-94344de21c2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple’s “feedback” for me&quot; width=&quot;1718&quot; height=&quot;1066&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;feedback” notification email&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the regular rejection email that Apple sends. This may have been because of the expedited review, but I wonder if it means that our review got escalated to a different team internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can’t show you what Apple said to me, because Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/42320913&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;purges&lt;/em&gt; old &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Resolution Center” communications&lt;/a&gt;. But here’s my memory of what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple rejected my app for not implementing their In App Purchase APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I pointed out to Apple that I didn’t allow users to sign up via the iPhone, only on the website — the name of the app even included &lt;span class=&quot;pull-double&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;(for existing members only)”!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple replied that they didn’t care, because there needed to be a way for people to sign up in the app, since the app was useless without signing in. We had to implement In App Purchases to get the update approved and to ensure the current version of the app was not removed from the App Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-next&quot;&gt;What happened next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious thing happened next. I wasn’t prepared to fight against Apple. So, I capitulated and feverishly spent all night implementing in app purchases. There wasn’t much of a choice — remember that this began with trying to fix a critical bug in the app, and users were unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only surprising thing to me about this Hey controversy is that someone is finally calling out Apple for something they’ve been doing for years. I hope it changes soon.&lt;/p&gt;
