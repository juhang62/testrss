<description>&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself wrestling with CSS layout, it’s likely you’re making decisions for browsers they should be making themselves. Through a series of simple, &lt;a href=&quot;https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/composition&quot;&gt;composable&lt;/a&gt; layouts, &lt;strong&gt;Every Layout&lt;/strong&gt; will teach you how to better harness the built-in algorithms that power browsers and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing algorithmic layout design means doing away with &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; breakpoints, &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/&quot;&gt;“magic numbers”&lt;/a&gt;, and other hacks, to create context-independent layout components.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rowhammer exploit that lets unprivileged attackers corrupt or change data stored in vulnerable memory chips has evolved over the past four years to take on a range of malicious capabilities, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/cutting-edge-hack-gives-super-user-status-by-exploiting-dram-weakness/&quot;&gt;elevating system rights and breaking out of security sandboxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/using-rowhammer-bitflips-to-root-android-phones-is-now-a-thing/&quot;&gt;rooting Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/new-attack-steals-private-crypto-keys-by-corrupting-data-in-computer-memory/&quot;&gt;taking control of supposedly impregnable virtual machines&lt;/a&gt;. Now, researchers are unveiling a new attack that uses Rowhammer to extract cryptographic keys or other secrets stored in vulnerable DRAM modules.&lt;/p&gt;

Like the previous Rowhammer-based attacks, the new data-pilfering RAMBleed technique exploits the ever-shrinking dimensions of DRAM chips that store data a computer needs to carry out various tasks. Rowhammer attacks work by rapidly accessing—or hammering—physical rows inside vulnerable chips in ways that cause bits in neighboring rows to flip, meaning 1s turn to 0s and vice versa. The attacks work because as capacitors become closer together, they more quickly leak the electrical charges that store the bits. At one time, these bit flips were little more than an exotic crashing phenomenon that was known to be triggered only by cosmic rays. But when induced with surgical precision, as researchers have demonstrated over the past four years, Rowhammer can have potentially serious effects on the security of the devices that use the vulnerable chips.
&lt;h2&gt;A new side channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed takes Rowhammer in a new direction. Rather than using bit flips to alter sensitive data, the new technique exploits the hardware bug to extract sensitive data stored in memory regions that are off-limits to attackers. The attacks require only that the exploit hammers memory locations the exploit code already has permission to access. What's more, the data extraction can work even when DRAM protected by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory&quot;&gt;error correcting code&lt;/a&gt; detects and reverses a malicious bit flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides opening a previously unknown &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack&quot;&gt;side channel&lt;/a&gt; that allows attackers to deduce sensitive data, the attack also introduces new ways unprivileged exploit code can cause cryptographic keys or other secret data to load into the select DRAM rows that are susceptible to extraction. By combining the memory massaging techniques with this new side-channel attack, the researchers—from the University of Michigan, Graz University of Technology, and the University of Adelaide and Data61—were able to extract an RSA 2048-bit signing key from an OpenSSH server using only user-level permissions. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rambleed.com/&quot;&gt;research paper published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research mostly considers Rowhammer as a threat to data integrity, allowing an unprivileged attacker to modify data without accessing it. With RAMBleed, however, we show that Rowhammer effects also have implications on data confidentiality, allowing an unprivileged attacker to leverage Rowhammer-induced bit flips in order to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the value of neighboring bits. Furthermore, as not every bit in DRAM can be flipped via Rowhammer, we also present novel memory massaging techniques that aim to locate and subsequently exploit Rowhammer flippable bits. This enables the attacker to read otherwise inaccessible information such as secret key bits. Finally, as our techniques only require the attacker to allocate and deallocate memory and to measure instruction timings, RAMBleed allows an unprivileged attacker to read secret data using the default configuration of many systems (e.g., Ubuntu Linux), without requiring any special configurations (e.g., access to pagemap, huge pages, or memory deduplication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While RAMBleed represents a new threat that hardware and software engineers will be forced to protect against, it seems unlikely that exploits will be carried out in real-world attacks any time soon. That's because, like most other Rowhammer-based attacks, RAMBleed requires a fair amount of overhead and at least some luck. For determined attackers in the field today, there may be more reliable attacks that achieve the same purpose. While ordinary users shouldn't panic, RAMBleed and the previous attacks it builds on poses a longer-term threat, especially for users of low-cost commodity hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key extraction requires that attackers first locate flippable bits in the memory of a targeted computer. This phase required the researchers to spend 34 hours to locate the 84,000 bit flips required to extract the SSH key. The non-trivial investment of time and resources required to template the memory is partly offset by the fact that it can be carried out ahead of time, with only user permissions, and without the need to interact with the SSH app or its secrets or with any other targeted application or its secrets. After the researchers filtered out bits that were useless in extracting the key, they ended up with about 4,200 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed then uses a special memory massing technique to cause the SSH key to load into memory locations that have the potential to expose their contents. The goal was to achieve a layout similar to the one shown in the left figure below, which correspond to the 8KiB pages needed for two Rowhammer variations. The first uses double-sided accesses and the second single-sided accesses. While RAMBleed works best in the double-sided version, due to noise from other system activity, the memory configuration sometimes results in a single sided-case (right version in the below figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/page-layout.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;292&quot; data-width=&quot;1748&quot; alt=&quot;Page layout for extracting a victim's secret. Each cell represents a 4 KiB page, meaning that each row represents an 8 KiB row in a DRAM bank. The attacker repeatedly accesses her row activation pages A0 and A2, activating the top and bottom rows. She then extracts corresponding bits in page S by observing bit flips in the sampling page A1.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/page-layout-640x107.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;107&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/page-layout-1280x214.png 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Page layout for extracting a victim's secret. Each cell represents a 4 KiB page, meaning that each row represents an 8 KiB row in a DRAM bank. The attacker repeatedly accesses her row activation pages A0 and A2, activating the top and bottom rows. She then extracts corresponding bits in page S by observing bit flips in the sampling page A1.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/page-layout.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;292&quot; data-width=&quot;1748&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; Page layout for extracting a victim's secret. Each cell represents a 4 KiB page, meaning that each row represents an 8 KiB row in a DRAM bank. The attacker repeatedly accesses her row activation pages A0 and A2, activating the top and bottom rows. She then extracts corresponding bits in page S by observing bit flips in the sampling page A1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Kwong et al.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in place, RAMBleed hammers the A0 and A2 activation pages shown in the figure. The attack was able to recover 68 percent of the targeted SSH key, or about 4,200 key bits, at a rate of 0.31 bit per second, and with an accuracy rate of 82%. In an email, Andrew Kwong, one of the University of Michigan researchers who wrote the paper, explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes us almost four hours to complete the reading phase. We actually don't need the key to remain in memory for any long period of time; OpenSSH will allocate a new page containing the key every time the attacker makes an SSH connection to the victim. If we make two connections in parallel, there are then two copies of the key in memory, which we then use for hammering and to read a single bit. We then close those SSH connections, so that there are no copies of the key in memory. We repeat this process to read each bit. Thus, the key is only in memory for ~3 seconds at a time, and we can force the victim to bring the key back into memory by making an SSH connection. We carried out our attack on an Ubuntu installation with default settings, without any special configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran the recovered bits through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/510.pdf&quot;&gt;Heninger-Shacham algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the recovery of RSA keys from partial information. The result: the researchers were able to achieve complete key recovery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rowhammer-enabled side-channel exploits a physical phenomenon in DRAM chips wherein the likelihood of bit flips depends on the values of bits immediately above and below it. That is, bits tend to flip to the same value of the bits in adjacent rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The main observation behind RAMBleed is that bit flips depend not only on the bit's &lt;em&gt;orientation&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., whether it flips from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1, but also on the values of neighboring bits,&quot; the researchers reported in their paper. &quot;Specifically, true bits tend to flip from 1 to 0 when the bits above and below them are 0, but not when the bits above and below them are 1. Similarly, anti bits tend to flip from 0 to 1 when the bits above and below them are 1, but not when the bits above and below them are 0.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed works by hammering the activation memory rows (A0 and A2 in the figure displayed above) of carefully arranged memory contents. The resulting bit flips allow the researchers to deduce the values of the secret bits. Repeating this procedure with bit flips at various offsets in the page allows the researchers to recover enough bits to construct the full key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ECC is not an absolute defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said RAMBleed is able to bypass ECC, or error-correcting code protections, built into some types of DRAM chips. When corrections occur, they happen in a predictable way that first corrects the error and then passes the corrected value to the software. This opens a timing side channel that allows the researchers to determine if a single-bit error occurred. The researchers then adjusted RAMBleed to account for ECC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With ECC, we cannot observe the flips directly,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;Instead we use the timing side channel and look for long read latencies. As such latencies occur only due to Rowhammer-induced flips, they can be used to reveal the value of the secret bit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed was able to successfully read bits stored in ECC memory with a 73% accuracy at a rate of 0.64 bit per second.&lt;/p&gt;

The key recovery made possible by RAMBleed is fundamentally different from a Rowhammer technique unveiled two years ago that allowed one virtual machine to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/new-attack-steals-private-crypto-keys-by-corrupting-data-in-computer-memory/&quot;&gt;compromise the RSA keys stored on a second VM&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2016 attack, the researchers used Rowhammer-induced bit flips to make the public key much weaker than it was before. The researches then factored the key to obtain the corresponding private key. RAMBleed, by contrast, reads the key from memory.
&lt;p&gt;In an advisory, officials with Intel confirmed that the vulnerability, a part of which is tracked as &lt;a href=&quot;http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0174&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-0174&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;may allow partial information disclosure via local access.&quot; The advisory assigned a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N&quot;&gt;Common Vulnerability Scoring System&lt;/a&gt; of 3.8 to the vulnerability out of a maximum of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Partial physical address information potentially disclosed through exploitation of this vulnerability does not contain user secrets, but could potentially be utilized to enhance unrelated attack methods,&quot; the advisory stated. It went on to recommend people follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/security-best-practices-side-channel-resistance&quot;&gt;established practices for side-channel resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/guidelines-mitigating-timing-side-channels-against-cryptographic-implementations&quot;&gt;mitigations for timing side channels&lt;/a&gt; against cryptographic implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement also advises using DRAM that's resistant to Rowhammer attacks. That generally includes using DDR4 chips that offer ECC or a feature known as targeted row refresh. This advice is helpful, but it's not the last word for two reasons. First, RAMBleed can bypass ECC protections. Second targeted row refresh isn't an automatic defense against Rowhammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;TRR makes it more difficult to find bit flips,&quot; Kwong, the University of Michigan researcher, wrote in an email. &quot;Not all DDR4 has TRR enabled, and implementations vary substantially by vendor, so it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how much safer TRR is against Rowhammer. TRR's susceptibility to RAMBleed is an open research question.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwong also offered a clarification to Intel's statement that CVE-2019-0174 &quot;may allow partial information disclosure via local access.&quot; Because the CVE tracks only the technique for uncovering the low 21 bits of a physical address, the statement is referring only to that, not the overall RAMBleed effect, the researcher told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Oracle published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/researchers-use-rowhammer-bitflips-to-steal-2048-bit-crypto-key/&quot;&gt;advisory here&lt;/a&gt; that reported that older and current servers using its SPARC and x86 CPUs aren't expected to be susceptible to RAMBleed. CPUs using DDR4 DIMMs have implemented target row refresh against RowHammer, the advisory said, while older systems with DDR3 make use of a combination of &quot;other RowHammer mitigations (e.g., pseudo-TRR and increased DIMM refresh rates in addition to Error-Correcting Code (ECC)).&quot; Oracle cloud services are also not expected to be vulnerable because they use the same DDR4 protections mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, the immediate real-world threat that RAMBleed—and most other Rowhammer attacks, for that matter—poses to most end users is relatively low. That's because attackers have a variety of less complicated and more tested methods that arguably could achieve most of the same results. That said, Rowhammer-based attacks including RAMBleed could in the years to come become a more serious risk, particularly in lower-cost devices if engineers don't study the underlying bug and devise effective means for fixing, or at least mitigating, it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By uncovering another channel for Rowhammer based exploitation,&quot; the researchers wrote, &quot;we have highlighted the need to further explore and understand the complete capabilities of Rowhammer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated to add details from Oracle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Australia’s surprising disregard for free speech</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/15/australias-surprising-disregard-for-free-speech</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/15/australias-surprising-disregard-for-free-speech</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;OR A GROWING&lt;/small&gt; number of Australians, it is like stumbling out of bed and not recognising, let alone liking, the face you see in the bathroom mirror. In early June federal police raided the Sydney headquarters of the state broadcaster, the &lt;small&gt;ABC&lt;/small&gt;. It had aired allegations of appalling deeds by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, including the killing of unarmed men and children. You might think the &lt;small&gt;ABC&lt;/small&gt; was doing the country a service by revealing such gross misconduct. The Australian Defence Force itself had become concerned about a “drift in values” among elite troops in Afghanistan. Yet the warrant against the &lt;small&gt;ABC&lt;/small&gt; read as if it was straight out of an authoritarian rulebook. Among other things it allowed investigators to “add, copy, delete or alter” material in the broadcaster’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye-rubbing is not just over press freedom, but about Australia’s direction as a liberal democracy. The whistleblower over the Afghanistan allegations was formerly a lawyer with the defence department. David McBride had followed public-interest disclosure rules by raising his concerns with his department. Only when he concluded that they were being ignored did he take his material to journalists. Far from being protected as a whistleblower, he is charged with the disclosure of unauthorised documents and faces a life sentence. His allegations, which have to do with events more than six years ago, have no obvious national-security implications today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor is this an isolated case. The day before the &lt;small&gt;ABC&lt;/small&gt; raid, police separately raided the home of a journalist at the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, one of Australia’s bestselling papers, in connection with a story about secret plans to expand the state’s surveillance powers to include snooping on people’s e-mails, text messages and bank accounts. Last year a former spy, known as Witness &lt;small&gt;K&lt;/small&gt;, and his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, were charged for (years ago) exposing Australia’s bugging of the government of Timor-Leste during sensitive negotiations over rights to offshore oil and gas. Meanwhile, a former employee at Australia’s tax office, Richard Boyle, faces 66 charges and no fewer than 161 years in jail for exposing its allegedly aggressive debt-collection techniques. When Mr Boyle reported such practices internally he himself became the subject of an investigation. Only after he refused to sign a gag order in return for compensation did he make his claims public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All democracies face a tension between civil liberties on the one hand and national security and confidentiality within government on the other. The tensions have grown along with the threat of Islamist extremism. In Australia the establishment feels another profound insecurity, too: the insidious influence of an authoritarian China in commerce, society, academia and even politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the balance Australia has struck between freedom and security looks skewed. Since 9/11 the government has passed more than 60 pieces of legislation that impinge on civil liberties (including one, last year, that obliges social-media firms to find ways for spooks to access encrypted communications). That is more than either America or Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more, America’s first amendment and related laws protect journalists from police who want them to disclose their sources. Britain acknowledges the guarantees of free speech in the European Convention on Human Rights. Australia is almost alone among established democracies in lacking explicit constitutional protection for civil liberties. Its feeble whistleblower laws pointedly exclude protection for public servants—even in cases that have nothing to do with national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the opposition Labor party’s attempts to make hay out of the government’s discomfort, it has long been an enthusiastic backer of security legislation. Indeed, few Australians challenge the overweening state. Could their self-image as authority-averse larrikins be wide of the mark? Could it be that Australia’s rugged individualists are happy to defer to nanny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr McBride, whose trial is due to start in a couple of weeks (and whose obstetrician father is credited with exposing the side-effects of thalidomide, a drug for morning sickness that caused babies to be born with deformed limbs), says the government is using the security apparatus “to fight its own people now”. He feels he has a duty to point this out: “I’ve never felt better. I’ve never liked myself more. I’ve never had a doubt it was the right thing to do for Australia.” Mr McBride, for one, is not afraid to look in the mirror. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;◼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People Met in Hotel Lobbies (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;Posted on May 24, 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the pleasures of digging through old newspapers is the way you occasionally stumble across something that illustrates just how foreign a country the past really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; ran a regular column under the charmingly Victorian title “People Met in Hotel Lobbies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4235&quot; src=&quot;https://jasonlefkowitz.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/people-met-e1495634684803.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;People Met in Hotel Lobbies&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;528&quot; height=&quot;125&quot; srcset=&quot;https://jasonlefkowitz.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/people-met-e1495634684803.png 528w, https://jasonlefkowitz.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/people-met-e1495634684803-300x71.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or “Heard in Hotel Lobbies,” or “Men in Hotel Lobbies,” or just “In Hotel Lobbies.” The title floated around a bit over the years. But you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the column was pretty simple. Back then, before travel became a thing that the unwashed masses did on a regular basis, coming and going through hotel lobbies was the sort of thing that marked a person out as someone of significance, as a Man of Affairs. So the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; had reporters whose job was simply to hang out in the lobbies of the city’s fashionable hotels, interviewing anybody who happened to walk by, on the theory that if you were the sort of person who would be walking through a hotel lobby your opinions were probably worth recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that theory right? Having read through a fair few of these columns, I can report to you, Dear Reader, that it was not. This was before two World Wars made Washington the capital of the free world, and the people who pass through “In Hotel Lobbies” are for the most part dreary bores pursuing the sorts of business one would pursue in the provincial capital of a provincial nation: businessmen seeking adjustments to this law or that tariff, boosters of development projects trying to drum up backing for their latest scheme, local political nabobs come to kiss their party leaders’ rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; dross, though. Digging through the archives, every now and then you stumble across a story that jumps out at you. Some feature confident predictions that we in the far future know will turn out to be spectacularly right (or spectacularly wrong); others say more about their subject than either the reporter or interviewee realizes; others are simply warm, relatable human interest stories. Taken together, they provide a fascinating portrait of Washington life in the long, slow sunset of the Gilded Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been able to review them all — the column ran for many years, and at its height was a daily feature, so there simply hasn’t been enough time. I wanted to give you a sample, though, so I’ve read through the “In Hotel Lobbies” columns published in 1889 and 1890 and picked out a few to highlight here. (If you’d like to read more, ask your local library if they have access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proquest.com/products-services/pq-hist-news.html&quot;&gt;ProQuest’s &lt;em&gt;Historical Newspapers&lt;/em&gt; database&lt;/a&gt;, which includes all issues of the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; published between 1877 and 2000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 28, 1889&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicago tailor A.M. Denny wants you to understand that American-made clothes are &lt;em&gt;every bit as good&lt;/em&gt; as those made in England, thank you very G-D much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After all there is nothing superior to American-made clothing,” said Mr. A. M. Denny, a Chicago merchant tailor, as he sat in one corner of the Ebbitt House lobby and watched the busy throng of politicians. Mr. Denny has just returned from abroad and it was but natural for him to investigate the clothing trade and make comparisons during his absence. “We Americans not only make better and cheaper clothing, but our styles are more graceful and comfortable. It used to be thought that a certain class of Americans thought they were not properly dressed unless they had English-made garments, but they are fast getting over that idea. The English, too, are coming to our ideas of cutting and making. Quite frequently in London I would see signs which read: ‘American-made clothing here,’ or ‘The latest American fashions in clothing.’ This would indicate that our styles are becoming popular abroad. And why shouldn’t they? We employ the best workmen and offer every inducement to our designers, and in the ready-made line it would seem that we are ages ahead of our English cousins. I am not trying to make a tariff argument out of these comparisons, but rather attribute our superiority to American genius and business tact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 29, 1889:&lt;/strong&gt; M.L. Parvin, “a bright mulatto” of New Orleans, argues a way forward for African-Americans that would be echoed in Booker T. Washington’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_compromise&quot;&gt;Atlanta Compromise&lt;/a&gt;” six years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do I think of the proposed national movement for the protection of the rights of the colored people?” repeated Mr. M. L. Parvin, a bright mulatto who is a prominent man among his race at New Orleans. “I hardly know what to say, as I have not given the plan that attention I should have done. However, I am not a great believer in these race movements. If there is a wrong being done American citizens, and I think all will admit that such is the case with our people in some sections, the remedy should be provided in some general measure. What I mean is that it should not be framed especially to meet the cases of the colored people. Such laws only lumber up our statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take the civil rights law, for instance. It is almost useless for any man to institute proceedings under it. People look on it as a ‘nigger’ law, and I really believe it has been a detriment to our race. It was no doubt well intended, but its effect has been far from satisfactory. After all, the only thing that will secure our rights is healthy public sentiment. The American people have a strong sense of right and wrong, and if there is to be an organization of any kind I am in favor of using it in that direction. Let us demonstrate that we are entitled to be placed on an equal footing with our fellow-citizens, and then I will have no fears as to the result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Colonel Dowly is a telegraph genius and labored upon the construction of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad&quot;&gt;Union Pacific&lt;/a&gt; telegraph line west from Omaha in ’69. “The greatest difficulty we encountered,” says the colonel, “was from the buffalos. They used the poles for scratching posts, and rallied from all parts of the bare plain to these — what they regarded — Godsends of comfort. A young Yankee with us invented a sharp brad-awl about three inches long to run into the poles with the points outward. It was thought sure that these ugly spikes would fend off the uneasy buffalo. It proved that the sharp points only made the sensation more grateful to the lordly bison, and down went every pole for fifty miles out of Omaha that night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maj. S. W. Rathbun, of the Marion (Iowa) &lt;em&gt;Register&lt;/em&gt;, is in Washington. He is a six-foot figure in Iowa Republican politics, and knows Iowa men and measures from the river front to the Nebraska line. “Prohibition,” said he, “has produced mixed results. It works in small towns and rural districts, but there is more or less open sale in the large towns, and in the cities on the river the saloons are open and undisguised. When there is any effort to suppress the saloons the ‘boot-legs’ and ‘holes-in-the-wall’ do a big business. It would have strengthened the Republican party if the last legislature had adopted a local option law. A majority of the Republican party is in favor of prohibition, or thinks it is, but a very strong and determined minority is in favor of a return to the law which permitted the sale of beers and light wines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am here,” said Ira S. Barnett, of Louisville, last night at Willard’s, “with some ten others in connection with the cracker industry. We have been in conference to-day, talking matters over and giving our experiences. The object chiefly is to put better goods on the market without asking any increase in the prevailing prices. In the South we have succeeded, and understand each other thoroughly. I don’t know as there is much in what we are doing to interest the public, except the price of the article, and, as I said before, that will remain unchanged.” Mr. Barnett is much pleased with the city, and intends to make a good inspection of it before taking his departure for home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical Virginian — six feet three and slender, with a long hickory stick and the beautiful blue and gold badge of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Confederate_Veterans&quot;&gt;Winchester Camp, No. 4&lt;/a&gt; — was in the lobby of the Metropolitan last night. He wore a full beard and his trousers were tucked into his boots. He was Col. J. L. Vandiver, of Millwood, Va., on his way home from the Richmond unveiling. He took from his coat a pocketbook and a diary torn by a minnie bullet. “They helped save my life,” said he. “I was trying to saber a Yankee soldier, who fired at me point blank. His bullet passed through my arm, these books, and a hunting-case watch and broke two ribs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At seventeen I was a member of the company which formed the guard at John Brown’s execution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he opened his diary and read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 21. ’65 — With fifty-seven men from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNeill%27s_Rangers&quot;&gt;McNeill’s command&lt;/a&gt; and Company F, Rosser’s brigade, I rode from Staunton, Va., ninety miles to Cumberland, Md., and captured in their hotels &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Crook&quot;&gt;Gen. John B. Crook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Kelley&quot;&gt;General Kelly&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of 8,000 Federal troops. The roads were supposed to be picketed for six miles out. The next night we went into camp on the south fork of the south branch of the Potomac, seven miles above Moorfield, a march of forty-two miles. The next night we camped at Harrison, thirty-two miles. The next day we arrived at Staunton and reported to Gen. Jubal A. Early. On the 25th I turned my prisoners over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Thunder_(prison)&quot;&gt;Castle Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, at Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we surrendered,” continued Colonel Vandiver, “I didn’t. I broke through and joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_E._Johnston&quot;&gt;Johnston&lt;/a&gt;. I never surrendered, and am a rebel still. I have six bullet wounds and a scar on my head from a piece of a shell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are sections of the South where a Federal election law might be cordially welcomed even by the dominant and Democratic whites simply on the ground that it would save them labor and expense and would not affect the result. Mr. Charles A. Gordon, of Port Gibson, Miss., is at Willard’s. He is a son of President Gordon, of the Port Gibson national bank, and though young is an alderman in that thriving town, and president of the local Democratic club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Federal election law cannot change results with us,” said he. “In our district the negroes outnumber the whites five to one, but we poll 1,800 votes and they only poll about 100. The reason is that they are indifferent and tired of voting and prefer to remain at home and tend to their crops. Nothing could induce them to go to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. G. C. Tharp, of Brtton, S.D., was at the Metropolitan the other day; so was his friend, L. G. Johnson, who likewise hails from the new State. Mr. Tharp is a Republican; Mr. Johnson a Democrat. They occupied communicating rooms, and when a reporter sent up his card to Mr. Tharp, in the latter’s absence Mr. Johnson told the bell-boy to “show him up.” Then the rollicking Mr. Johnson proceeded, by impersonating Mr. Tharp, to enjoy the novelty of having himself interviewed. He told the reporter that the Republicans in South Dakota were “all broke up;” that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_S._Gifford&quot;&gt;Mr. Gifford&lt;/a&gt; would be renominated, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pickler&quot;&gt;Mr. Pickler&lt;/a&gt; would have a hard time of it, and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_Alliance&quot;&gt;the Farmers’ Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, in all probability, would sweep the State. All this was very funny in print to Mr. Johnson, but not so amusing to Mr. Tharp, whose acquaintances at home were amazed at his seeming change of front politically.

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Gov. West, of Salt Lake City, Utah’s chief official during the Cleveland administration, described the status in the country of the Latter Day Saints to THE POST reporter at the Ebbitt last night. “There are only two parties in Utah,” he said, “Mormon and anti-Mormon. The antis are rapidly getting in the ascendant all over the Territory. In Salt Lake we have entire control of the municipal offices and all but two of the county offices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act&quot;&gt;The Edmunds-Tucker law&lt;/a&gt; was the death blow of polygamy. Since it was enacted the change that has come over the country has been marvelous. Under the new order an era of prosperity has set in; our cities have grown at a rapid rate, and the transforming touch of a better civilization has infused its spirit among the people. I don’t say, mind you, that polygamy is entirely broken up, but its votaries are so hemmed in by the law that the practice of it is carried on in the most secret way and under the most unfavorable circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A receiver is winding up the affairs of the Mormon Church as fast as it can be done. Of course a great deal of property was hidden away, or put out of reach, but I think that something like $1,000,000 will be realized. This will go to the public school fund, and the Mormon children, being the most numerous, will get the greatest benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hon. James A. Hamilton, of Jackson, Miss., ex-Senator and a leading lawyer of the Mississippi capital, when interrogated at the Riggs touching affairs in his section, said: “Great interest centers in the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Mississippi#1890_constitution&quot;&gt;our constitutional convention&lt;/a&gt;, now in session. I opposed the convention, for it was hard to see where any good could come of it. The fear of negro domination is the underlying motive of those who advocate it. I hold somewhat different views. The negro will never dominate the whites, even if numerically in the ascendancy. He is naturally docile, easily controlled, and as a laborer in our State is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate the blacks in our State politics seems the chief end of the constitution framers, but nearly every member has a different method of solving the question. Somebody has gone so far as to propose female suffrage, but that will hardly be adopted. An educational qualification for suffrage wouldn’t do because there are about 16,000 white illiterates in Mississippi. Besides, in a few years the negroes would all have learning enough to vote, so that this would only be a temporary expedient. A property qualification would disenfranchise hundreds of young white men in the towns and cities, who work in stores and at various trades, but possess no real estate. The subject is full of difficulties, but I think the two races can get along in amity with the fullest justice to every citizen. A national elections law would not mend matters, but tend rather to solidify the people strictly on race lines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Gessenhainer Loses His Hat at the Arlington.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressman Gessenhainer afforded a good deal of amusement for those who happened to be in the lobby of the Arlington last night about 8 o’clock because of the fact that when the doughty representative from the Third district of the Jersey State, after having partaken of a good dinner, searched for that very necessary covering for his noticeably shining bald pate — his hat — he found himself in the vocative. The hat, his new, shining, and glossy silk one, was not to be found, but in its place was left an old and battered straw one which would have done honor to that eccentric and certainly not dudish character in Dickens’ “Curiosity Shop,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilp&quot;&gt;Quilp&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Gessenhainer, to say the least, did not accept the matter in the light of a joke, but, on the contrary, very seriously. Little gleams of concentrated rage and animosity shot out from that usually calm and serene blue eye, for which the Jersey statesman is noted, and for a time it looked as though somebody was going to be visited with such an ebullition of spleen and venom as would have, had he been on his native heath, carried consternation and boundless terror throughout the length and breadth of that great and only cranberry State. He swelled and swelled, and stalked furiously up and down during the interim in which several bell boys, the hotel clerk, and the cigar clerk, were busily endeavoring to locate the missing part of the great statesman’s apparel. Everybody laughed, of course, (in their sleeves, however) because it was apparent that any audible manifestation of mirth would be the occasion for that gentleman to display, like our great John, his pugilistic powers. It was only a little while, however, before the great head was once more covered with a good and becoming chapeau, and his great legislative eminence stalked forth, clothed in his right mind again. Notwithstanding the brief period which elapsed before this necessary result was accomplished, the hand organ man was around and made the circumambient air resound with that popular refrain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Did_You_Get_That_Hat%3F&quot;&gt;“Where Did You Get that Hat?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 3, 1890:&lt;/strong&gt; The appearance of a foreigner in a Washington hotel lobby never goes without mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stout gentleman of fine appearance walked up to the clerk’s desk at the Ebbitt yesterday morning and asked if the “tram” would take him to Congress. His accent bespoke the Briton, and being a stranger he wanted to know if the street cars running by the door would bear him to the Capitol. He was Mr. W. F. Bishop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewers_of_Burton&quot;&gt;a wealthy brewer of Burton-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt;, who is taking in the sights of America for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am infatuated with this city,” he said. “It is beyond all comparison the most beautiful place I have ever seen, and I have done a good bit of traveling in my time. What I like best are your magnificent roads. They are not equaled in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I listened to a portion of the debate in the Senate yesterday, and was interested in it because such frequent allusion was made to England. I am a free-trader, but see no reason for alarm on the part of English manufacturers in the event &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Tariff&quot;&gt;the McKinley bill&lt;/a&gt; passes. There will always be a demand for British goods, but of course the time is coming when the United States will be our great rival in things that we have now but little competition to meet from this side of the Atlantic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man six feet high, straight as an arrow, jet black hair and piercing dark eyes, with rather a stern countenance that changes into an attractive one when he smiles, is Hon. Thomas B. Jones, of Montgomery, who was elected governor of Alabama the other day by over 90,000 majority. The governor-elect can certainly lay claim to being a very handsome man, and though his years are five-and-forty, he doesn’t look that old by half a decade. An interesting episode of his visit here was the meeting yesterday between him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Daniel&quot;&gt;Senator Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, of Virginia. The two were school boys together, and both served in the Confederate army, the Virginian on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubal_Early&quot;&gt;Early’s&lt;/a&gt; staff, his friend on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_Gordon&quot;&gt;Gordon’s&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Wilderness&quot;&gt;the battle of the Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; Daniel was shot down, severely wounded, and Jones helped to bear him from the field. Their meeting was for the first time since the stormy days of internecine strife, and it can well be imagined how pleased they were to look on each other again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I shall never forget,” said the governor, “one incident connected with a visit to Washington. I was a youngster attending school in Virginia, and on my way home for a vacation passed through the Capital for the express purpose of getting a glimpse of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan&quot;&gt;President Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;. Standing in the National Hotel I remarked to a friend that I hated to leave the city without seeing the President. An elderly gentleman, who was reading a paper near where we stood, looked up with a smile and remarked: ‘So you want to see the President, do you? Meet me here at 10 o’clock to-morrow and we will pay him a visit.’ It is needless to say I kept the engagement. The gentleman was on hand and we got into a carriage, but I didn’t know I was riding with the President of the United States till after we had reached the White House and I heard him addressed by his title. Then my modesty got the better of me and I wanted to retire, but the President kept me quite awhile, and I went away thoroughly happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Laura Jean Libbey, the author of “Miss Middleton’s Lover” and several other works of fiction equally remarkable, wrote her autograph on the Arlington register in a bold, round hand, and after it in parenthesis the word “novelist.” The young lady has a keen eye to business. Her productions have enjoyed a tremendous run among a certain class of readers, and have brought the fair author solace for unkind reviews in the shape of a steady stream of American coin. Miss Libbey lives in elegant style in New York, and her pen, if not polished, is prolific, as she is constantly engaged in the manufacture of romance, and if she keeps up the pace will yet get ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Wolfe_Hungerford&quot;&gt;“The Duchess”&lt;/a&gt; in the number of her books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S. M. Donald, real estate man, Buena Vista, Va., is at Willard’s. “We have the livest, most thrifty, and progressive young city in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah_Valley&quot;&gt;the Shenandoah Valley.&lt;/a&gt; In a year’s time — I am stating facts now — we’ve grown from 300 people to 3,000. The capital secured and invested in industries at Buena Vista aggregates $2,211,000, and the plants include pulp and paper mills, fire brick works, wagon and wire fence factories, planing mills, and woodworking shops, an electric light plant, and others, not to speak of eight miles of water mains. I think no town in the Old Dominion has more solid foundation for rapid growth than Buena Vista.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Representative Harry Libbey, of Virginia, leaned up against a pillow in the Ebbitt House and commented on the elections. Mr. Libbey still dabbles a little in politics, although he is far more interested in the success of the new line of steamboats between this city and Norfolk. One of these vessels is to be launched next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The time has passed,” said Mr. Libbey, “when the voters can be accurately counted before they vote. The American citizen is becoming more and more independent. He is his own master and he likes to vote as he thinks. There was a time when the party in power was supposed to have the inside track, because the office-holders could pull the wires. That day seems to have gone by. The power of the office-holder is decreasing, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system&quot;&gt;the dispensation of patronage&lt;/a&gt; is now a source of weakness instead of strength.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Only 37 dogs of each breed can have the same name</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;So... When we got a puppy we registered her with the AKC, because purebred and respectable breeder.

The AKC is a little like the old roller derby rule where two dogs of the same breed can't have the same name. Except instead of one dog, it's thirty-seven.

Thirty-seven, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A real-time journey through the first landing on the Moon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website replays the Apollo 11 mission as it happened, 50 years ago. It consists entirely of historical material, all timed to Ground Elapsed Time--the master mission clock. Footage of Mission Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken, and every word spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot; readability=&quot;36.712186689715&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon starting the application, select whether to begin one minute before launch, or click &quot;Now&quot; to drop in exactly 50 years ago, to-the-second during the anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to any moment of the mission using the time navigator at the top of the screen. The top bar is the entire mission with two bars below it providing magnification. Selecting transcript items, photos, commentary items, or guided tour moments, also jumps the mission time to the moment they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main mission audio consists of space-to-ground (left ear), capcom loop (right ear), and on-board recorder (center, when available). Selecting a Mission Control audio channel mutes the main audio, opens the Mission Control audio panel, and plays the &quot;live&quot; audio of that Mission Control position. Change channels by selecting the seats in mission control. Closing the Mission Control audio panel will unmute the main audio and continue mission playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 50 channels of Mission Control audio have only recently been digitized and restored, and are made publicly available here for the first time. They total over 11,000 hours in length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Space is not just going up and coming back down again. Space is getting into orbit and being there, living there, establishing a presence, a permanence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;29 April 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my final term at UWaterloo I took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs444/&quot;&gt;the CS444 compilers class&lt;/a&gt; with a project to write a compiler from a substantial subset of Java to x86, in teams of up to three people with a language of the group’s choice. This was a rare opportunity to compare implementations of large programs that all did the same thing, written by friends I knew were highly competent, and have a fairly pure opportunity to see what difference design and language choices could make. I gained a lot of useful insights from this. It’s rare to encounter such a controlled comparison of languages, it’s not perfect but it’s much better than most anecdotes people use as the basis for their opinions on programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did our compiler in Rust and my first comparison was with a team that used Haskell, which I expected to be much terser, but their compiler used similar amounts or more code for the same task. The same was true for a team that used OCaml. I then compared with a team that used C++, and as expected their compiler was around 30% larger largely due to headers and lack of sum types and pattern matching. The next comparison was my friend who did a compiler on her own in Python and used less than half the code we did because of the power of metaprogramming and dynamic types. A friend whose team used Scala also had a smaller compiler than us. The comparison that surprised me most though was with another team that also used Rust, but used 3 times the code that we did, because of different design decisions. In the end, the largest difference in the amount of code required was within the same language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go over why I think this is a good comparison, some information on each project, and I’ll explain some of the sources of the differences in compiler size. I’ll also talk about what I learned from each comparison. Feel free to use these links to skip ahead to what interests you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why I think this is insightful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#rust-baseline&quot;&gt;Rust (baseline)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#c&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;: 1.4x the size for mundane reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;: half the size because of fancy metaprogramming!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#rust-other-group&quot;&gt;Rust (other group)&lt;/a&gt;: 3x the size because of different design decisions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#scala&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;: 0.7x the size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/#ocaml&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;: 1.0-1.6x the size depending on how you count, similar to Haskell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-think-this-is-insightful&quot;&gt;Why I think this is insightful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you reply that amount of code (I compared both lines and bytes) is a terrible metric, I think that it can provide a good amount of insight in this case for a number of reasons. This is at least subjectively the most well controlled instance of different teams writing the same &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; program that I’ve ever heard of or read about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody (including me) knew I would ask this until after we were done, so nobody was trying to game the metric, everyone was just doing their best to finish the project quickly and correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone (with the exception of the Python project I’ll discuss later) was implementing a program with the sole goal of passing the same automated test suite by the same deadlines, so the results can’t be confounded much by some groups deciding to solve different/harder problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project was done over a period of months, with a team, and needed to be gradually extended and pass both known and unknown tests. This means that it was helpful to write clean understandable code and not hack everything together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than passing the course tests, the code wouldn’t be used for anything else, nobody would read it and being a compiler for a limited subset of Java to textual assembly it wouldn’t be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No libraries other than the standard library were allowed, and no parsing helpers even if they’re in the standard library. This means the comparison can’t be confounded by powerful compiler libraries not used by all teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were secret tests which we couldn’t see that were run once after the final submission deadline, which meant there was an incentive to write your own test code and make sure that your compiler was robust, correct and could handle tricky edge cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While everyone involved was a student, the teams I talk about are all composed of people I consider quite competent programmers. Everyone has at least 2 years of full time work experience doing internships, mostly at high end tech companies sometimes even working on compilers. Nearly all have been programming for 7-13 years and are enthusiasts who read a lot on the internet beyond their courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generated code wasn’t counted, but grammar files and code that generated code was counted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus I think the amount of code provides a decent approximation of how much effort each project took, and how much there would be to maintain if it was a longer term project. I think the smaller differences are also large enough to rule out extraordinary claims, like the ones I’ve read that say writing a compiler in Haskell takes less than half the code of C++ by virtue of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-baseline&quot;&gt;Rust (baseline)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and one of my teammates had each written over 10k lines of Rust before, and my other teammate had written maybe 500 lines of Rust for some hackathon projects. Our compiler was 6806 lines by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt;, 5900 source lines of code (not including blanks and comments), and 220kb by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wc -c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I discovered is that these measures were related by approximately the same factors in the other projects where I checked, with minor exceptions that I’ll note. For the rest of the post when I refer to lines or amount I mean by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt;, but this result means it doesn’t really matter (unless I note a difference) and you can convert with a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://thume.ca/2019/04/18/writing-a-compiler-in-rust/&quot;&gt;another post describing our design&lt;/a&gt;, which passed all the public and secret tests. It also included a few extra features that we did for fun and not to pass tests, that probably added around 400 extra lines. Also around 500 lines of our total was unit tests and a test harness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Haskell team was composed of two of my friends who’d written maybe a couple thousand lines of Haskell each before plus reading lots of online Haskell content, and a bunch more in other similar functional languages like OCaml and Lean. They had one other teammate who I didn’t know well but seems like a strong programmer and had used Haskell before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their compiler was 9750 lines by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt;, 357kb and 7777 SLOC. This team also had the only significant differences between measure ratios, with their compiler being 1.4x the lines, 1.3x the SLOC, and 1.6x the bytes. They didn’t implement any extra features but passed 100% of public and secret tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that including the tests is the least fair to this team since they were the most thorough with correctness, with 1600 lines of tests, they caught a few edge cases that our team did not, they just happened to not be edge cases that were tested by the course tests. So not counting tests on both sides (8.1kloc vs 6.3kloc) their compiler was only 1.3x the raw lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am inclined towards bytes as the more reasonable measure of amount of code here because the Haskell project has longer lines on average since it doesn’t have lots of lines dedicated to just a closing brace, and it’s one-liner function chains aren’t split onto a bunch of lines by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging into the difference in size with one of my friends on the team, we came up with the following to explain the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We used a hand-written lexer and recursive descent parsing, where they used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton&quot;&gt;NFA&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton&quot;&gt;DFA&lt;/a&gt; lexer generator, and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser&quot;&gt;LR parser&lt;/a&gt; and then a pass to turn the parse tree into an AST (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree&quot;&gt;Abstract Syntax Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a more convenient representation of the code). This took them substantially more code, 2677 lines compared to our 1705, for about an extra 1k lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They used a fancy generic AST type that transitioned to different type parameters as more information was added in each pass. This is and more helper functions for rewriting are probably why their AST code has about 500 lines more than our implementation where we build with struct literals and mutate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Option&amp;lt;_&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; fields to add information as passes progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have about 400 more lines of code in their code generation that are mostly attributable to more abstraction necessary to generate and combine code in a purely functional way where we just use mutation and string writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These differences plus the tests explain all of the difference in lines. In fact our files for middle passes like constant folding and scope resolution are very close to the same size. However that still leaves some difference in bytes because of longer average lines, which I’d guess is because they require more code to rewrite their whole tree at every pass where we just use a visitor with mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, I’d say setting aside design decisions Rust and Haskell are similarly expressive, with maybe a slight edge to Rust because of ability to easily use mutation when it’s convenient. It was also interesting to learn that my choice to use a recursive descent parser and hand-written lexer paid off, this was a risk since it wasn’t what the professor recommended and taught but I figured it would be easier and was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskell fans my object that this team probably didn’t use Haskell to its fullest potential and if they were better at Haskell they could have done the project with way less code. I believe that someone like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ekmett&quot;&gt;Edward Kmett&lt;/a&gt; could write the same compiler in substantially fewer lines of Haskell, in that my friend’s team didn’t use a lot of fancy super advanced abstractions, and weren’t allowed to use fancy combinator libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens&quot;&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;. However, this would come at a cost to how difficult it would be to understand the compiler. The people on the team are all experienced programmers, they knew that Haskell can do extremely fancy things but chose not to pursue them because they figured it would take more time to figure them out than they would save and make their code harder for the teammates who didn’t write it to understand. This seems like a real tradeoff to me and the claim I’ve seen of Haskell being magical for compilers devolves into something like “Haskell has an extremely high skill cap for writing compilers as long as you don’t care about maintainability by people who aren’t also extremely skilled in Haskell” which is less generally applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing to note is that at the start of every offering of the course the professor says that students can use any language that can run on the school servers, but issues a warning that teams using Haskell have the highest variance in mark of any language, with many teams using Haskell overestimating their ability and crashing and burning then getting a terrible mark, more than any other language, while some Haskell teams do quite well and get perfect like my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I talked to my friend who was on a team using C++, I only knew one person on this team, but C++ is used in multiple courses at UWaterloo so presumably everyone on the team had C++ experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their project was 8733 raw lines and 280kb not including test code but including around 500 lines of extra features. Making it 1.4x the size of our non-test code that also had around 500 lines of extra features. They passed 100% of public tests but only passed 90% of secret tests, presumably because they didn’t implement the fancy array vtables required by the spec, which take maybe 50-100 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t dig very deeply into these differences with my friend. I speculate that it’s mostly explained by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Them using an LR parser and tree rewriter instead of a recursive descent parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of sum types and pattern matching in C++, which we used extensively and were very helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing to duplicate all the signatures in header files, which Rust doesn’t have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we compared was compile times. On my laptop our compiler takes 9.7s for a clean debug build, 12.5s for clean release, and 3.5s for incremental debug. My friend didn’t have timings on hand for their C++ build (using parallel make) but said those sounded quite similar to his experience, with the caveat that they put the implementations of a bunch of small functions in header files to save the signature duplication at the cost of longer times (this is also why I can’t measure the pure header file line count overhead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;python&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one friend who is an extraordinarily good programmer who chose to do the project alone and in Python. She also implemented more extra features (for fun) than any other team including an SSA intermediate representation with register allocation and other optimizations. On the other hand because she was working alone and implementing a bunch of extra features, she dedicated the least effort to code quality, for example by throwing an undifferentiated exception for all errors (relying on backtraces for debugging) instead of having error types and messages like we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her compiler was 4581 raw lines and passed all public and secret tests. She also implemented way more extra features than any other team I compare with, but it’s hard to determine how extra code that took because many of her extra features were more powerful versions of simple things everyone needed to implement like constant folding and code generation. The extra features probably account for 1000-2000 lines at least though, so I’m confident her code was at least twice as expressive as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One large part of this difference is likely dynamic typing. Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ast.rs&lt;/code&gt; alone has 500 lines of type definitions, and there are many more types defined throughout our compiler. We also are always constrained in what we do by the type system. For example we need infrastructure for ergonomically adding new info to our AST as it progresses through passes and accessing that later. Whereas in Python you can just set new fields on your AST nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerful metaprogramming also explains part of the difference. For example although she used an LR parser instead of a recursive descent parser, in her case I think it needed less code, because instead of a tree rewriting pass, her LR grammar included Python code snippets to construct the AST, which the generator could turn into Python functions using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;. Part of the reason we didn’t use an LR parser is because constructing an AST without a tree rewriting pass would require a lot of ceremony (either generating Rust files or procedural macros) to tie the grammar to snippets of Rust code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of the power of metaprogramming and dynamic typing is that we have a 400 line file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;visit.rs&lt;/code&gt; that is mostly repetitive boilerplate code implementing a visitor on a bunch of AST structures. In Python this could be a short ~10 line function that recursively introspects on the fields of the AST node and visits them (using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__dict__&lt;/code&gt; attribute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of Rust and statically typed languages in general I’m inclined to point out that the type system is very helpful for avoiding bugs and for performance. Fancy metaprogramming can also make it more difficult to understand how code works. However, this comparison surprised me in that I hadn’t expected the difference in the amount of code to be quite so large. If the difference in general is really close to needing to write twice the amount of code, I still think Rust is worth the tradeoff, but 2x is nothing to sneeze at and in the future I’ll be more inclined to hack something together in Ruby/Python if I just need to get it done quickly without a team and then throw it away after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-other-group&quot;&gt;Rust (other group)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last comparison I did and also the most interesting to me was with my friend who did the project in Rust with one teammate (who I didn’t know). My friend had a good amount of Rust experience having contributed to the Rust compiler and done lots of reading, I don’t know about his teammate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their project was 17,211 raw lines, 15k source lines, and 637kb not including test code and generated code. It had no extra features and passed only 4/10 secret tests and 90% of the public code generation tests, because they didn’t find the time before the final deadline to implement fancier pieces of the spec. This is 3 times the size of our compiler written in the same language, but with strictly less functionality!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result was really surprising to me and dwarfed all the between-language differences I had investigated thus far. So we compared &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt; file size listings, as well as spot checking how we each implemented some specific things that had very different code sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to come down to consistently making different design decisions. For example, their front end (lexing, parsing, AST building) is 7597 raw lines to our 2164. They used a DFA-based lexer and LALR(1) parser, but the other groups did similar things without as much code. Looking at their weeder file, I noticed a number of different design decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They chose to use a fully typed parse tree instead of the standard string-based homogeneous parse tree. This presumably required a lot more type definitions and additional transformation code in the parsing stage or a more complex parser generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TryFrom&lt;/code&gt; trait implementations for converting between the parse tree types and the AST types while validating their correctness. This lead to tons of 10-20 line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;impl&lt;/code&gt; blocks. We used functions that returned &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; types to accomplish the same thing, which had less line overhead and also freed us from the type structure a bit more, making parameters and re-use easier. Some things that for us were single line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; branches were 10 line impl statements for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our types were structured in a way that required less copy-pasting. For example they used separate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is_abstract&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is_native&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is_static&lt;/code&gt; fields whose constraint checking code needed to be copy-pasted twice, once for their void-typed methods and once for their methods with a return type, with slight modifications. Whereas for us &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; was just a special type, and we came up with a taxonomy of modifiers into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;visibility&lt;/code&gt; enums that enforced the constraints at the type level and constraint errors were generated in the default case of the match statement that translated the modifier sets to the mode and visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t look at the code of the analysis passes of their compiler, but they are similarly large. I talked to my friend and it seems they didn’t implement anything like the visitor infrastructure that we did. I’m guessing this along with some other smaller design differences account for the size difference of this part. The visitor allowed our analysis passes to only pay attention to the parts of the AST they needed instead of having to pattern match down through the entire AST structure, saving a lot of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their code generation is 3594 lines where ours is 1560. I looked at their code for this and it seems that nearly all of the difference is that they chose to have an intermediate data structure for assembly instructions, where we just used string formatting to directly output assembly. This required defining types and output functions for all the instructions and operand types they used. It also meant that constructing assembly instructions took way more code, where we might have a formatting statement that used terse instructions like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mov ecx, [edx]&lt;/code&gt;, they needed a giant statement &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustfmt&lt;/code&gt; split over 6 lines which constructed the instruction with a bunch of intermediate nested types for the operands involving 6 levels of nested parentheses at its deepest. We could also output blocks of related instructions like a function preamble in one formatting statement, where they had to do the full construction for each instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team considered using such an abstraction. It would make it easier to have the option of either outputting textual assembly or directly emitting machine code, however that wasn’t a requirement of the course. The same thing could also be accomplished with less code and better performance using an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X86Writer&lt;/code&gt; trait with methods like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push(reg: Register)&lt;/code&gt;. Another angle we considered was that it might make debugging and testing easier, but we realized that looking at the generated textual assembly would actually be easier to read and test with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.rs/insta/0.8.1/insta/&quot;&gt;snapshot testing&lt;/a&gt; as long as we inserted comments liberally. But we (apparently correctly) predicted that it would take a lot of extra code, and there wasn’t any real benefit given what we knew we were going to need, so we didn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good comparison is with the intermediate representation the C++ group used as an extra feature, which only took them closer to 500 extra lines. They used a very simple structure (making for simple type definitions and construction code) that used operations close to what Java required. This meant that their IR was much smaller (and thus required less construction code) than the resulting assembly, since many language operations like calls and casts expanded into many assembly instructions. They also say it really helped debugging since it cut out a lot of the cruft and was easy to read. The higher level representation also allowed them to do some simple optimizations on their IR. The C++ team came up with a really nice design which got them much more benefit with much less code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it seems like the overall 3x size multiplier is due to consistently making different design decisions both large and small in the direction of larger code. They implemented a number of abstractions that we didn’t which added more code, and missed out on some of the abstractions we implemented which lead to less code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result really surprised me, I knew design decisions mattered but I wouldn’t have guessed beforehand that they would lead to any differences this large, given that I was only surveying people that I consider strong competent programmers. Of all the results from this comparison, this is the one I learned the most from. Something that I think helped was that I had read a lot about how to write compilers before I took the course, so I could take advantage of clever designs other people had come up with and found worked well like AST visitors and recursive descent parsing even when they weren’t taught in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing this really made me think about is the cost of abstraction. Abstractions may make things easier to extend in the future, or guard against certain types of errors, but they need to be considered against the fact that you may end up with 3 times the amount of code to understand and refactor, 3 times the amount of possible locations for bugs and less time left to spend on testing and further development. Our course was unlike the real world in that we knew exactly what we needed to implement and that we’d never touch the code afterwards, which eliminates the benefits of pre-emptive abstraction. However if you were going to challenge me to extend a compiler with an arbitrary feature you’d tell me later, and I had to pick which compiler I’d start from, I’d choose ours even setting aside familiarity. Because there’d simply be much less code that I’d need to understand how to change, and I could potentially choose a better abstraction for the requirements (like the C++ team’s IR) once I knew how I needed to extend things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also solidified the taxonomy in my head of abstractions that you expect to remove code given only your current requirements, like our visitor pattern, and abstractions you expect to add code given only your immediate requirements, but that may provide extensibility, debuggability or correctness benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talked to a friend of mine who did the project in a previous term using Scala, but the project and tests were the exact same ones. Their compiler was 4141 raw lines and ~160kb of code not counting tests. They passed 8/10 secret tests and 100% of public tests and didn’t implement any extra features. So comparing with our 5906 lines without extra features and tests, their compiler is 0.7x the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One design factor in their low line count was that they used a different approach to parsing. The course allowed you to use a command line LR table generator tool that the course provided, which this team used but no other team I mention did. This saved them having to implement an LR table generator. They also managed to avoid writing the LR grammar using a 150 line Python script which scraped a Java grammar web page they found online and translated it into the input format of the generator tool. They still needed to do some tree building in Scala but overall their parsing stage came in at 1073 lines to our 1443, where most other teams use of LR parsing lead to larger parsers than our recursive descent one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of their compiler was similarly smaller than ours though without any obvious large design differences, although I didn’t dig into the code. I suspect this is probably due to differences in expressiveness between Scala and Rust. Scala and Rust have similar functional programming features helpful for compilers, like pattern matching, but Scala’s managed memory saves on code required to make the Rust borrow checker happy. Scala also has more miscellaneous syntactic sugar than Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my team had all interned at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.janestreet.com/&quot;&gt;Jane Street&lt;/a&gt; the other language we considered using was OCaml, we decided on Rust but I was curious about how OCaml might have turned out so I talked to someone else I knew had interned at Jane Street and they indeed did their compiler in OCaml with two other former Jane Street interns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their compiler was 10914 raw lines and 377kb including a small amount of test code and no extra features. They passed 9/10 secret tests and all public tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other groups it looks like a lot of the size difference is due to them using an LR parser generator and tree rewriting for parsing, as well as a regex-&amp;gt;NFA-&amp;gt;DFA conversion pipeline for lexing. Their front-end (lexing+parsing+AST construction) is 5548 lines where ours is 2164, with similar ratios for bytes. They also used &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.janestreet.com/testing-with-expectations/&quot;&gt;expect tests&lt;/a&gt; for their parser where we used similar snapshot tests that put the expected output outside the code, so their parser tests were ~600 lines of that total where ours were ~200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves 5366 lines (461 lines of which is interface files with just type declarations) for the rest of their compiler and 4642 for ours, only 1.15x larger if you count interface files and basically the same size if you don’t count them. So it looks like setting aside our parsing design decisions, Rust and OCaml seem similarly expressive except that OCaml needs interface files and Rust doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I’m very glad I did this comparison, I learned a lot from it and was surprised many times. I think my overall takeaway is that design decisions make a much larger difference than the language, but the language matters insofar as it gives you the tools to implement different designs.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Soviet Arcade Games from the 70s and 80s</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently that here in the West we take our video game history largely for granted. Look back at the Golden Age of video games, and it’s apparent that we had it pretty good – a regular supply of new titles that pushed the technological boundaries were pumped out from America’s arcade manufacturers during the late 70s and early 80s – and we are fortunate enough to be able to play most titles via cheap and plentiful emulation, or indeed for those of us who choose to, using the original hardware. Aesthetically, the early arcade machines came with a pleasing design, including mostly glorious artwork and stylish cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about other parts of the world? What did our far off neighbours have in their arcades, if anything at all? To try to get some insight, I recently spoke with Daria Zvereva the curator at The Museum of Soviet Arcade Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;28418&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://arcadeblogger.com/2019/06/15/the-museum-of-soviet-arcade-games/logo/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;258,177&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tony T&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1560601788&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Logo&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg?w=258&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg?w=258&quot; class=&quot; wp-image-28418 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg?w=268&amp;amp;h=184&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot; width=&quot;268&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; srcset=&quot;https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg 258w, https://missilecommand.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/logo.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;h=88 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two locations in both Moscow and St Petersburg (opened in 2007 and 2013 respectively), the museum plays host to an wide collection of original video game and electromechanical machines, which not only showcase the uniqueness of Russian engineering and industrial design, but also reflect Soviet ideology of the time – their themes intended to provide practical skills (driving, shooting and aiming), rather than what might be regarded as more trivial pursuits like shooting down exotic invaders from space or saving stranded princesses from the clutches of oversized gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Approximately 250 machines are held within the collection, with just over 100 exhibited out on the floors of both locations. The remainder are in storage, awaiting restoration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After buying an entrance ticket, each visitor gets a fistful of original Soviet &lt;em&gt;15 kopek&lt;/em&gt; coins to operate the arcade machines (one kopek being one hundredth of a Ruble). Tours are provided every hour (in English if required), giving an insight to the history of arcade culture in the USSR. Other artefacts can be found dotted around including Soviet vending machines (stocked with classic drinks!), an old analogue photo booth (imported from the West) and even a vintage ping-pong table. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Daria how the museum started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Museum was founded by 3 friends who wanted to relive their childhood memories of playing these old Soviet arcade games once more. One of them recalled that when they were kids, there had been a very famous arcade machine called &lt;em&gt;Morskoi Boy&lt;/em&gt; (“Sea Battle”). They started doing some research and it turned out that even in 2006 in Moscow there were a lot of these old machines lying around. Of course, the majority of them were out of service, because no one built or maintained them any more. Starting with just three machines found in the old Amusement Park in Moscow, the collection has rapidly grown, into what it is today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of these components would come straight from military parts and spares
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In making these games available to the public, it became evident that there was genuine interest, as many visitors recall them being a significant part of Russian culture:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We find that even our young visitors can make comparisons between Soviet arcades and modern titles. They appreciate that these pioneering machines are a tangible part of our heritage. So it became clear to us that we have to preserve the Soviet arcades!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whilst the vast majority of machines on display were built and released in the mid 1980’s, production of arcade machines in the USSR actually begun a decade earlier. Several examples can be played: &lt;em&gt;Sniper&lt;/em&gt; arcade dated 1976 resides in the Moscow property; &lt;em&gt;Plane Rocker&lt;/em&gt; from 1977 is a kiddie ride also housed in Moscow, and the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Sea Battle&lt;/em&gt; arcade machine from 1978 is in Saint Petersburg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fascinating, was Daria’s explanation of how these machines came to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main producers of Soviet arcade machines were military factories, because they had funds and the skills to produce them, usually using leftover parts from real weapons, electronics and redundant pieces of industrial equipment. The view of the Government at the time was that the machines were very expensive: the cost of one arcade machine nearly equalled the cost of half of a Soviet car. The State decided not to create companies and factories specializing in the manufacture of arcade games. Therefore, mass production of arcade machines in the Soviet Union was never really established.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the sporadic production, it is difficult to establish exactly who produced each machine, and where they might have been built. The Soviet military factories of the time were classified, and to this day there is little or no mention of their names or locations. Usually, a machine may adorn nothing more than a serial number and a factory logo. With so little to go on, and next to no supporting documentation, the museum’s teams spend countless hours trying to establish a definitive history and lineage of the inventory they have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Approximately 90% of Soviet arcade machines were copies of western ones — shooters, foosball games, pinball and video cabinets. One very popular Soviet Basketball arcade machine is a straight copy of &lt;em&gt;Sega Basketball&lt;/em&gt;. And probably the most famous Soviet arcade game of all is called &lt;em&gt;Sea Battle&lt;/em&gt;, which was a copy of &lt;em&gt;Sea Devil&lt;/em&gt;, made by USA manufacturer Midway Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would be unfair to attribute all early Soviet arcade games as bootlegs of their Western counterparts. “Homegrown” Russian arcade machines do exist, and many are on display at the museum. Here’s a couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arcade machines were quite widespread in the USSR, but not as much as in the West. There was a distinct lack of any “gaming culture” in the USSR, coupled with an overwhelming sense among its citizens that arcade machines were something of a folly, and what little money was around should be spent on the practicalities of life under the Soviet regime rather than being squandered on playthings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It plays very much like Atari’s &lt;em&gt;Jet Fighter&lt;/em&gt; released in 1975
&lt;p&gt;Finding these machines is always a challenge (at least this is something we share over here in the West!). As Daria explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial core of the Museum’s collection was formed at the beginning of the Museum’s history. At the end of 2000s, we would go on fact-finding trips to many towns and villages in Russia and even former Soviet republics. We have found abandoned machines at the places where they were originally located during the Soviet era — in former pioneer camps, cinemas and abandoned amusement parks. Today our main source regarding new locations is from our visitors. It is they who very often tell us about abandoned arcade machines they have seen somewhere.

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Daria and his team is restoring and maintaining everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We try to restore the arcade machines by using original Soviet spare parts (which are usually obtained from other machines which could not be restored), that is why the restoration process (and ongoing maintenance) is quite problematic. Moreover, there are also other issues we struggle with; for example, the absence of technical documentation, which is essential, because many were bespoke built using individual designs. Also, the logical structure of electronic and electromechanical parts found in Soviet arcade machines is very different from what we have today. So, much of the equipment used is really hard to replace. Add to that, the lack of what I would call “vintage technical expertise” doesn’t help!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the very cool looking sit-down driver and pinball machine on the bottom row
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting, is the distinct industrial design of these machines. Each is very distinctive and very much of their origin. I&lt;span&gt;n the USSR gaming “industry” there were no designers as such – function was the order of the day – aesthetics took very much a back seat. The games were built at military factories, and very often the appearance of these machines was a result of engineering functionality perhaps with the help of a graphic designer here and there. The only guidance they would have had, would have been based on the surroundings in which they were manufactured. Of note is that fact that most machines are upright, floor-standing cabinets – a result of the requirement for the machines to be lined up against the walls of the factories in which they were built.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does the future hold for this fascinating place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From its humble start in 2007, the Museum has been entirely self-funded. Getting it recognised as a true museum with state support is extremely difficult. International exhibitions are impossible without this state assistance, so to see these machines does require a trip to one of the two locations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But recognition by some of Russia’s larger museums is much simpler — our Museum has already become a significant point on the attraction maps of both cities, so we are planning to just keep going do the things that are in our control, whilst keeping it fun along the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what to expect when you visit, here’s a great video giving a walk around of the museum in St Petersburg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCLfnhwPboI?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about both museums, including opening times and access details are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.15kop.ru/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Daria for talking with me and sharing these great pictures. If you visit one of the museums, be sure to say hello. I plan to get there sometime soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this week.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook lawyers explain to a judge that privacy on Facebook is nonexistent</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/facebook-privacy-policy-court/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/facebook-privacy-policy-court/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;In April 2018,&lt;/u&gt; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sat before members of both houses of Congress and told them his company respected the privacy of the roughly two billion people who use it. “Privacy” remained largely undefined throughout Zuckerberg’s televised flagellations, but he mentioned the concept more than two dozen times, including when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Senate’s Judiciary and Commerce committees, “We have a broader responsibility to protect people’s privacy even beyond” a consent decree from federal privacy regulators, and when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the House Energy and Commerce Committee, “We believe that everyone around the world deserves good privacy controls.” A year later, Zuckerberg claimed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/longform/facebook-zuckerberg-sandberg-interviews/&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt; and essays to have discovered the religion of personal privacy and vowed to rebuild the company in its image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only months after Zuckerberg first outlined his “privacy-focused vision for social networking” in a 3,000-word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the social network he founded, his lawyers were explaining to a California judge that privacy on Facebook is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courtroom debate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law360.com/articles/1164091/facebook-says-social-media-users-can-t-expect-privacy&quot;&gt;first reported by Law360&lt;/a&gt;, took place as Facebook tried to scuttle litigation from users upset that their personal data was shared without their knowledge with the consultancy Cambridge Analytica and later with advisers to Donald Trump’s campaign. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6153329-05-29-2019-Facebook-Inc-Consumer-Privacy.html&quot;&gt;The full transcript of the proceedings&lt;/a&gt; — which has been quoted from only briefly — reveal one of the most stunning examples of corporate doublespeak certainly in Facebook’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representing Facebook before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn &amp;amp; Crutcher, who claimed that the plaintiffs’ charges of privacy invasion were invalid because Facebook users have no expectation of privacy on Facebook. The simple act of using Facebook, Snyder claimed, negated any user’s expectation of privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no privacy interest, because by sharing with a hundred friends on a social media platform, which is an affirmative social act to publish, to disclose, to share ostensibly private information with a hundred people, you have just, under centuries of common law, under the judgment of Congress, under the SCA, negated any reasonable expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An outside party can’t violate what you yourself destroyed, Snyder seemed to suggest. Snyder was emphatic in his description of Facebook as a sort of privacy anti-matter, going so far as to claim that “the social act of broadcasting your private information to 100 people negates, as a matter of law, any reasonable expectation of privacy.” You’d be hard-pressed to come up with a more elegant, concise description of Facebook than “the social act of broadcasting your private information” to people. So not only is it Facebook’s legal position that you’re not entitled to any expectation of privacy, but it’s your fault that the expectation went poof the moment you started using the site (or at least once you connected with 100 Facebook “friends”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Chhabria was skeptical of Snyder’s privacy nonexistence argument at times, which he rejected as treating personal privacy as a binary, “like either you have a full expectation of privacy, or you have no expectation of privacy at all,” the judge put it at one point. Chhabria continued with a relatable hypothetical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I share [information] with ten people, that doesn’t eliminate my expectation of privacy. It might diminish it, but it doesn’t eliminate it. And if I share something with ten people on the understanding that the entity that is helping me share it will not further disseminate it to a thousand companies, I don’t understand why I don’t have — why that’s not a violation of my expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder responded with an incredible metaphor for how Facebook sees your use of its services — legally, at least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a hypothetical of my own. I go into a classroom and invite a hundred friends. This courtroom. I invite a hundred friends, I rent out the courtroom, and I have a party. And I disclose — And I disclose something private about myself to a hundred people, friends and colleagues. Those friends then rent out a 100,000-person arena, and they rebroadcast those to 100,000 people. I have no cause of action because by going to a hundred people and saying my private truths, I have negated any reasonable expectation of privacy, because the case law is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it is, in broad daylight: Using Facebook is a depressing party taking place in a courtroom, for some reason, that’s being simultaneously broadcasted to a 100,000-person arena on a sort of time delay. If you show up at the party, don’t be mad when your photo winds up on the Jumbotron. That is literally the company’s legal position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, Snyder blames the targets of surveillance capitalism for their own surveillance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why every parent says to their child, “Do not post it on Facebook if you don’t want to read about it tomorrow morning in the school newspaper,” or, as I tell my young associates if I were going to be giving them an orientation, “Do not put anything on social media that you don’t want to read in the Law Journal in the morning.” There is no expectation of privacy when you go on a social media platform, the purpose of which, when you are set to friends, is to share and communicate things with a large group of people, a hundred people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point Chhabria asked, seemingly unable to believe Snyder’s argument himself, “If Facebook promises not to disseminate anything that you send to your hundred friends, and Facebook breaks that promise and disseminates your photographs to a thousand corporations, that would not be a serious privacy invasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder didn’t blink: “Facebook does not consider that to be actionable, as a matter of law under California law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s counsel did seem to concede one possibility for the existence of privacy on Facebook: someone who uses Facebook completely contrary to the way it’s designed and to the way it has always been marketed. “If you really want to be private,” Snyder proposed to the court, “there are people who have archival Facebook pages that are like their own private mausoleum. It’s only set to [be visible by] me, and it’s for the purpose of repository, you know, of your private information, and no one will ever see that.” So these are your possible valid legal statuses as a Facebook user: You’re either plugged into the 100,0000-person perpetual surveillance Coachella or living in a digital “mausoleum.” But if you ever decide to fling open the doors of your private data crypt and, say, share a little content on Facebook with friends, as the company has been pushing us for the past 13 years, Snyder says you’re out of luck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you go to friends, the gig is over because you’ve just gone — taken a hundred people and pronounced your personal likes and dislikes. In fact, the very act of liking something and showing your friends that you like something is a non-private act. It’s the whole premise of Facebook and social media, is to render not private your likes, your dislikes, your expressions. When I tag someone in a photo, it’s to tell people, not keep private, that I’m sitting on a park bench with John Smith. So it’s the opposite of private when you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s stance that if one truly wants to keep something private, they should keep it far from Facebook is odd — odder, still, given the fact that the company publishes an extremely detailed privacy policy, perhaps only meant for those huddling in private mausoleums where such a principle still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook was built to bring people closer together,” reads the start of the company’s “Privacy Principles.” “We help you connect with friends and family, discover local events and find groups to join.” Not mentioned is that if you do any of that, it’s Facebook’s official opinion that you’ve “negated” your claim to any privacy whatsoever. The list of principles reads like a bad joke after studying Snyder’s courtroom theorizing: “We design privacy into our products from the outset” seems hard to reconcile with “Once you go to friends, the gig is over.” It’s similarly hard to take “We give you control of your privacy” seriously after hearing, through Snyder, that because Facebook users “shared the information … you’ve lost control over the information and its subsequent disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
