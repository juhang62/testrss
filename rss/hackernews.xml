<title>Real hardware breakthroughs, and focusing on rustc</title>

<description>&lt;h5&gt;By jackpot51 on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-11-27 21:00:00 -0700 -0700&quot; class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Wednesday, November 27, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System76 Galago Pro (galp3-c) running Redox OS. &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.redox-os.org/img/hardware/system76-galp3-c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the addition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/tree/master/nvmed&quot;&gt;NVMe driver a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt;, I have been running Redox OS permanently (from an install to disk) on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://system76.com/laptops/galago&quot;&gt;System76 Galago Pro (galp3-c)&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/system76/firmware-open&quot;&gt;System76 Open Firmware&lt;/a&gt; as well as the un-announced, in-development, GPLv3 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/system76/ec&quot;&gt;System76 EC firmware&lt;/a&gt; . This particular hardware has full support for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/tree/master/ps2d&quot;&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/tree/master/ps2d&quot;&gt;touchpad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/tree/master/nvmed&quot;&gt;storage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/tree/master/rtl8168d&quot;&gt;ethernet&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to use with Redox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular machine has had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/system76/status/1191768795846713344&quot;&gt;debugging port&lt;/a&gt; soldered on, using the unused CEC pin of the HDMI port as RX, and then a custom HDMI to USB serial cable for closed-chassis debug. Now I can get serial output from the board, using the Intel LPSS UART on the PCH, which is supported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/kernel/commit/90b113f0470b22d33ff088d2ec27a07b51e71d36&quot;&gt;this commit to the kernel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/kernel/commit/c27a6c149b918a50516876fcfdb103ee30c5137c&quot;&gt;an earlier commit fixing memory-mapped serial ports&lt;/a&gt;. This has allowed for easier debugging of the kernel and drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fairly satisfied with how things are going, and will continue to focus on running a permanently installed Redox system. My work on real hardware has improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers/commit/c7f02e5e2141c0dbf07bc82fd40ee7d6cad95229&quot;&gt;drivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redoxfs/commit/3191d7d18202d77b67fca6c437abe6d89d249a61&quot;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;, added &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbutils/commit/e2f940488e961dbbe54051c16d2006efbb7c9d9d&quot;&gt;HiDPI support&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbterm/commit/f851dca2938116e58da90a233e9c98edcc1374e2&quot;&gt;number of applications&lt;/a&gt;, and spawned the creation of new projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/pkgar&quot;&gt;pkgar&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/installer/commit/5762840f792c4bf1c6b0de18b3674e91830577e1&quot;&gt;install Redox from a live disk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also become easier than ever to cross-compile for Redox, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redoxer&quot;&gt;redoxer tool&lt;/a&gt; which can build, run, and test using commands similar to cargo. It automatically manages a Redox toolchain and can run executables and tests for Redox inside of a container on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a long-standing issue (&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; longstanding issue?) of Redox OS has been this: To allow the compilation of Rust binaries &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt; Redox OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts have been made in the past to address this issue. In 2017, Redox OS participated in the Google Summer of Code. Through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redox-os.org/news/gsoc-self-hosting-final/&quot;&gt;excellent work done by ids1024&lt;/a&gt;, Redox OS was able to get close to self-hosting. This work was then amplified by the creation of a C library written in Rust, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc&quot;&gt;relibc&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc/-/graphs/master&quot;&gt;over 40 contributors&lt;/a&gt; has led to significant POSIX C library compatibility, and a significant increase in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook/tree/master/recipes&quot;&gt;number of available packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was later done to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60547&quot;&gt;convert Redox OS to a different Rust target family&lt;/a&gt;, finally unifying Rust support for Redox OS with that of other Unixen. Finally, Redox specific support code could largely be eliminated from codebases. This led to a great number of Rust crates suddenly gaining Redox OS support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed that as though the dream of self-hosting would soon be reality. After many heartbreaking hours (days, weeks, months?) of compiling rustc, then finding some error requiring more work in relibc, I was finally able to compile a statically linked rustc - only to discover that rustc is no longer capable of running statically linked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then began work on relibc’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/redox-os/relibc/tree/master/src/ld_so&quot;&gt;ld.so&lt;/a&gt;, which provides dynamic linking support for executables. Tragically, the work to support dynamic linkage in Rust for Redox OS defaulted everything to dynamic linkage, which took some time to sort out properly. This is where work was halted on porting rustc to Redox OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Redox OS on Redox OS has always been one of the highest priorities of the project. Rustc seems to be only a few months of work away, after which I can begin to improve the system while running on it permanently, at least on one machine. With Redox OS being a microkernel, it is possible that even the driver level could be recompiled and respawned without downtime, making it incredibly fast to develop for. With this in place, I would work more efficiently on porting more software and tackling more hardware support issues, such as filling in the USB stack and adding graphics drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, more importantly than what I will be able to do, is the contributions by others that will be unlocked by having a fully self-hosted, microkernel Operating System written in Rust, Redox OS.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Voted to Sell .ORG</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.circleid.com/posts/20191127_why_i_voted_to_sell_org/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/images/member_photos/photo_8459.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; alt=&quot;Richard Barnes&quot; class=&quot;memPhoto&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Richard. I've been around the Internet for a while. I work for Cisco now, and used to lead security for Firefox. I've published a few RFCs and served on the Internet Engineering Steering Group (the board of the IETF). I was a co-founder of Let's Encrypt and I currently serve on its board. I care about the Internet, and I care about nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm also a member of the Board of the Internet Society, and in that role, I joined the board's unanimous decision to sell the Public Interest Registry (PIR), the registry for the .org top-level domain, to Ethos Capital. Since this transaction has gotten some attention, I'd like to speak a little about why, in my estimation, this deal is a good one for the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically comes down to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Internet Society does great work protecting the Internet and bringing it to the people who need it most — work that is way more impactful than leasing domain names. This transaction secures that work's future and independence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethos is a worthy successor to the Internet Society as the steward of .org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet is bigger than .org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that .org has a big impact on the online brand and identity of nonprofits. But the impact of the Internet Society is much broader than that. For those who might be unfamiliar with the Internet Society, our mission is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet Society supports and promotes the development of the Internet as a global technical infrastructure, a resource to enrich people's lives, and a force for good in society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our work aligns with our goals for the Internet to be open, globally-connected, secure, and trustworthy. We seek collaboration with all who share these goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, that's a much bigger project than just leasing domain names! Some highlights of our work include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more detail on what we have planned, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internetsociety.org/action-plan/2020/&quot;&gt;2020 Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transaction will put that bigger mission on a solid footing — so that the Internet Society can provide much more substantive help to nonprofits than merely leasing domain names, and with more continuity over time. While it's true that running .org provided a relatively steady income stream, it effectively staked most of our revenue on a single business, and required a certain amount of our resources to be spent managing that business, distracting from the broader mission. Especially as PIR has grown over time, this situation has become increasingly untenable. Establishing a more diverse portfolio of investments will allow us to have more predictable revenue over time, and to take a longer-range perspective when it comes to achieving our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.org is going to be fine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the current concerns about .org are premised on a presumption that prices will rise, based on a distrust of private equity and the affiliations of some of the investors. Those concerns are understandable, but I would encourage people to look at what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keypointsabout.org/&quot;&gt;Ethos themselves have said&lt;/a&gt; about their intentions with regard to .org, namely that they intend to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make .org domain names &quot;accessible and reasonably priced for all&quot;, including limiting price increases to no more than 10% per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep PIR accountable to the community through a Stewardship Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give back to the .org community through a Community Enablement Fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek certification as a B Corporation, as a commitment to transparency and social responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if we take Ethos at their word, they should be just as good a steward for .org as the Internet Society has been, with robust ties to the community and an explicit public-benefit orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the question of the wholesale price of a .org domain, the impact is likely to be very limited. Ethos has said that their plan is to &quot;live within the spirit of historic practice,&quot; that is, to manage prices roughly as PIR would have under the stewardship of the Internet Society. If they impose the maximum 10% price increase plan for ten years, the price will be around $26 per year — still quite affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the worst case, if Ethos considers dramatically increasing prices (which, to be clear, we do not expect them to do!), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/sites/default/files/tlds/org/org-agmt-html-30jun19-en.htm&quot;&gt;Registry Agreement for .org&lt;/a&gt; requires a 6-month notice period during which domain owners can lock in a 10-year registration at pre-increase rates. This should seriously discourage Ethos from doing this, because it would take 10 years for the new high rate to even take effect for existing registrants, and new registrations would likely fall off right away. So while there may not be an explicit prohibition on larger price increases, there is a strong commercial disincentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're all trying to make the Internet a better place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Internet Society is to support and promote the development of the whole Internet. Not the domain name industry, not just .org domain owners — everything. That's a big, complicated challenge. In making this decision, we considered what would be in the best interests of the Internet Society, .org domain holders, and the broader, global Internet. The Internet Society board did not take this decision lightly. We recognize that there is risk involved, and that we are asking the community to trust in our assessment of the risk. As I've outlined above, my assessment is that Ethos is a sufficiently trustworthy partner that the risks in handing over .org are limited, and offset by the potential to put a large pool of capital to work for the good of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this transaction completes, the Internet Society will be in a stronger position than ever to build, protect, and defend the Internet. To all the people who are learning about the Internet Society for the first time as a result of this transaction: Please stay in touch. With our increased resources, it will be more important than ever that we work together as a whole community. I look forward to working with all of you to make the Internet a resource to enrich people's lives, and a force for good in society.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why does the Librem 5 phone cost that much?</title>
<link>https://puri.sm/posts/breaking-ground/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://puri.sm/posts/breaking-ground/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are often asked, why does the Librem 5 cost that much? Well, there are several reasons and I will try to explain the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the design of the Librem 5 is unique in many ways. Most importantly the hardware is designed from the ground up by us and for us. The Librem 5 is a &lt;strong&gt;complete custom design, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; based on any reference design&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically designed with all the goals we all want to achieve – open, safe, secure, respecting your privacy and digital rights. This rules out existing mobile phone reference designs, like from MTK, Qualcomm and the others. When we first approached hardware manufacturers almost two years ago with this project most of them instantly said “No, sorry, impossible, we can not help you.”. Others warned us, that it could never work, that it was too complicated, “the industry does not do that” and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet here we are, later than we wanted, but &lt;strong&gt;we are actually shipping first hardware&lt;/strong&gt;! It is possible but it comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From-scratch Hardware Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made and makes the hardware design expensive are several things. First of all the lack of reference design. Most other phones (especially Android phones) are based more or less on &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; designs of the chipset, (i.e. from the CPU manufacturers). If you go with a, say, MTK-based design, then the hardware design is more like going shopping. You pick some peripheral hardware choices like display, cameras, storage and very few other things. Your differentiator compared to other MTK-based phones are these choices and the customization of the Android system–as far as you can customize it at all. The nice part is that you get pretty much everything from the chipset maker. The SDK (Software Development Kit) or BSP (Board Support Package) comes with all the drivers ready to go, but beware, many of them are binary-only mystery code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not have this luxury. We had to &lt;strong&gt;design the hardware from scratch&lt;/strong&gt; and we also have to &lt;strong&gt;develop many drivers ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;–everything that is not yet available as free software in upstream mainline Linux kernels. This also includes a lot of low level work we had to do for the support of the i.MX8M Quad CPU we chose. The i.MX8M was, at the time when we made this choice, still pretty young and mainlining its support in the Linux kernel had just begun. Some critical drivers were just barely starting to work, like the GPU support. Other mission critical things like power management, clock scaling (for the CPU, GPU and RAM) are just now starting to hit mainline and still need a lot of work. Peripherals like charge controller, accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer were only partially implemented. We had to work around bugs in the display controller of the i.MX8M to support the LCD and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Separated Chipsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current smartphone chipsets also make hardware design a lot easier since most of the critical components of a smartphone are already integrated into the main CPU, onto the single silicon die. This has lots of advantages but also a ton of problems concerning security and privacy. These integrated peripherals are sitting on the same silicon, tied tightly to the CPU. Complex parts like the cellular modem or the WiFi &lt;em&gt;can access the very same RAM&lt;/em&gt; that is used at runtime to store your most private data, but at the same time they are controlled by &lt;em&gt;binary-only firmware&lt;/em&gt; that no one except the manufacturer of that chip has access to. You &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to trust that this firmware does not contain any malicious code to eavesdrop or spy on you. Trust in closed non-auditable complex computer systems is something everyone has learned the hard way we should not have. The news is full each day of zero day bugs and exploits throughout the stack–from applications to operating systems and even down to the very silicon the whole stuff runs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we chose to separate the most critical parts from the CPU. The WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular modems are sitting on &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; M.2 cards, separated from the CPU by defined interfaces (SDIO and USB) and–a Purism signature feature–can be physically switched off by hardware kill switches. All of that makes the hardware design even more complicated, more parts, more components, more interfaces. But we are convinced this is the only way to be as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Groundbreaking Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This low level Linux kernel work and the hardware design work do not come for free. We started to research and develop this for the development kit in early 2017, the development kit started shipping in December 2018. We learned a lot from doing the dev kit and this experience is now going into the hardware design of the Librem 5 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were the first to announce, develop and deliver a Linux based mobile device development platform&lt;/strong&gt;. Funny fact, a few months after we made the dev kit public others announced development boards following the very same principles (separating CPU and baseband/radios), using very similar hardware design ideas (like the 18650 battery holder) and some more details–even our hardware kill switches found new friends 🙂 &lt;em&gt;We don’t mind this&lt;/em&gt;! We made this available, for free, to share, to study, to modify and to use for whatever others see fit. &lt;strong&gt;We made it available for the greater public good&lt;/strong&gt;, to foster ethical products that protect digital rights and don’t exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced we laid out a path and have been breaking ground, not only for the Librem 5 but also for other projects and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this of course is expensive. The hardware with its separated peripherals costs a lot more just in parts alone than a comparable smartphone. The hardware design effort took many person months of hard work, a lot more than an off-the-shelf smartphone design would have cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the software. I already talked about all the Linux kernel work we had to invest in, to support peripherals, to tune things and also in parts to–frankly speaking–do NXP’s job in developing free software support for their CPU. Especially in the beginning (early 2018 and into 2019), it was pretty tough, but I also have to point out that NXP has heard us and many others and has significantly ramped up their Linux mainlining efforts – thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not only the kernel and drivers that we had and have to invest in. We also chose not to use a platform like Android, we chose to base on a system and platform that is maintained by a huge open source community, that is openly governed and to which anyone can contribute. We chose to use the same operating system base as we use on the Purism Librem laptops (PureOS), which is a Debian derivative. For applications and the graphical user interface we chose the same pattern: open governance, free software and active community and thus based on the same environment we use on our Librem laptops – GNOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning people called us crazy for that choice&lt;/strong&gt;. It would be too much effort, there are alternatives (Plasma Mobile, Ubuntu Touch etc.) and that we would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; make it with GNOME. Well, here we are, we are shipping with GNOME / GTK+ and we achieved exactly what we wanted: &lt;strong&gt;convergence between the desktop / laptop and the phone&lt;/strong&gt;. Applications written for or modified with some care and not too much effort can now seamlessly run on the desktop and on smaller screens like the phone. This is simply amazing! And all of that with the same tools, the same programming environment and the same libraries and packages as on the desktop–truely write once and run everywhere (maybe having to recompile 🙂 ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convergence is a very unique feature now coming to PureOS. Quite a few have tried before us but did not get it this far. We created one of the first truly convergent environments: the same operating system base (Debian, deb packages), the same tools and SDK and the (pretty much) same applications for the desktop and the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we are breaking ground, paving the way for many more to follow. &lt;strong&gt;All of our code is public, all our changes to upstream projects go upstream as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. The GNOME project has for a long time been thinking about mobile applications but never came around. Purism is making this a reality now, together with the GNOME community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Only the Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This development comes at a high price. We have a team of about 15 developers full time working on this for almost &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily figure how much money we already put into this, and we are not done yet. The release of the Librem 5 is &lt;strong&gt;only the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;. We are committed to continue to develop the software and the hardware, this is not a single-shot project, this is breaking ground and making use of it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of the Librem 5 the story has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Raspberry Pi 4 WiFi stops working at 2560 x 1440 screen resolution</title>
<link>http://www.enricozini.org/blog/2019/himblick/raspberry-pi-4-loses-wifi-at-2560x1440-screen-resolution</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.enricozini.org/blog/2019/himblick/raspberry-pi-4-loses-wifi-at-2560x1440-screen-resolution</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series of post on the design and technical steps of creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enricozini.org/blog/2019/himblick&quot;&gt;Himblick&lt;/a&gt;, a digital signage box based on the Raspberry Pi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One full day of crazy debugging, and the result is that if the Raspberry Pi 4 outputs HDMI at a resolution of 2560x1440, the WiFi stops working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any lower resolution we tried, from 2048x1080 down, does not show this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not try any resolution above 2560x1440, for lack of a monitor that would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;One of the micro HDMI cables that we used&quot; src=&quot;https://www.enricozini.org/blog/2019/himblick/microhdmi.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reproduced this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;on both microHDMI outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with two different cables: one with a microHDMI to HDMI dongle adapter; one direct microHDMI to HDMI. The latter is the one I bought in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-store/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Store in Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; together with one of the Pi 4 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with three different RaspberryPi units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with 4 different power supplies: one rated at 2A, one rated at 3A, one rated at 3A bought in the Raspberry Pi shop in Cambridge, and a laptop USB-C charger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with stock Raspbian Buster Lite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with stock Raspbian Buster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;killing every process in the system, starting the network manually with &lt;code&gt;wpa_supplicant&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dhclient&lt;/code&gt;, and starting X manually with &lt;code&gt;sudo X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with two different SD cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connected to an AP some meters away, and connected to a phone hotspot next to the Raspberry PI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=247982#p1514642&quot;&gt;At the bottom of this forum thread&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;guestxyz&lt;/code&gt; dated Aug 07) someone mentioned screen resolution, which is what finally prompted us to try that. Thanks, &lt;code&gt;guestxyz&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After confirming what the trigger was that caused the problem and chatting about it on IRC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.olasd.eu/&quot;&gt;olasd&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=254640&quot;&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt; where more people are experiencing similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further things left to try after chatting about it on IRC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;whether disconnecting the HDMI cable from the Pi end (with X still started at high resolution and everything) make the WiFi work again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switching the monitor to another input while the Pi is at 2560x1440&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;letting the monitor go into power saving mode while the Pi is at 2560x1440&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrite_bead&quot;&gt;cable chokes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post seem to have become quite popular, so to be clear, the intention is to document the issue that we spent a whole day chasing so that others won't have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been fantastic to see how this has made the rounds and resulted in actual RF measurements being made, and better pinpointing of the issue than we could ever have achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly admire Raspberry Pi's work. Thanks to them we get to have an affordable standard platform with a wide use base, which over time gets extremely well known, and as such can be a very well mapped ground to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Great American Eye Exam Scam</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/great-american-eye-exam-scam/602482/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/great-american-eye-exam-scam/602482/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a beautiful summer day a few months ago, I walked down to the part of the Connecticut River that separates Vermont from New Hampshire, and rented a kayak. I pushed myself off the dock—and the next thing I remember is being underwater. Somehow, the kayak had capsized as it entered the river. I tried to swim up, toward the light, but found that my own boat blocked my way to safety. Doing my best not to panic, I swam down and away before finally coming up for air a few yards downriver. I clambered onto the dock, relieved to have found safety, but I was disturbed to find that the world was a blur. Could the adrenaline rush have been so strong that it had impaired my vision? No, the answer to the puzzle was far more trivial: I had been wearing glasses—glasses that were now rapidly sinking to the bottom of the Connecticut River.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the whole experience was, in retrospect, as funny as it was scary, the most annoying consequence was the need to regain the faculty of sight. I did not have any backup glasses or spare contact lenses on hand. The local optometrists did not have open slots for an eye exam. Since the United States requires patients to have a current doctor’s prescription to buy eyewear, I was stuck. In the end, I had to wear my flowery prescription sunglasses—in offices and libraries, inside restaurants and aboard planes—for several days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I went to Lima, Peru, to give a talk. There, I found a storefront optician, told a clerk my strength, and purchased a few months’ worth of contact lenses. Though my Spanish is rudimentary, the transaction took about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/optometrist/496907/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: I, doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ordeal led me to look into a fact that has puzzled me ever since I moved to the United States a dozen years ago. In every other country in which I’ve lived—Germany and Britain, France and Italy—it is far easier to buy glasses or contact lenses than it is here. In those countries, as in Peru, you can simply walk into an optician’s store and ask an employee to give you an eye test, likely free of charge. If you already know your strength, you can just tell them what you want. You can also buy contact lenses from the closest drugstore without having to talk to a single soul—no doctor’s prescription necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why does the United States require people who want to purchase something as simple as a curved piece of plastic to get a prescription, preceded by a costly medical exam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;The standard argument in favor of the American status quo is that impaired vision may point to serious health problems that a new pair of glasses will neither treat nor heal. Compelling Americans to see an optometrist helps to ensure that the largest possible number of cases of progressive eye diseases will be caught at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Barbara Horn, O.D., the president of the American Optometric Association (AOA), told me, “Today, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;2.2 billion people around the world have a vision impairment&lt;/a&gt;, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed … That’s why it’s clear to health experts, policymakers, the media, and the public that increased access to eye exams and eye doctors are needed to safeguard health and vision.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this argument rather begs the question. After all, the added cost of having to see an optometrist presumably stops many Americans from accessing the corrective lenses they need to improve their vision. Is the desirability of an eye exam performed by a medical professional a sufficient reason to prevent Americans who would rather not—or cannot—visit an optometrist from buying glasses and contacts? We can only answer this question by acknowledging a trade-off between competing goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, some number of Americans who visit an optometrist to get a new prescription will indeed discover that they have a serious condition that requires immediate care. On the other hand, it is likely that a much greater number keep wearing glasses that are too weak—or won’t wear glasses at all—because they want to avoid the cost, time, or stress of a visit to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been able to find any studies that credibly assess how this barrier affects Americans’ quality of life. But it’s reasonable to assume that it has an adverse impact on many people, especially underprivileged Americans—those who don’t have insurance, have little cash, or lack the social or financial capital to navigate our country’s byzantine medical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many thousands of Americans go through life seeing less well than they might because they don’t have an up-to-date prescription? How many students do poorly in school because they can’t read what’s written on the blackboard? And how many accidents are caused by drivers who can’t see the road as well as they should?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;One possible reason for such strict vision-wear rules is that many people have a financial interest in this burdensome system. If Americans no longer needed to book appointments with optometrists to buy glasses or contacts, many optometrists would see their salaries cut, and some might go out of business altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optometrists are also a source of revenue for opticians, from large chains like Specsavers to independent stores in malls and town centers across the United States. Since they often work on-site, they have an incentive to nudge their patients to buy the products on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/health-care-america-jobs/550079/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Health care just became the U.S.’s largest employer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I last went to an eye exam at a storefront optician in the United States, for example, the staff gave me the hard sell on glasses that would have cost hundreds of dollars, as well as on contact lenses that were much more expensive than identical ones sold by online retailers. Thankfully, I knew that two laws, one passed in 1997 and the other in 2003—which had, incidentally, been loudly opposed by the AOA—gave me the right to demand a copy of my prescription. I stood firm, and later went online to order perfectly fine glasses and contact lenses at a fraction of the price. But how many customers give in to heavy-handed sales tactics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is little wonder, then, that American optometrists spend a lot of money on lobbying. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2016&amp;amp;id=D000000194&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;the Center for Responsive Politics,&lt;/a&gt; for example, the AOA spent $1.8 million on lobbying and another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cmte=C00024968&amp;amp;cycle=2016&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;$1.4 million&lt;/a&gt; on campaign contributions in 2016. And although the AOA was unsuccessful in its attempt to block the laws requiring optometrists to give patients a copy of their prescription, any attempt to remove the need for frequent office visits (the exact figure depends on whether you wear glasses or contacts, among other factors) is likely to meet with stiff resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;Like the citizens of virtually every other country around the world, Americans should be allowed to buy any pair of glasses or set of contact lenses at a moment’s notice. While the requirement to get a medical exam from an optometrist who has spent a minimum of seven years in higher education may have good effects in some cases, it also creates unreasonable costs—and unjustifiable suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in times of extreme polarization and a deeply broken Congress, this is one piece of sensible legislation that should be able to command bipartisan support. Republicans who believe in the free market should look on this red tape as an unnecessary intrusion on free enterprise. Democrats who care about the well-being of the socioeconomically disadvantaged—and are worried about the health disparities between different ethnic groups—should be outraged by the unreasonable burden the situation places on underprivileged Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put Americans in charge of their own vision care, and abolish mandatory eye exams.&lt;/p&gt;
