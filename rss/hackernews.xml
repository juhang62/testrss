<title>Microsoft turned down facial-recognition sales on human rights concerns</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp recently rejected a California law enforcement agency’s request to install facial recognition technology in officers’ cars and body cameras due to human rights concerns, company President Brad Smith said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft concluded it would lead to innocent women and minorities being disproportionately held for questioning because the artificial intelligence has been trained on mostly white and male pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has more cases of mistaken identity with women and minorities, multiple research projects have found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anytime they pulled anyone over, they wanted to run a face scan” against a database of suspects, Smith said without naming the agency. After thinking through the uneven impact, “we said this technology is not your answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Stanford University conference on “human-centered artificial intelligence,” Smith said Microsoft had also declined a deal to install facial recognition on cameras blanketing the capital city of an unnamed country that the nonprofit Freedom House had deemed not free. Smith said it would have suppressed freedom of assembly there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Microsoft did agree to provide the technology to an American prison, after the company concluded that the environment would be limited and that it would improve safety inside the unnamed institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith explained the decisions as part of a commitment to human rights that he said was increasingly critical as rapid technological advances empower governments to conduct blanket surveillance, deploy autonomous weapons and take other steps that might prove impossible to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in December it would be open about shortcomings in its facial recognition and asked customers to be transparent about how they intended to use it, while stopping short of ruling out sales to police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith has called for greater regulation of facial recognition and other uses of artificial intelligence, and he warned Tuesday that without that, companies amassing the most data might win the race to develop the best AI in a “race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shared the stage with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who urged tech companies to refrain from building new tools without weighing their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please embody the human rights approach when you are developing technology,” said Bachelet, a former president of Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to name the prospective customers the company turned down.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Post-surgical deaths in Scotland drop by a third, attributed to a checklist</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Deaths after surgery in Scotland have dropped by more than a third, research suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study indicated a 37% decrease since 2008, which it attributed to the implementation of a safety checklist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19-item list - which was created by the World Health Organization - is supposed to encourage teamwork and communication during operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death rate fell to 0.46 per 100 procedures between 2000 and 2014, analysis of 6.8m operations showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Atul Gawande, who introduced the checklist and co-authored the study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, said: &quot;Scotland's health system is to be congratulated for a multi-year effort that has produced some of the largest population-wide reductions in surgical deaths ever documented.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director, added: &quot;This is a significant study which highlights the reduction in surgical mortality over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While there are a number of factors that have contributed to this, it is clear from the research that the introduction of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008 has played a key role.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why the Instagram founders really quit</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;bMyTkj&quot;&gt;Last year, in an effort to give shape to &lt;em&gt;The Interface&lt;/em&gt;’s coverage area, I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface&quot;&gt;a public list of questions&lt;/a&gt; that I hoped to investigate over time. I saved my favorite one for last: why did Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger really leave Instagram?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yuIf3v&quot;&gt;In the months since the co-founders abruptly quit, we’ve gotten more details about the split. We learned that increasing tension with Facebook, combined with an unusually long post-acquisition tenure at their acquirer, had made them antsy. But we still never knew what &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; led them to resign, or why it was announced in such a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ag7mcN&quot;&gt;Today, with the publication of Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-fresh-hell/&quot;&gt;12,000-word account of Facebook’s past year and a half&lt;/a&gt;, I am happy to say that the mystery is now solved. Drawing on interviews with 65 current and former employees, the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; authors paint a detailed picture of the steps leading to Systrom and Krieger’s departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ju8WIv&quot;&gt;According to their reporting, the timeline goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;cyngX0&quot;&gt;Instagram’s rapid rise bred resentment at Facebook, where some top executives came to feel that the acquisition was siphoning growth and engagement away from the core Facebook app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;77kFJI&quot;&gt;As Mark Zuckerberg prepared to reorganize his executive team for the first time ever, the Instagram founders pushed for then-News Feed chief Adam Mosseri to be their official delegate from the mothership. They liked him and thought he could be an effective buffer against intrusive Facebook demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;zsAHDE&quot;&gt;After Systrom participated in magazine profiles, Zuckerberg declared that no one else could do so without permission from him or Sheryl Sandberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;ysRy2o&quot;&gt;In an earnings call in July 2018, Zuckerberg took credit for Instagram’s success, saying “We believe Insta­gram has been able to use Facebook’s infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;lwZ9vO&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg then charged his then-head of growth, Javier Olivan, to make a list of all the ways Facebook boosted Instagram’s growth. Some of those supports included a tag on Instagram photos shared to Facebook noting where they had originally been posted, and allowing Instagram to use a person’s Facebook friends to suggest Instagram follows for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;HoS5jy&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg then told Systrom he was taking away all those supports, apparently to protect the health of the Facebook app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;5O8tED&quot;&gt;Systrom sent a memo to Instagram employees informing them that Zuckerberg was taking away the growth tools, saying he opposed them but the company had no choice but go along. Facebook was terrified the memo would leak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;QVsBji&quot;&gt;Systrom then immediately peaced out for a few months of paternity leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;C43xAI&quot;&gt;With Systrom on leave, Facebook began testing location tracking and a disgusting hamburger button inside Instagram, offending Systrom’s delicate sensibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;Wz2WeJ&quot;&gt;Systrom began to suspect that Zuckerberg was intent on making him miserable enough that he would quit. (See: hamburger button.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;VUvlI7&quot;&gt;Systrom and Krieger decided to quit soon after the former came back from paternity leave. After they informed their team that they intended to leave, the news leaked to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, blindsiding the communications team and forcing Facebook to rush up a hurried goodbye. (The rush job was one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/kevin-systrom-very-nearly-tells-the-truth-139677&quot;&gt;the main lingering mysteries about the departure&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;UrjnGc&quot;&gt;I find all of this ... highly plausible? It’s also somewhat tragic: as the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story notes, Instagram’s design has made it harder for bad actors to misuse it, and it retains an appeal for North American users that the core Facebook app has long since squandered. You can debate how much Facebook contributed to Instagram’s success — and surely it contributed &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; — but Systrom and Krieger had unshakeable beliefs about app design that served them very well, and now that they’re gone all that is left is for Instagram to become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17903556/instagram-founders-quit-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-facebook&quot;&gt;a reskinned version of the Facebook app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fntm5e&quot;&gt;As for the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; piece, it could serve as a nice introduction to Facebook’s past year and a half for anyone who hasn’t been following along with &lt;em&gt;The Interface&lt;/em&gt;. The authors gamely try to weave a thread through Cambridge Analytica, the challenges of content moderation, executive departures, the future of the news industry, Joel Kaplan’s malign influence, fights among the communications team, Zuckerberg’s comments about the Holocaust, last fall’s data breach, the Definers scandal, the Facebook Research app scandal, and the creeping threat of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Likjbb&quot;&gt;My main takeaway is that an app that has 2.7 billion users is going to have a lot of things happening inside it, and to it, and that it might make a good subject for a daily newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ra4Ztb&quot;&gt;In any case, I am glad that a core mystery about Facebook’s past year and a half can now officially be said to be closed. Facebook surely runs smoother now that recalcitrant product leaders like Systrom and Krieger (and WhatsApp’s Jan Koum and Brian Acton) have left the company. Whether it runs better, though, is still an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;WConoY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YvPKmf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-fight-rivals-help-friends-n994706?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of leaked Facebook documents show Mark Zuckerberg as ‘master of leverage’ in plan to trade user data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lonY1X&quot;&gt;Olivia Solon and Cyrus Farivar report on a leak of more documents produced in discovery for the Pikini lawsuit that we’ve written about a few times around here. Main takeaway: Facebook considered selling user data more seriously than was previously known. (Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252461648/Facebook-takes-extraordinary-legal-steps-to-contain-document-leak?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;is also taking legal action against developer Six4Three&lt;/a&gt;, which it believes leaked the documents to reporters. It could result in jail time for the leakers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TQYZll&quot;&gt;Still, these freshly leaked documents show that the plans to sell access to user data were discussed for years and received support from Facebook’s most senior executives, including Zuckerberg, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox and VP of growth Javier Olivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;llikU8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-2020-plan-target-seniors-on-facebook-1555346862-b3bc5987-9e98-4837-9e55-aa479909ceb8.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=twsocialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s 2020 plan: Target seniors on Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KxUSGM&quot;&gt;If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. (On the other side of the aisle, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/tech/aoc-quit-facebook-just-like-me/index.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_content=2019-04-16T00%3A00%3A05&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twbusiness&amp;amp;utm_term=image&quot;&gt;just deactivated her personal account.)&lt;/a&gt; Sara Fischer reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GXFqOw&quot;&gt;The Trump campaign is spending nearly half (44%) of its Facebook ad budget to target users who are over 65 years old, as opposed to Democratic candidates who are only spending 27% of their budget on that demographic, according to data given to Axios exclusively from Bully Pulpit Interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Fdqxrg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410610/russia-internet-traffic-law-surveillance-parliament?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian lawmakers approve plan to take more control over internet traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wIZRkZ&quot;&gt;The Russian internet is rapidly becoming a mirror of China’s, Colin Lecher reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yZBF0r&quot;&gt;Under the proposal, Russian internet traffic would be required to be sent through servers in the country, according to the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, giving the country more leverage to surveil and censor information. The bill was approved by the State Duma, and it will now head to the upper legislative chamber before going to President Putin’s desk for a signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SLMrVq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-india-court/google-blocks-chinese-app-tiktok-in-india-after-court-order-idUSKCN1RS1HT?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google blocks Chinese app TikTok in India after court order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q43Jop&quot;&gt;I’m legitimately surprised that this happened to TikTok before larger platforms like YouTube. Does the Indian government want to strangle India in its crib? I’d also note that the ban stems from some rather vague concerns — you’d think the government would tie the ban to a high-profile incident rather than generic worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HaCnMO&quot;&gt;Google has blocked access to the hugely popular video app TikTok in India to comply with a state court’s directive to prohibit its downloads, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0enmFi&quot;&gt;The move comes hours after a court in southern Tamil Nadu state refused a request by China’s Bytedance Technology to suspend a ban on its TikTok app, putting its future in one of its key markets in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;pjKbg9&quot;&gt;Alex Kantrowitz reports on an unintended consequence of Twitter’s policy around removing tweets containing death threats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17.613365155131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6tnXGI&quot;&gt;Twitter would’ve typically taken down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments/1117202995962212352?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;threatening tweets&lt;/a&gt; once they were reported, but the company left them up to enable potential law enforcement collaboration, a source close to the company told BuzzFeed News. The Capitol Hill police are working on the issue, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ss8G4b&quot;&gt;The incident highlights Twitter’s flawed approach to dealing with death threats on its platform. Instead of reporting death threats to law enforcement as a policy, Twitter simply deletes them. This means its users can make these threats with little fear of retribution, since the tweets usually disappear before police can review them. “This creates incentives for users of the platform,” a Democratic congressional aide told BuzzFeed News. “There’s a reason people on this platform feel comfortable making open death threats to Ilhan Omar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;xoHIDJ&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey sat for an uncomfortable interview at TED on Tuesday. Among other things, he discussed a blog post the company put out today &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/health-update.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;noting some progress in fighting abuse on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;oqfc5O&quot;&gt;Emily Dreyfuss notes a dramatic moment at Dorsey’s TED interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yNPKUh&quot;&gt;In his signature black hoodie and jeans, unkempt facial hair and black beanie, he sat with head of TED Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers, who curates current affairs for the conference, for a conversation that left all three members, and the audience, frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lSexKL&quot;&gt;“We’re on this great voyage with you on the Twittanic,” Anderson told Dorsey after roughly 20 minutes of interrupted back and forth. “There are people in steerage who are saying, ‘We are worried about the iceberg ahead!’ And you say, ‘That is a good point’ and ‘our boat hasn’t been built to handle it,’ and we’re waiting, and you are showing this extraordinary calm and we’re all worried but we’re outside saying, ‘Jack, turn the fucking wheel!’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8yhZwf&quot;&gt;Journalist Carole Cadwalladr appeared at TED this week to discuss social networks with her customary restraint. Ina Fried reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nx0jPN&quot;&gt;She specifically singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as “accessories” to “subversion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lPecOs&quot;&gt;She called on Facebook to reveal more of what happened in Brexit and the 2016 U.S. elections. “It’s a crime scene and you have the evidence,” she said. “It’s not enough to say you will do better in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AjJj0e&quot;&gt;YouTube may want to think through whether it wants banned users to appear in videos created by the platform’s stars. Julia Alexander reports on Alex Jones’ cozying up to Logan Paul:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5369458128079&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f3PjjW&quot;&gt;This marked the second time in a month that Jones was allowed to appear on a popular YouTube personality’s channel, following a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alex-jones-completely-loses-it-again-during-marathon-joe-rogan-podcast-2019-02-28?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;four-hour appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; in February. During his latest appearance, Jones discussed dangerous conspiracy theories, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13870990/pizzagate-robertas-brooklyn-conspiracy-theory?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Pizzagate&lt;/a&gt; and misinformation about autism. These are examples of conspiracy theories that YouTube has spent time trying to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IsxmQm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/14/trivia-game-of-thrones/?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutiny at HQ Trivia fails to oust CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EbuKJl&quot;&gt;I wanted to write a lead column about HQ’s sad decline, and perhaps I’ll still get around to it. But in the meantime read Josh Constine’s absolutely wild account of the startup’s past five months, which have been more dramatic than any social-media since &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal%2Fdp%2F1591847087%3Futm_campaign%3DThe%2520Interface%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DRevue%2520newsletter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peak boardroom-drama Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bHrgVM&quot;&gt;By February 2019, HQ’s staff was fed up. Two sources confirm that 20 of the roughly 35 employees signed a letter asking the board to remove Yusupov and establish a new CEO. With HQ’s download rate continuing to sink, they feared he’d run the startup into the ground. One source suggested Yusupov might rather have seen the whole startup come crashing down with the blame placed on the product than have it come to light that he played a large hand in the fall. The tone of the letter, which was never formally delivered but sources believe the board knew of, wasn’t accusatory but a plea for transparency about the company’s future and the staff’s job security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aReehP&quot;&gt;At a hastily convened all-hands meeting in late February, HQ investor Liew told the company his fund Lightspeed would support a search for a new CEO to replace Yusupov, and provide that new CEO with funding for 18 more months of runway. Liew told the staff he would step down from the board once that CEO was found, but the search continues and so Liew remains on HQ’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;7YoKPu&quot;&gt;Despite HQ’s struggles, it still can be valuable to advertisers, Kerry Flynn reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13.484848484848&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RyScN0&quot;&gt;To sell sponsorships, HQ’s team touts the game’s concurrent viewership. HQ hasn’t been able to reach the same heights it had in 2018 — the game peaked with 2.4 million concurrent viewers last March during a game with a $250,000 jackpot — but it still attracts hundreds of thousands per game. For example, HQ’s “The Twilight Zone” game had about 478,000 viewers at question one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;amp;v=tsUe5qU3tdQ&quot;&gt;according to a recording of the game&lt;/a&gt;. HQ’s team compares that to current viewership on &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/facebooks-confetti-and-the-q-has-been-growing-hq-trivia-competitors-overseas/?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Facebook’s knockoff trivia games&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter’s live shows, which have concurrent viewers in the tens of thousands compared to hundreds of thousands on HQ, sources familiar with the discussions told Digiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4vLzxi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;sV73lE&quot;&gt;Twitter might be slow to addressing any of your personal concerns about the platform and its relationship to democracy, but it’s moving fast when it comes to big movie tie-ins. Julia Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15.897755610973&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0wGTJC&quot;&gt;Marvel Studios partnered with pop artist Truck Torrence to create the Twitter emoji seen in the photo below. The obvious superheroes are there — Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor, and Hawkeye — along with newcomers like the cast of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977756/black-panther-movie-review-ryan-coogler-marvel-cinematic-universe-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Captain Marvel, and Thanos himself. Most importantly, there are two emoji for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/6/16613050/thor-ragnarok-korg?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Korg and Miek&lt;/a&gt;, the best characters from &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;KzBvR1&quot;&gt;Charlie Warzel calls for a new definition of privacy in his new newsletter, which you should subscribe to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O0CO94&quot;&gt;At its heart, privacy is about how that data is used to take away our control. Today, our control is chipped away in ways large and small. It may be as innocuous as using your listed preferences, browsing behavior, third-party information about your annual income and a rough understanding of the hours that you’re most susceptible to make a purchase to nudge you toward buying a pair of shoes. Or it may be as potentially life-altering as the inability to get a loan or see a job listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N9pmRU&quot;&gt;For survivors of abuse, privacy might mean the freedom to live safely without exposing sensitive location information to stalkers. For undocumented immigrants, digital privacy could mean the difference between a parent being able to drop her child off at school or rush a loved one to the hospital without fear of deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MaNGYE&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/facebook-private-groups-online-abuse?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Groups Might Be The Last Good Thing About Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6slaWx&quot;&gt;Anne Helen Peterson writes about the positive impact that running a Facebook group has had on her life and work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tqYKSo&quot;&gt;I started the original group in 2009, and have never monetized it. I do it because I really, really like it, and the people who are part of it tell me they really, really like it too. It’s a place where I feel like I can ask questions, or for help working through an idea that’s not quite there yet. Members come from all over the world, and, according to Facebook’s analytics, 81% identify as women. Men periodically post in the comments. But they recognize, in a way I rarely see online, that their opinions are secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KoSkpE&quot;&gt;For many of us, these groups are one of the few remaining things tethering us to a platform that’s proven itself ineffective at combating toxicity, misinformation, and abuse in nearly every way. They provide community for people from all over the world, doing a bunch of different stuff, with a bunch of different and intersecting identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lArZ9K&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bYR5wq&quot;&gt;Hedgehogs are tiny and have salmonella and you should NOT snuggle with them, Eliza Brooke reports. But that hasn’t stopped them from becoming popular on Instagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;P2tif4&quot;&gt;“Hedgehogs and small exotic animals are often impulse purchases, so when [people] see a video of them eating a tiny birthday cake with a hat, you’re not actually getting that when you get your pet,” says Schindler. “Social media has encouraged ownership of animals that isn’t realistic for what they’re going to end up with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iHReQN&quot;&gt;After hearing that a few people had gotten hedgehogs because of Lionel, Mathias took it upon herself to post about the realities of hedgehog care on her website. “They’re real animals and come with a lot of responsibility,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Olympic medal-winning cyclist Rebecca Twigg is homeless in Seattle</title>
<link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/olympic-medal-winning-cyclist-rebecca-twigg-is-homeless-in-seattle/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/olympic-medal-winning-cyclist-rebecca-twigg-is-homeless-in-seattle/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When Rebecca Twigg was 7, she rode a bike for the first time. There were no training wheels, but Twigg took off like she’d done it in a previous life. She fell only when she realized she didn’t know how to stop, and steered into a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I took to the road like I was born to do it,” Twigg says today. “Except for the little part about stopping. I’m not a very good planner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle-raised athlete went on to become one of the most famous American cyclists in the ’80s and ’90s, winning six world championships and medaling in two Olympics. She appeared on cycling magazine covers, in sponsor ads and in features in Sports Illustrated and Vanity Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;font-tiny&quot;&gt;The Seattle Times’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/about-project-homeless/#about-project-homeless&quot;&gt;Project Homeless&lt;/a&gt; is funded by BECU, The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Campion Foundation, the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, Raikes Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Seattle Foundation, Seattle Mariners, Starbucks and the University of Washington. The Seattle Times maintains editorial control over Project Homeless content.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, in 1996, she left the team abruptly during the Olympics and the next year, retired from cycling. She re-entered the workforce. It didn’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve done something that feels like you’re born to do it, it’s hard to find anything that’s that good of a fit,” Twigg says today. “Anything else that feels that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Twigg has now been without a home for almost five years in Seattle, living first with friends and family, then in her car, then in homeless shelters and then, for a night, under garbage bags on the street downtown. She hasn’t had a bike for years, and no one recognizes her anymore, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container u-bg-dark-off-white full-width-inset mb-4 mt-4 pt-0 ad-container-multiple body1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg, 56, agreed to share her story to convince the public that not all homeless people are addicted to drugs or alcohol; that there are many like her, who have struggled with employment and are “confused,” as she said she is, about what to do next with their lives. She did not want to discuss mental health but feels it should be treated more seriously in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the hard days are really painful when you’re training for racing,” Twigg said, “but being homeless, when you have little hope or knowledge of where the finish line is going to be, is just as hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent morning, Twigg walked into Mary’s Place Women’s Day Center in downtown Seattle. She used to come here frequently after leaving one of a number of night shelters. Lots of women are here, taking showers or doing laundry, helping to clean. Talking with them is better than “getting lost in my own thoughts,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedwight Amoda, director at the center, walks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t seen you in a minute! Where are you?” Amoda asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the living room floor,” Twigg says, smiling. “On a mat.” She’s been staying with relatives in the area the last few weeks while she recovers from a bad flu. Her immediate family in the Seattle area, including her 18-year-old daughter, declined interviews for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote-header u-bold u-sans u-mid-light-gray&quot;&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote-content&quot;&gt;“Once you’ve done something that feels like you’re born to do it, it’s hard to find anything that’s that good of a fit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amoda was struck, soon after meeting Twigg in 2017, by how intelligent she was, how fit she looked in sports clothes and how late she stayed to clean after the day center closed. When Amoda learned who Twigg was, she was surprised that this woman, regarded as America’s best cyclist when she quit in 1997, is homeless today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m still confused, but I’m figuring it out,” Twigg tells Amoda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“I kind of lost my home base”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg was still a child when she became homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prodigy in academics and athletics, she started at UW at the age of 14, competing in cycling that same year and medaling in national races almost right away. At this time, she was living in Seattle in a basement with her mother and sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg’s sister says their mom kicked Twigg out; Twigg remembers being offered the option to leave and taking it. She was a few months from turning 16. She rode her bike to the old downtown Greyhound station, stayed up all night, and slept a few hours in the UW Library the next morning before calling her team leader and crashing at his house. The next years — as Twigg became a cycling star — were transient. She went from friends’ houses to hotels on the road while racing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I kind of lost my home base because I traveled so much,” Twigg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was spotted at 17 by famous cycling coach Eddie Borysewicz. After she won the world championship, he invited her to live in the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs and train for the 1984 Olympic Games, where for the first time, women would be competing on bicycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans dominated the Olympics that year. Twigg won a silver medal, missing gold by a few inches to famous racer Connie Carpenter. She continued on her way up over the next several years, setting world records, winning world titles, and racing more than 60 times a year. She became known for her competition in individual pursuit, where two cyclists start at the same time on opposite sides of the track and each tries to catch the other. She’s still among the most-decorated athletes in pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the breakneck pace couldn’t continue forever. She was married and soon after divorced. She crashed in Texas, broke her thumb and got 13 stitches in her head. The following year she felt burned out. She took a break at age 26, and that year she grew an entire inch, possibly because her body no longer had to expend so much energy training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg got an associate degree in computer science and became a programmer for a seaweed-products company in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg says the career wasn’t a perfect fit. She quit and started training for the 1992 Olympic Games, winning a bronze medal in the 3,000-meter pursuit after only nine months of training. As she entered her 30s, she became regarded as the best American female cyclist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;mrw-header pt-27&quot;&gt;Most Read Local Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The break with her career came in July 1996, at the Olympic Games in Atlanta. After a disappointing start to the Games, she left, saying the U.S. Cycling Federation was pressuring everyone to recreate the success of 1984. She raced in 1997, but placed eighth in the world championships. She retired for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From a bike to a desk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg went back to desk jobs in IT, then back to school for massage therapy. It didn’t pay enough, and she was offered another tech job. She married again, and had a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a far cry from winning medals for Twigg, and beyond that, she said the solitary nature of programming troubled her. She’d been friendly but introverted for much of her time traveling, according to fellow cyclist Inga Thompson, who traveled and competed alongside her for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering the workforce is hard for anyone that’s been a famous athlete, but it can be especially hard for superstar cyclists like Twigg, Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;native-ad-article u-bg-dark-off-white full-width-inset mb-4 mt-4 pt-0&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a racer, you’re used to having a schedule kind of rotate around you,” Thompson said, “because you can’t overtrain, you don’t want to under-train, and you’re able to say ‘I’m not doing that today, I’m doing this today.’ And Rebecca, being so highly trained, and highly attuned, had the leeway of making those calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson herself has avoided working at a desk. Today, she owns a cattle ranch in Oregon, where she’s her own boss. Thompson jokes she’s “unemployable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What (Twigg) has is a great trait,” Thompson said. “Unless you get into the workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg would take unspecified amounts of time off and sometimes be unreachable. Once, when she didn’t show up to work for four days, her co-workers called the police for a welfare check, according to a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there were miscommunications. When Twigg got back to the office after the welfare check, her desk phone didn’t work. Scared she was about to be fired, Twigg quit. She later learned they hadn’t planned on firing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container u-bg-dark-off-white full-width-inset mb-4 mt-4 pt-0 ad-container-single&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg didn’t have much money to fall back on. Even with sponsorships, at the height of her success, Twigg says she didn’t make more than $50,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg said anxiety inhibited her job search. She would apply and get an email about an interview, but she wouldn’t respond. She started experiencing strange sensations in her head and body, but doctors didn’t have any answers. She said she has considered suicide, but is convinced things don’t get better on “the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, Twigg was fired from an IT support job and moved back to Seattle, but this time didn’t even apply for jobs. She was 50, and felt the job postings in computer science were aimed at new college graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went from living with relatives to living in her car, letting her then-14-year-old daughter stay with relatives. Riding her bike no longer made sense to her, practically; she got sweaty if it was warm, or wet if it was raining, and staying clean and dry is hard when you’re homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave away her bike, her cycling taking a back seat to surviving. She started walking everywhere, slowly, to conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“I just had my head really mixed up”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twigg compares homelessness to traveling with no end to your trip. “You can never go home to rest,” Twigg said. She moved from her car to women’s and coed shelters in Seattle, and the pace of life there, too, was slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container u-bg-dark-off-white full-width-inset mb-4 mt-4 pt-0 ad-container-single&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-label font-micro u-tc u-mid-light-gray u-sans pv-10 u-upper&quot;&gt;Advertising&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are some shelters where it’s like a bus station. You’re just staring at someone else — it’s so boring.” But she says shelters kept her alive; today, this former Olympian is hassled off sidewalks by security guards, and struggles to find a place where she can simply stand around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, during the massive snowstorm, she saw people sleeping on the streets and felt bad that she had a warm bed in a shelter. There’s an odd “concert mentality” when you’re homeless, Twigg said, where it can be hard to separate yourself from the crowd. Her guilt and a sense that she had “unfair advantages” in life haven’t gone away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I felt at one time that I couldn’t accept housing because there were all these other people who need it,” Twigg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided to sleep outside, even if just for a night. She left the shelters, bought some garbage bags and got a thin blanket, and lay down on a sidewalk downtown, pulling one bag over her legs and one bag over her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was shivering, partly from fear, and partly from cold,” Twigg said. “I had this feeling of not really belonging anywhere. I just had my head really mixed up, totally confused about what I should be doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5 a.m., a security guard woke her up. Her blanket was wet. She went to a shelter that would let her in, and slept for half an hour sitting up. She knew she couldn’t spend another night outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote-content&quot;&gt;I felt at one time that I couldn’t accept housing because there were all these other people who need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, as her 56&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday approached, she got the flu and had to go to the hospital. From there, she persuaded a relative to take her in again so she could convalesce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From her own experience, Twigg thinks the answer is building more affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shelters are great, but there has to be a next step,” Twigg said. She still won’t accept housing for herself, even when help is offered by people who’ve found out about her state; her homelessness was mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.velonews.com/2019/03/commentary/the-outer-line-the-all-time-greatest-female-cyclists_488887&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;content-link external&quot;&gt;in a cycling magazine last month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The point is not so much that I need help, it’s that there are a bunch of people who need help — 12,000 in this area, half a million in the country,” Twigg said. “Help should be provided for everybody, not just a few.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they are Olympians.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fluent 1.0: a localization system for natural-sounding translations</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/fluent-1-0-a-localization-system-for-natural-sounding-translations/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/fluent-1-0-a-localization-system-for-natural-sounding-translations/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://projectfluent.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fluent&lt;/a&gt; is a family of localization specifications, implementations and good practices developed by Mozilla. It is currently used in Firefox. With Fluent, translators can create expressive translations that sound great in their language. Today we’re announcing version 1.0 of the Fluent file format specification. We’re inviting translation tool authors to try it out and provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Problem Fluent Solves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With almost 100 supported languages, Firefox faces many localization challenges. Using traditional localization solutions, these are difficult to overcome. Software localization has been dominated by an outdated paradigm: translations that map one-to-one to the source language. The grammar of the source language, which at Mozilla is English, imposes limits on the expressiveness of the translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following message which appears in Firefox when the user tries to close a window with more than one tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;tabs-close-warning-multiple =
    You are about to close {$count} tabs.
    Are you sure you want to continue?
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is only displayed when the tab count is 2 or more. In English, the word &lt;em&gt;tab&lt;/em&gt; will always appear as plural &lt;em&gt;tabs&lt;/em&gt;. An English-speaking developer may be content with this message. It sounds great for all possible values of &lt;code&gt;$count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/fluent_en.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;896&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-33409&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_en.png 896w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_en-250x52.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_en-768x160.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_en-500x104.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px&quot;/&gt;In English, a single variant of the message is enough for all values of &lt;code&gt;$count&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Many translators, however, will quickly point out that the word &lt;em&gt;tab&lt;/em&gt; will take different forms depending on the exact value of the &lt;code&gt;$count&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional localization solutions, the onus of fixing this message is on developers. They need to account for the fact that other languages distinguish between more than one plural form, even if English doesn’t. As the number of languages supported in the application grows, this problem scales up quickly—and not well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some languages, nouns have genders which require different forms of adjectives and past participles. In French, &lt;em&gt;connecté&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;connectée&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;connectés&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;connectées&lt;/em&gt; all mean &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style guides may require that different terms be used depending on the platform the software runs on. In English Firefox, we use &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; on Windows and &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; on other systems, to match the wording of the user’s operating system. In Japanese, the difference is starker: some computer-related terms are spelled with a different writing system depending on the user’s OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The context and the target audience of the application may require adjustments to the copy. In English, software used in accounting may format numbers differently than a social media website. Yet in other languages such a distinction may not be necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many grammatical and stylistic variations that don’t map one-to-one between languages. Supporting all of them using traditional localization solutions isn’t straightforward. Some language features require trade-offs in order to support them, or aren’t possible at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asymmetric Localization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluent turns the localization landscape on its head. Rather than require developers to predict all possible permutations of complexity in all supported languages, Fluent keeps the source language as simple as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it possible to cater to the grammar and style of other languages, independently of the source language. All of this happens in isolation; the fact that one language benefits from more advanced logic doesn’t require any other localization to apply it. Each localization is in control of how complex the translation becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the Czech translation of the “tab close” message discussed above. The word &lt;em&gt;panel&lt;/em&gt; (tab) must take one of two plural forms: &lt;em&gt;panely&lt;/em&gt; for counts of 2, 3, and 4, and &lt;em&gt;panelů&lt;/em&gt; for all other numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;tabs-close-warning-multiple = {$count -&amp;gt;
    [few] Chystáte se zavřít {$count} panely. Opravdu chcete pokračovat?
   *[other] Chystáte se zavřít {$count} panelů. Opravdu chcete pokračovat?
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluent empowers translators to create grammatically correct translations and leverage the expressive power of their language. With Fluent, the Czech translation can now benefit from correct plural forms for all possible values of the &lt;code&gt;$count&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/fluent_cz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;896&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-33410&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_cz.png 896w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_cz-250x88.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_cz-768x272.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/fluent_cz-500x177.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px&quot;/&gt;In Czech, &lt;code&gt;$count&lt;/code&gt; values of 2, 3, and 4 require a special plural form of the noun.
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, no changes are required to the source code nor the source copy. In fact, the logic added by the Czech translator to the Czech translation doesn’t affect any other language. The same message in French is a simple sentence, similar to the English one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;tabs-close-warning-multiple =
    Vous êtes sur le point de fermer {$count} onglets.
    Voulez-vous vraiment continuer ?
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;em&gt;asymmetric localization&lt;/em&gt; is the key innovation of Fluent, built upon 20 years of Mozilla’s history of successfully shipping localized software. Many key ideas in Fluent have also been inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;XLIFF&lt;/a&gt; and ICU’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MessageFormat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Fluent looks similar to other localization solutions that allow translations to use plurals and grammatical genders. What sets Fluent apart is the holistic approach to localization. Fluent takes these ideas further by defining the syntax for the entire text file in which multiple translations can be stored, and by allowing messages to reference other messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terms and References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fluent file may consist of many messages, each translated into the translator’s language. Messages can refer to other messages in the same file, or even to messages from other files. In the runtime, Fluent combines files into &lt;em&gt;bundles&lt;/em&gt;, and references are resolved in the scope of the current bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing messages is a powerful tool for ensuring consistency. Once defined, a translation can be reused in other translations. Fluent even has a special kind of message, called a &lt;em&gt;term&lt;/em&gt;, which is best suited for reuse. Term identifiers always start with a dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;-sync-brand-name = Firefox Account
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once defined, the &lt;code&gt;-sync-brand-name&lt;/code&gt; term can be referenced from other messages, and it will always resolve to the same value. Terms help enforce style guidelines; they can also be swapped in and out to modify the branding in unofficial builds and on beta release channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;sync-dialog-title = {-sync-brand-name}
sync-headline-title =
    {-sync-brand-name}: The best way to bring
    your data always with you
sync-signedout-account-title =
    Connect with your {-sync-brand-name}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using terms verbatim in the middle of a sentence may cause trouble for inflected languages or for languages with different capitalization rules than English. Terms can define multiple facets of their value, suitable for use in different contexts. Consider the following definition of the &lt;code&gt;-sync-brand-name&lt;/code&gt; term in Italian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;-sync-brand-name = {$capitalization -&amp;gt;
   *[uppercase] Account Firefox
    [lowercase] account Firefox
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the asymmetric nature of Fluent, the Italian translator is free to define two facets of the brand name. The default one (uppercase) is suitable for standalone appearances as well as for use at the beginning of sentences. The lowercase version can be explicitly requested by passing the capitalization parameter, when the brand name is used inside a larger sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;sync-dialog-title = {-sync-brand-name}
sync-headline-title =
    {-sync-brand-name}: il modo migliore
    per avere i tuoi dati sempre con te

# Explicitly request the lowercase variant of the brand name.
sync-signedout-account-title =
    Connetti il tuo {-sync-brand-name(capitalization: &quot;lowercase&quot;)}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining multiple term variants is a versatile technique which allows the localization to cater to the grammatical needs of many languages. In the following example, the Polish translation can use declensions to construct a grammatically correct sentence in the &lt;code&gt;sync-signedout-account-title&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;-sync-brand-name = {$case -&amp;gt;
   *[nominative] Konto Firefox
    [genitive] Konta Firefox
    [accusative] Kontem Firefox
}

sync-signedout-account-title =
    Zaloguj do {-sync-brand-name(case: &quot;genitive&quot;)}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluent makes it possible to express linguistic complexities when necessary. At the same time, simple translations remain simple. Fluent doesn’t impose complexity unless it’s required to create a correct translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;sync-signedout-caption = Take Your Web With You
sync-signedout-caption = Il tuo Web, sempre con te
sync-signedout-caption = Zabierz swoją sieć ze sobą
sync-signedout-caption = So haben Sie das Web überall dabei.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fluent Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing the first stable release of the Fluent Syntax. It’s a formal specification of the file format for storing translations, accompanied by beta releases of parser implementations in JavaScript, Python, and Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve already seen a taste of Fluent Syntax in the examples above. It has been designed with non-technical people in mind, and to make the task of reviewing and editing translations easy and error-proof. Error recovery is a strong focus: it’s impossible for a single broken translation to break the entire file, or even the translations adjacent to it. Comments may be used to communicate contextual information about the purpose of a message or a group of messages. Translations can span multiple lines, which helps when working with longer text or markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluent files can be opened and edited in any text editor, lowering the barrier to entry for developers and localizers alike. The file format is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/l10n/2019/04/11/implementing-fluent-in-a-localization-tool/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;well supported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://pontoon.mozilla.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pontoon&lt;/a&gt;, Mozilla’s open-source translation management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the syntax by reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fluent Syntax Guide&lt;/a&gt;. The formal definition can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fluent Syntax specification&lt;/a&gt;. And if you just want to quickly see it in action, try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectfluent.org/play/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fluent Playground&lt;/a&gt;—an online editor with shareable Fluent snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Request for Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox has been the main driver behind the development of Fluent so far. Today, there are over &lt;a href=&quot;https://arewefluentyet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;3000 Fluent messages in Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. The migration from legacy localization formats started early last year and is now in full swing. Fluent has proven to be a stable and flexible solution for building complex interfaces, such as the UI of Firefox Preferences. It is also used in a number of Mozilla websites, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://send.firefox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox Send&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://voice.mozilla.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Common Voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think Fluent is a great choice for applications that value simplicity and a lean runtime, and at the same time require that elements of the interface depend on multiple variables. In particular, Fluent can help create natural-sounding translations in size-constrained UIs of mobile apps; in information-rich layouts of social media platforms; and in games, to communicate gameplay statistics and mechanics to the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear from projects and localization vendors outside of Mozilla. Because we’re developing Fluent with a future standard in mind, we invite you to try it out and let us know if it addresses your challenges. With your help, we can iterate and improve Fluent to address the needs of many platforms, use cases, and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re open to your constructive feedback. Learn more about Fluent on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projectfluent.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;project’s website&lt;/a&gt; and please get in touch on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/fluent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fluent’s Discourse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft loses control over Windows Tiles</title>
<link>https://www.golem.de/news/subdomain-takeover-microsoft-loses-control-over-windows-tiles-1904-140717.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.golem.de/news/subdomain-takeover-microsoft-loses-control-over-windows-tiles-1904-140717.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;gpar1&quot;&gt;The Tiles service Microsoft introduced with Windows 8 has never been particularly successful. Microsoft has disabled a web service for the system but forgot to delete nameserver entries. This made the host vulnerable for a subdomain takeover attack - allowing us to control the contents. By doing so we were able to show arbitrary pictures and text within the tiles of other web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;supplementary&quot; id=&quot;job-market&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stellenmarkt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;

Techniker Krankenkasse, Hamburg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;text1&quot;&gt;

BRZ Deutschland GmbH, Nürnberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cpxl.golem.de/gif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2F&amp;amp;d=1555544342&amp;amp;f=ev&amp;amp;v=d&amp;amp;t=ad%2Fjobs2018kw10&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;gpar2&quot;&gt;The tiles can fullfil a number of functions. They allow web pages to display news on the tiles with a special meta tag. This function is called Windows Live Tiles. Web pages which support this service can be pinned as a tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft service converts RSS feed to Tiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar3&quot;&gt;With a special XML-based file format, web pages can control the content of the tiles; for example, they can show the latest news. To make it easier for web pages to provide this function, Microsoft ran a service that automatically converted RSS feeds into that special XML format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar4&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buildmypinnedsite.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-external-url&quot;&gt;web page that allows creating the corresponding meta tags is still online&lt;/a&gt;, although the service no longer works. The host that should deliver the XML files - notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com - only showed an error message from Microsoft's cloud service Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;gpar5&quot;&gt;The abandoned host was vulnerable for a so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golem.de/news/subdomain-takeover-verwaiste-domains-einfach-uebernehmen-1807-135513.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;golem-internal-url golem-url-news&quot;&gt;subdomain takeover attack&lt;/a&gt;. The host was redirected to a subdomain of Azure. However this subdomain wasn't registered with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Azure subdomain could be re-registered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar6&quot;&gt;The takeover works via a so-called CNAME nameserver entry. It redirects all requests for the host to the unregistered Azure subdomain. With an ordinary Azure account, we were able to register that subdomain and add the corresponding host name. Thus we were able to control which content is served on that host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar7&quot;&gt;Web pages using the defunct service from Microsoft included the Russian mail provider Mail.ru, Engadget, and German news sites Heise Online and Giga. Web pages that include these meta tags should remove them or, if they want to keep the functionality, create the corresponding XML files themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microsoft does not answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gpar8&quot;&gt;We have informed Microsoft about this problem but haven't received a reply yet. We won't keep the host registered permanently. There's a decent amount of traffic reaching this host and running up costs to hold the domain and block the corresponding subdomain even if we stop the web service and don't provide any content. Once we cancel the subdomain a bad actor could register it and abuse it for malicious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gfpop&quot;&gt;Windows Tiles were introduced on the start screen of Windows 8 and moved to the start menu in Windows 10. They have never been particularly popular. The web page Windowscentral speculated in January that the Tiles may be deprecated soon. The upcoming Windows Lite is rumored to come without Tiles already.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s Encrypt to transition to ISRG root</title>
<link>https://scotthelme.co.uk/lets-encrypt-to-transition-to-isrg-root/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://scotthelme.co.uk/lets-encrypt-to-transition-to-isrg-root/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt have announced that on July 8th, 2019 they will begin issuing new certificates from their own intermediate CA and not their current cross-signed intermediate. Here's what that means and what action, if any, site operators need to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;let-s-encrypt&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spoken &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/setting-up-le/&quot;&gt;extensively&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; on my blog and I'm a huge supporter of theirs. Not only do they give out free certificates, but their process can be easily automated, leading to a huge increase in adoption of HTTPS across the web. Today they &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2019/04/15/transitioning-to-isrg-root.html&quot;&gt;made an announcement&lt;/a&gt; that they plan to make a change on July 8th, 2019. Here's what that change means and what you need to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/04/le-logo-wide.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;cross-signing&quot;&gt;Cross-signing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all new CAs, Let's Encrypt began life with a cross-signature. Cross-signing is a trick that CAs can use to avoid the years long process of becoming a root CA. It genuinely does take many years to go through this process and Let's Encrypt wouldn't have been able to issue any certificates over the last 3+ years without a cross-sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-signing essentially makes you a CA by using the trust placed in another CA. I don't want to go too far into the technical details of that process here, instead I want to focus on what it means for site operators and the action they need to take, if any. If you'd really like the technical details, it might be worth attending &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feistyduck.com/training/the-best-ssl-and-tls-training-in-the-world&quot;&gt;The Best TLS Training in the World&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, where the topics of cross-signing, subordinate CAs and much more are covered in great detail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/04/image-3.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Let's Encrypt currently issue from their cross-signed intermediate, which is issued to them by IdenTrust. IdenTrust have been a CA for many years and even old, legacy clients recognise them as a CA. When you get a certificate from Let's Encrypt right now it is issued by the cross-signed X3 intermediate which chains to the IdenTrust root. Now that Let's Encrypt's ISRG root is widely trusted, they can instead switch to issuing from their own X3 intermediate instead of the cross-signed one. This is a big step forwards for them and will likely not mean anything to the vast majority of their users. There are a few considerations though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;legacy-clients&quot;&gt;Legacy clients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, we just can't get away from them! As the ISRG root has only &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs.html&quot;&gt;recently been recognised&lt;/a&gt; by all of the major platforms, there is a small consideration for clients. Let's say that the ISRG root was recognised by Microsoft in Aug 2018. That means a Windows device would need to have done a Windows update since then to have been updated with that new information. If the device hasn't done a Windows update, then it can't know about this fancy, new ISRG root CA. This means that particular device would not recognise the certificates issued by the ISRG root as trusted. That's exactly the reason we have the cross-sign. By issuing from the cross-signed X3 intermediate, the client will recognise the IdenTrust root CA as trusted and thus recognise the intermediate and leaf certificate as trusted. The IdenTrust root was distributed many years ago and there is a good chance that the client has been updated in that time to know about it. Here lies the problem with the change of intermediate. Do your clients have the ISRG root in their trust store? That's the $1,000,000 question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's Encrypt have setup a &lt;a href=&quot;https://valid-isrgrootx1.letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;test site&lt;/a&gt; so you can see if a particular client can access it and know that they will be ok with your new certificates come July when the switch happens. This is the chain that is built by my install of Chrome on Windows, both fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/04/image-4.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my client didn't have the ISRG root in the trust store then this connection would fail as there was no trusted root to anchor the chain on. If you access this test site and your client doesn't work, you have a problem that you need to (and can) solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Let's Encrypt switch to issuing from their own X3 intermediate, if you want to support legacy clients that don't have the ISRG root in their trust store, there is a simple fix for you. All you need to do is continue to serve the old, cross-signed intermediate in the TLS handshake instead of the new one provided via ACME. Because both of the X3 intermediates use the same key pair, &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; of the intermediates can be used to validate a chain, regardless of which of the intermediates actually issued the leaf certificate. Essentially what this means is that if you need your clients to keep building a chain down to the IdenTrust root instead of the ISRG root, you simply need to update your server to continue serving the old intermediate instead of the new one, and everything will work just fine (* for now, keep reading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;sites-that-hard-coded-the-old-intermediate&quot;&gt;Sites that hard-coded the old intermediate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tecnically speaking, the intermediate certificate is as dynamic as the leaf certificate. Every time you get a new leaf certificate you may need to use a new intermediate certificate. Now, 99.999999% of the time that's not the case and intermediates are very long lived certificates, but here we are at the 0.000001% of the time when they can, and do, change. On July 8th, 2019 your new Let's Encrypt certificate will be issued from the X3 intermediate that chains to the ISRG root, but your site/service might continue to serve the cross-signed X3 intermediate during the TLS handshake. It is possible for a change like this to break your certificate chain, and thus the connection to your site, but for the reasons mentioned above, it won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get a new certificate issued from the X3 intermediate that chains to the ISRG root, but you serve the old, cross-signed X3 intermediate in the TLS handshake, the connection will still work (* for now, keep reading). This is because both of the intermediates are using the same key pair and as I said above, a certificate issued from either of the X3 intermediates can be validated using either of the X3 intermediates. This is a nifty trick to prevent breakage and Let's Encrypt have likely done this &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; for this reason, to look after their users when this time came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-cross-signed-x3-is-expiring&quot;&gt;The cross-signed X3 is expiring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates don't last forever and intermediates are no exception. The current, cross-signed X3 intermediate will expire on March 18th 2021 (or likely March 17th depending on time zone) and that means that's the last date at which you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/04/image-5.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're using this cross-signed intermediate for legacy client support, as I mentioned above, then you need to have a plan in place to take action before this date. Let's Encrypt are trying to help you out and they are obtaining a new intermediate that will be valid until September 29th 2021, giving you an extra few months. All you'd need to do is obtain a copy of this new cross-signed intermediate and serve that in your TLS handshake with legacy clients instead of the current one. There is a valid reason they can only buy you a few extra moths of support though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-identrust-root-is-expiring&quot;&gt;The IdenTrust root is expiring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current cross-signed X3, and the new cross-signed X3, simply can't be valid past September 30th, 2021 as that's when the IdenTrust root certificate expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/04/image-6.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the final date by which everyone must have moved over to using a certificate chain that chains to the ISRG root certificate if you're going to continue to use Let's Encrypt certificates. The old cross-signed X3 and the new cross-signed X3 will have both expired by then and the chain is definitely useless once the root has expired. If you still have legacy client concerns by September 30th, 2021, these clients won't have been updated for over 4.5 years and you will need to convince them to update if they want to continue to be able to access your site/service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-ca-problem-not-a-let-s-encrypt-problem&quot;&gt;A CA problem, not a Let's Encrypt problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All certificates expire. All CAs start out life as a subordinate. None of the issues here are specific to Let's Encrypt, it's simply their turn to go through the process. All existing CAs will have either gone through this process or will have to go through this process at some point in the future. I just want to clarify that this action isn't necessary because you chose to use Let's Encrypt, it's necessary because of how CAs and the PKI ecosystem work. If you hang around long enough, you'll have to go through this process eventually no matter which CA you use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Animating URLs with JavaScript and Emojis</title>
<link>http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/#%F0%9F%8C%92</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/#%F0%9F%8C%92</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com&quot;&gt;Matthew Rayfield&lt;/a&gt; on January 17th 2019&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YZt4HEv48Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs. And wow is it great. But no one seems to do it. Why? Perhaps emoji are too exotic for normie web platforms to handle? Or maybe they are avoided for fear of angering the SEO gods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, the overlapping portion on the Venn diagram of &quot;It's Possible v.s. No One Is Doing It&quot; is where my excitement usually lies. So I decided to put a little time into the possibilities of graphical characters in URLs. Specifically, with the possibility for animating these characters by way of some Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loopin'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, make sure your page's Javascript code is being labelled as UTF-8 or you're gonna have a bad time putting emoji in your code at all. This can be accomplished via an HTTP header, or page META tag. There's a good chance you don't have to worry about this. But you can find more info about this here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-unicode/&quot; target=&quot;_none&quot;&gt;Unicode in Javascript by Flavio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve our desired outcome of emoji dancing like sugar plum fairies in our address bar, we need a loop. And really, all we need is a loop. We start the loop, it loops, and we're happy. So here's our first loop, a spinning emoji moon. I think when they added this sequence of emoji they must have had this in mind right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moon.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var f = ['🌑', '🌒', '🌓', '🌔', '🌝', '🌖', '🌗', '🌘'];

    function loop() {
        location.hash = f[Math.floor((Date.now()/100)%f.length)];

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;moon-check&quot;&gt;Run Moon Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;moon-check&quot; value=&quot;moon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click the toggle checkbox above to see the result of this loop in your URL bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the spinning moons you can swap out that array with whatever emojis you want. Like a clock:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/clock.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var f = ['🕐','🕑','🕒','🕓','🕔','🕕','🕖','🕗','🕘','🕙','🕚','🕛'];
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;clock-check&quot;&gt;Run Clock Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;clock-check&quot; value=&quot;clock&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real simple example. Too simple really. So let's upgrade our loop so that it generates a string of multiple emoji! This time we're utilizing the emoji &quot;skin tone modifiers&quot; characters to make some color-changing babies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/babies2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var e = ['🏻', '🏼', '🏽', '🏾', '🏿'];

    function loop() {
        var s = '',
            i, m;

        for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i ++) {
            m = Math.floor(e.length * ((Math.sin((Date.now()/100) + i)+1)/2));
            s += '👶' + e[m];
        }

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;babies-check&quot;&gt;Run Babies Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;babies-check&quot; value=&quot;babies&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a sine wave controlled by time and position to select which color we want. This gives us a nice loopy color changing effect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about we revisit our moon spinner, spread it out, and make something resembling a loading indicator? Sure, let's do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/moons.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var f = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕', '🌔', '🌓', '🌒'],
        d = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        m = 0;

    function loop() {
        var s = '', x = 0;

        if (!m) {
            while (d[x] == 4) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &amp;gt;= d.length) m = 1;
            else {
                d[x] ++;
            }
        }
        else {
            while (d[x] == 0) {
                x ++;
            }

            if (x &amp;gt;= d.length) m = 0;
            else {
                d[x] ++;

                if (d[x] == 8) d[x] = 0;
            }
        }

        d.forEach(function (n) {
            s += f[n];
        });

        location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;multi-moon-check&quot;&gt;Run Multi-Moon Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;multi-moon-check&quot; value=&quot;multi-moon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploring Other Characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just emoji that give us a means to pump graphics out of our URL bar. There's a whole boatload of unicode characters of interest to our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly interesting are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character&quot; target=&quot;_none&quot;&gt;Box-drawing Characters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/box-characters.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these lend themselves better to a two dimensional output. But they're still pretty good on the single line we have to play with. For instance we can make a string of multiple height varied block characters and construct a nice little wave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/wavy.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function loop() {
        var i, n, s = '';

        for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++) {
            n = Math.floor(Math.sin((Date.now()/200) + (i/2)) * 4) + 4;

            s += String.fromCharCode(0x2581 + n);
        }

        window.location.hash = s;

        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }

    loop();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;wavy-check&quot;&gt;Run Wavy Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;wavy-check&quot; value=&quot;wavy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked this look so much I put it up permanently at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wavyurl.com&quot; target=&quot;_none&quot;&gt;wavyurl.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the variable width characters we can even wiggle on the horizontal, creating something like a progress bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/progress.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
function loop() {
        var s = '',
            p;

        p = Math.floor(((Math.sin(Date.now()/300)+1)/2) * 100);

        while (p &amp;gt;= 8) {
            s += '█';
            p -= 8;
        }
        s += ['⠀','▏','▎','▍','▌','▋','▊','▉'][p];

        location.hash = s;
        setTimeout(loop, 50);
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;progress-bar-check&quot;&gt;Run Progress Bar Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;progress-bar-check&quot; value=&quot;progress-bar&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A progress bar huh? That's like, almost useful. Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Displaying Video Progress In The URL Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to reduce the frivolity in our little experiment, I came up with the idea to show a web video's progress in the URL. I simply attach a function that renders our progress string to the &quot;timeupdate&quot; event for a video, and voila! A video progress indicator in the URL, complete with the time and duration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-progress.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            l = 15,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * (l-1)),
            i;

        for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; l; i ++) {
            if (i == p) s +='◯';
            else if (i &amp;lt; p) s += '─';
            else s += '┄';
        }

        location.hash = '╭'+s+'╮'+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;video-progress-check&quot;&gt;Run Video Progress Bar Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;video-progress-check&quot; value=&quot;video-progress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above checkbox checked, you can use the video below to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather like this lines and circle progress bar, but if you fancy some moon emoji, I've got you covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/video-moons.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var e = ['🌑', '🌘', '🌗', '🌖', '🌕'],
        video;

    function formatTime(seconds) {
        var minutes = Math.floor(seconds/60),
            seconds = Math.floor(seconds - (minutes*60));

        return ('0'+minutes).substr(-2) + ':' + ('0'+seconds).substr(-2);
    }

    function renderProgressBar() {
        var s = '',
            c = 0,
            l = 10,
            p = Math.floor(video.currentTime / video.duration * ((l*5)-1)),
            i;

        while (p &amp;gt;= 5) {
            s += e[4];
            c ++;
            p -= 5;
        }
        s += e[p];
        c ++;

        while (c &amp;lt; l) {
            s += e[0];
            c ++;
        }

        location.hash = s+formatTime(video.currentTime)+'╱'+formatTime(video.duration);
    }

    video = document.getElementById('video');
    video.addEventListener('timeupdate', renderProgressBar);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;video-moons-check&quot;&gt;Run Video Moons Progress Bar Code:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;video-moons-check&quot; value=&quot;video-moons&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, calling this progress bar &quot;useful&quot; is a stretch. But if I squint, I can almost see a scenario where it would be useful to have this in a video sharing URL. Like YouTube has the option of creating a link to a video at a specific time. Might it not be cool to include a visual indication? Hmmm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is some more useful implementation of this &quot;technology&quot; that I haven't come up with. I'll keep thinking on that. And hey, maybe you can come up with something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Last Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why I used &quot;location.hash =&quot; instead of the newer and shinier HTML5 History API. Two reasons. One solvable. The other less so. Both inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue 1 is also a feature of the History API: It actually changes the whole URL path, not just the hash. So if I use the History API and change our page to &quot;/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕&quot;, it'll look nicer than having tacked on a #. But it also means my web server must be able to response to &quot;/🌑🌘🌗🌖🌕&quot;, or the user will be out of luck if they refresh, or otherwise navigate to the modified URL. This is doable, but trickier than using &quot;location.hash =&quot; which doesn't require me to prepare the server in any special way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue 2 is more unexpected. Turns out that in 2 out of 3 browsers I tested, the History API is throttled. If I push my wavy URL characters to the address bar at a fast rate I'll eventually get the following error in Chrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Throttling history state changes to prevent the browser from hanging.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safari is nice enough to give us a bit more info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
SecurityError: Attempt to use history.pushState() more than 100 times per 30.000000 seconds
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I stay under that limit I'm fine. But c'mon, 3 frames a second just doesn't cut it for the ooey gooey URL animations I desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good boy Firefox on the other hand doesn't seem to give a hoot how many times I push a new history or how quickly. Which is gosh darn thoughtful of it. But breaking in two major browsers, plus neccesitating the web server configuration to fix Issue 1, makes me willing to put up with a little # in the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The End ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it there. But I will tell ya that I've got a few ideas for making tiny games that display in the URL bar. Especially given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns&quot;&gt;Braille Characters&lt;/a&gt; that we have yet to explore. So stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, comments, or simply want to keep up with my latest tinkerings, check me out on Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/MatthewRayfield&quot;&gt;@MatthewRayfield&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you want the source for these URL mutilating abominations wrapped up in nice little ready-to-run HTML files, &lt;a href=&quot;http://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/animated-urls-source-code.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; you go ;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye for now!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel Exiting 5G Modems</title>
<link>https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/#gs.639at4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/#gs.639at4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 16, 2019 – Intel Corporation today announced its intention to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and complete an assessment of the opportunities for 4G and 5G modems in PCs, internet of things devices and other data-centric devices. Intel will also continue to invest in its 5G network infrastructure business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue to meet current customer commitments for its existing 4G smartphone modem product line, but does not expect to launch 5G modem products in the smartphone space, including those originally planned for launches in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very excited about the opportunity in 5G and the ‘cloudification’ of the network, but in the smartphone modem business it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns,” said Intel CEO Bob Swan. “5G continues to be a strategic priority across Intel, and our team has developed a valuable portfolio of wireless products and intellectual property. We are assessing our options to realize the value we have created, including the opportunities in a wide variety of data-centric platforms and devices in a 5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel expects to provide additional details in its upcoming first-quarter 2019 earnings release and conference call, scheduled for April 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward-Looking Statements&lt;/strong&gt;Statements in this press release that refer to future plans and expectations are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on estimates, forecasts, projections, uncertain events or assumptions, including statements relating to anticipated trends in our businesses or the markets relevant to them, also identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this release are based on management’s expectations as of the date of this release and, except as required by law, Intel disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s expectations are set forth in Intel’s earnings release dated January 24, 2019, which is included as an exhibit to Intel’s Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on such date. Additional information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel’s results is included in Intel’s SEC filings, including the company’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Copies of Intel’s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website at www.intc.com or the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
