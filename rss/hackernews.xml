<title>Smithsonian Releases 2.8M Images into Public Domain</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Culture connoisseurs, rejoice: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution&lt;/a&gt; is inviting the world to engage with its vast repository of resources like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in its 174-year history, the Smithsonian has released 2.8 million high-resolution two- and three-dimensional images from across its collections onto an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/openaccess&quot;&gt;open access online platform&lt;/a&gt; for patrons to peruse and download free of charge. Featuring data and material from all 19 Smithsonian museums, nine research centers, libraries, archives and the National Zoo, the new digital depot encourages the public to not just view its contents, but use, reuse and transform them into just about anything they choose—be it a postcard, a beer koozie or a pair of bootie shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this gargantuan data dump is just the beginning. Throughout the rest of 2020, the Smithsonian will be rolling out another 200,000 or so images, with more to come as the Institution continues to digitize its collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/collections&quot;&gt;155 million items and counting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being a relevant source for people who are learning around the world is key to our mission,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.si.edu/display/nKapsalisE3152005&quot;&gt;Effie Kapsalis&lt;/a&gt;, who is heading up the effort as the Smithsonian’s senior digital program officer. “We can’t imagine what people are going to do with the collections. We’re prepared to be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database’s launch also marks the latest victory for a growing global effort to migrate museum collections into the public domain. Nearly 200 other institutions worldwide—including Amsterdam’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/explore-netherlands-most-iconic-museum-180959578/&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/art-institute-chicago-now-offers-open-access-44313-images-and-counting-its-collections-180970633/&quot;&gt;Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;—have made similar moves to digitize and liberate their masterworks in recent years. But the scale of the Smithsonian’s release is “unprecedented” in both depth and breadth, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/professor-simon-tanner&quot;&gt;Simon Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, an expert in digital cultural heritage at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning the arts and humanities to science and engineering, the release compiles artifacts, specimens and datasets from an array of fields onto a single online platform. Noteworthy additions include portraits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.65.61&quot;&gt;Pocahontas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2009.36&quot;&gt;Ida B. Wells&lt;/a&gt;, images of Muhammad Ali’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2010.19.1&quot;&gt;boxing headgear&lt;/a&gt; and Amelia Earhart’s record-shattering &lt;a href=&quot;https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-vega-5b-amelia-earhart&quot;&gt;Lockheed Vega 5B&lt;/a&gt;, along with thousands of 3-D models that range in size from a petite &lt;a href=&quot;https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/embreea-herrenhusana:ee5523da-9d43-475b-b9f3-f000b7b8a156?destination=node/10?edan_local=&amp;amp;edan_q=flower&quot;&gt;Embreea orchid&lt;/a&gt; just a few centimeters in length to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/casa/&quot;&gt;Cassiopeia A supernova remnant&lt;/a&gt;, estimated at about 29 light-years across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5vC2kweCNk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sheer scale of this interdisciplinary dataset is astonishing,” says Tanner, who advised Smithsonian’s open access initiative. “It opens up a much wider scope of content that crosses science and culture, space and time, in a way that no other collection out there has done, or could possibly even do. This is a staggering contribution to human knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until recently, the Smithsonian was among the thousands of museums and cultural centers around the world that still retained the rights to high-quality digital versions of their artworks, releasing them only upon request for personal or educational purposes and forbidding commercialization. The reluctance is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://museumsdigitalculture.prattsi.org/beyond-digitization-planning-for-open-access-collections-fb7325163f5d&quot;&gt;often justified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Institutions may be beholden to copyrights, for instance, or worry that ceding control over certain works could lead to their exploitation or forgery, or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/start-2020-ushers-thousands-once-copyrighted-works-public-domain-180973887/&quot;&gt;sully their reputation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;through sheer overuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Kapsalis thinks the &lt;a href=&quot;http://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf&quot;&gt;benefits of the Smithsonian’s public push&lt;/a&gt;, which falls in line with the Institution’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.edu/strategicplan/goal3&quot;&gt;digital-first strategy&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href=&quot;http://msc.mellon.org/msc-files/Open%20Access%20Report%2004%2025%2013-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;far outweigh&lt;/a&gt; the potential downsides. “Bad actors will still do bad,” she says. “We’re empowering good actors to do good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most tangible perks, Tanner says, is a “massive increase” in the scale of the public’s interaction with the Smithsonian—something that will maintain and boost the organization’s already substantial cultural cachet for audiences old and new, especially as content trickles onto open knowledge platforms like Wikipedia. “As soon as you open the collections up, it’s transformative,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the change, however, will happen far beyond the Smithsonian’s walls. Listed under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Zero&lt;/a&gt; (CC0) license, the 2.8 million images in the new database are now liberated from all restrictions, copyright or otherwise, enabling anyone with a decent Internet connection to build on them as raw materials—and ultimately participate in their evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digitizing the knowledge that’s held [at the Smithsonian] to access and reuse transfers a lot of the power to the public,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/law/staff/wallace/&quot;&gt;Andrea Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, an expert in cultural heritage law at the University of Exeter. People are now free to interact with these images, she says, “according to their own ideas, their own parameters, their own inspirations,” completely unencumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To showcase a few of the countless spin-offs that access to the collections might generate, the Smithsonian invited artists, educators and researchers for a sneak peak into the archives, and will be featuring some of their creations at a launch event set to take place this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;Artist Amy Karle unveils a series of sculptures of the National Museum of Natural History’s 66-million-year-old triceratops, Hatcher.&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/IogPMzElrQbLBKkT9QlncEiJtsw=/1024x596/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/89/ba/89ba082c-44a7-4232-9ea0-93ea1de3cded/2020_artist_amy_karle_deep_time_and_the_far_future_specimen_01_triceratops_sculpture_06_anodized_aluminum_collaboration_with_smithsonian_institution_a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artist Amy Karle unveils a series of sculptures of the National Museum of Natural History’s 66-million-year-old triceratops, Hatcher. &quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Artist Amy Karle unveils a series of sculptures of the National Museum of Natural History’s 66-million-year-old triceratops, Hatcher. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(2020 Amy Karle, collaboration with SI)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among them is a series of sculptures crafted by artist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amykarle.com/&quot;&gt;Amy Karle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, depicting the National Museum of Natural History’s 66-million-year-old triceratops, Hatcher. Karle, who specializes in 3-D artworks that highlight body form and function, was keen on bringing the fossil to life in an era where modern technology has made de-extinctions of ancient species a tantalizing possibility. Six of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amykarle.com/project/_smithsonian_collaboration/&quot;&gt;nine 3-D printed sculptures&lt;/a&gt; are intricate casts of Hatcher’s spine, each slightly “remixed” in the spirit of bioengineering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to share this kind of data,” Karle says. “Otherwise it’s like having a library with all the doors closed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on deck for the evening are three Smithsonian-inspired songs produced in collaboration with the Portland-based non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;https://bodeckerfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;N. M. Bodecker Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which offers creative mentorship to local students. Written and recorded by Bodecker mentees, the songs will hopefully make the colossal open access collection seem approachable, says Decemberists guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chrisfunkmusic.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Funk&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a recording studio on the grounds of the Bodecker Building and mentored the songs’ production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Historical figures probably wouldn’t be the first thing you’d hear written in modern music,” Funk says. But his students’ creations add a contemporary pop culture twist to the tales of prominent figures like &lt;a href=&quot;https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/solomon-brown-first-african-american-employee-smithsonian-institution&quot;&gt;Solomon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the Smithsonian’s first African American employee, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/mary-henry-eyewitness-civil-war&quot;&gt;Mary Henry&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the Institution’s first secretary, Joseph Henry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, author-illustrator duo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsworldwide.com/&quot;&gt;Jon Scieszka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenweinbergstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Weinberg&lt;/a&gt; will debut &lt;em&gt;How to Make a Collagasaurus&lt;/em&gt;, a how-to booklet inviting kids to transform the Smithsonian collections into zany new art forms. The approach is an echo of their 2019 children’s book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronuts.space/&quot;&gt;AstroNuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a cast of goofy, colorful characters pieced together from images from the Rijksmuseum’s 2013 open access launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the booklet, Smithsonian founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/stories/james-smithson-founder-smithsonian-institution&quot;&gt;James Smithson&lt;/a&gt;, backed by an entourage of AstroNuts, walks the reader through the construction of an example Collagasaurus, cobbled together from museum mainstays now in the public domain, including George Washington’s arm, a stegosaurus tail and Charlie Parker’s saxophone as an elephantine nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Steven and I are perfectly built for this,” Scieszka says. “The thing I love to do is take something somebody else has, and mess it up.” The goal, he adds, is to encourage kids to do the same—and maybe even learn a thing or two along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Walking through a museum is one way you can see a work of art,” Weinberg says. “When kids make their own … that’s when you start diving deeper into a subject. They’re going to have this really rich knowledge of pieces of art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span data-picture=&quot;&quot; data-alt=&quot;Spanning the arts and humanities to science and engineering, the release compiles artifacts, specimens, datasets and portraits (above: Ida B. Wells by Sallie E. Garrity) from an array of fields onto a single online platform.&quot;&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/x0A7j3ouRQ6ZNCfbI8hl-EHi3bA=/1024x596/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/9d/d2/9dd2a376-8e26-494f-9cce-6b3012f7f0f6/idabwells.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spanning the arts and humanities to science and engineering, the release compiles artifacts, specimens, datasets and portraits (above: Ida B. Wells by Sallie E. Garrity) from an array of fields onto a single online platform. &quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Spanning the arts and humanities to science and engineering, the release compiles artifacts, specimens, datasets and portraits (above: Ida B. Wells by Sallie E. Garrity) from an array of fields onto a single online platform. &lt;span class=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;(NPG)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bevy of research efforts are likely to flourish under the era of open access as well. In one partnership with Google, the Smithsonian has deployed machine-learning algorithms to its datasets to flesh out its list of notable women who have shaped the history of science—an effort that’s previously been aided by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://siarchives.si.edu/blog/thanks-your-help-women%E2%80%99s-history-month-summary-0&quot;&gt;contributions from the public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to see an item is a very different thing than to make another use of it,” Tanner says. “You get innovation more frequently and earlier if the knowledge people are relying on is available openly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 150 million additional items in its archives, museums, libraries and research centers, the Smithsonian is featuring less than 2 percent of its total collections in this initial launch. Much of the rest may someday be headed for a similar fate. But Kapsalis stresses the existence of an important subset that won’t be candidates for the public domain in the foreseeable future, including location information on endangered species, exploitative images and artifacts from marginalized communities. If released, data and materials like these could imperil the livelihood, values or even survival of a vulnerable population, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way people have captured some cultures in the past has not always been respectful,” Kapsalis says. “We don’t feel we could ethically share [these items] as open access.” Before that can even be discussed as a possibility, she adds, the communities affected must first be consulted and be made a crucial part of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kapsalis and other Smithsonian personnel also stress the importance of avoiding erasure. Many of these materials will remain available for viewing on-site at museums or even online, but the Smithsonian will retain restrictions on their use. “Representation can empower or disempower people,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://npg.si.edu/staff/ta%C3%ADna-caragol&quot;&gt;Taína Caragol&lt;/a&gt;, curator of painting and sculpture and Latino art and history at the National Portrait Gallery. “It can honor someone or be mocking. We are not banning access. But some things need more context, and they need a different protocol for accessing them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, the open access initiative forges a redefined relationship between the Smithsonian and its audiences around the world, Kapsalis says. That means trust has to go both ways. But at the same time, the launch also represents a modern-day revamp of the Institution’s mission—the “increase and diffusion of knowledge,” now tailored to all that the digital age has to offer. For the first time, visitors to the Smithsonian won’t just be observers, but participants and collaborators in its legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Smithsonian is our national collection, the people’s collection,” Funk says. “There’s something to that. To me, this [launch] is the Smithsonian saying: ‘This is your collection, to take and create with.’ That’s really empowering.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra (2012)</title>
<link>https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite two linear algebra classes, my knowledge consisted of “Matrices, determinants, eigen something something”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, let’s try this course format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name the course &lt;em&gt;Linear Algebra&lt;/em&gt; but focus on things called matrices and vectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach concepts like Row/Column order with mnemonics instead of explaining the reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favor abstract examples (2d vectors! 3d vectors!) and avoid real-world topics until the final week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survivors are physicists, graphics programmers and other masochists. We missed the key insight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear algebra gives you mini-spreadsheets for your math equations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take a table of data (a matrix) and create updated tables from the original. It’s the power of a spreadsheet written as an equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the linear algebra introduction I wish I had, with a real-world stock market example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Algebra” means, roughly, “relationships”. Grade-school algebra explores the relationship between unknown numbers. Without knowing x and y, we can still work out that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Linear Algebra” means, roughly, “line-like relationships”. Let’s clarify a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight lines are predictable. Imagine a rooftop: move forward 3 horizontal feet (relative to the ground) and you might rise 1 foot in elevation (The slope! Rise/run = 1/3). Move forward 6 feet, and you’d expect a rise of 2 feet. Contrast this with climbing a dome: each horizontal foot forward raises you a different amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lines are nice and predictable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, then going 10x as far should give a 10x rise (30 feet forward is a 10-foot rise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 3 feet forward has a 1-foot rise, and 6 feet has a 2-foot rise, then (3 + 6) feet should have a (1 + 2) foot rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In math terms, an operation F is linear if scaling inputs scales the output, and adding inputs adds the outputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/09fa24ebc98dc2d051aa341bdf3af939.png&quot; width=&quot;191.5&quot; height=&quot;46&quot; title=&quot; \begin{aligned} F(ax) &amp;amp;= a \cdot F(x) \\ F(x + y) &amp;amp;= F(x) + F(y) \end{aligned} &quot; alt=&quot; \begin{aligned} F(ax) &amp;amp;= a \cdot F(x) \\ F(x + y) &amp;amp;= F(x) + F(y) \end{aligned} &quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, $F(x)$ calculates the rise when moving forward x feet, and the properties hold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/5daca54e0e1b24f95be0e19730c347ef.png&quot; width=&quot;203&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{F(10 \cdot 3) = 10 \cdot F(3) = 10}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{F(10 \cdot 3) = 10 \cdot F(3) = 10}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/aa091456dff3c4fca20a57b14c3de208.png&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{F(3+6) = F(3) + F(6) = 3}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{F(3+6) = F(3) + F(6) = 3}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linear Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operation is a calculation based on some inputs. Which operations are linear and predictable? Multiplication, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exponents ($F(x) = x^2$) aren’t predictable: $10^2$ is 100, but $20^2$ is 400. We doubled the input but quadrupled the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, regular addition isn’t linear either. Consider the “add three” function $F(x) = x + 3$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/44f95c15b7b9d5b5f155692a1458f7f5.png&quot; width=&quot;87.5&quot; height=&quot;46&quot; title=&quot; \begin{aligned} F(10) &amp;amp;= 13 \\ F(20) &amp;amp;= 23 \end{aligned} &quot; alt=&quot; \begin{aligned} F(10) &amp;amp;= 13 \\ F(20) &amp;amp;= 23 \end{aligned} &quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We doubled the input and did not double the output. (Yes, $F(x) = x + 3$ happens to be the equation for an &lt;em&gt;offset&lt;/em&gt; line, but it’s still not “linear” because $F(10) \neq 10 \cdot F(1)$. Fun.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what types of functions are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; linear? Plain-old scaling by a constant, or functions that look like: $F(x) = ax$. In our roof example, $a = 1/3$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But life isn’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; boring. We can still combine multiple linear functions ($A, B, C$) into a larger one, $G$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/9ae605d8349f11e71a75b0c9cb849bc6.png&quot; width=&quot;378.5&quot; height=&quot;18.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x,y,z) = A(x) + B(y) + C(z) = ax + by + cz }&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x,y,z) = A(x) + B(y) + C(z) = ax + by + cz }&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$G$ is still linear, since doubling the input continues to double the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/495b6ea1b9badbcb0db15ceb21899159.png&quot; width=&quot;558&quot; height=&quot;18.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{G(2x, 2y, 2z) = a(2x) + b(2y) + c(2z) = 2(ax + by + cz) = 2 \cdot G(x, y, z)}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{G(2x, 2y, 2z) = a(2x) + b(2y) + c(2z) = 2(ax + by + cz) = 2 \cdot G(x, y, z)}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have “mini arithmetic”: multiply inputs by a constant, and add the results. It’s actually useful because we can split inputs apart, analyze them individually, and combine the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/aaa2d86705d06b750e305ccacd68ce74.png&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x,y,z) = G(x,0,0) + G(0,y,0) + G(0,0,z)}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x,y,z) = G(x,0,0) + G(0,y,0) + G(0,0,z)}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we allowed non-linear operations (like $x^2$) we couldn’t split our work: $(a+b)^2 \neq a^2 + b^2$. Limiting ourselves to linear operations has its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organizing Inputs and Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most courses hit you in the face with the details of a matrix. “Ok kids, let’s learn to speak. Select a subject, verb and object. Next, conjugate the verb. Then, add the prepositions…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No!&lt;/strong&gt; Grammar is not the focus. What’s the key idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a bunch of inputs to track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have predictable, linear operations to perform (our “mini-arithmetic”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generate a result, perhaps transforming it again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok. First, how should we track a bunch of inputs? How about a list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x
y
z
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad. We could write it (x, y, z) too — hang onto that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, how should we track our operations? Remember, we only have “mini arithmetic”: multiplications by a constant, with a final addition. If our operation $F$ behaves like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/0e14e1462e4d71e33254bca3034f93f6.png&quot; width=&quot;197.5&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{F(x, y, z) = 3x + 4y + 5z}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{F(x, y, z) = 3x + 4y + 5z}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could abbreviate the entire function as (3, 4, 5). We know to multiply the first input by the first value, the second input by the second value, etc., and add the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only need the first input?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/7df6fe52f03a79f5d43aa7c581e741a4.png&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x, y, z) = 3x + 0y + 0z = (3, 0, 0)}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{G(x, y, z) = 3x + 0y + 0z = (3, 0, 0)}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s spice it up: how should we handle multiple sets of inputs? Let’s say we want to run operation F on both (a, b, c) and (x, y, z). We could try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/366129689a962a39d13fc8bba305e1b4.png&quot; width=&quot;149.5&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{F(a, b, c, x, y, z) = ?}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{F(a, b, c, x, y, z) = ?}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it won’t work: F expects 3 inputs, not 6. We should separate the inputs into groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;1st Input  2nd Input
--------------------
a          x
b          y
c          z
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much neater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how could we run the same input through several operations? Have a row for each operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;F: 3 4 5
G: 3 0 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neat. We’re getting organized: inputs in vertical columns, operations in horizontal rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualizing The Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words aren’t enough. Here’s how I visualize inputs, operations, and outputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images//linear-algebra-visualize-20121002-221620.png&quot; alt=&quot;linear algebra reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine “pouring” each input through each operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images//linear-algebra-pour-20121002-220550.png&quot; alt=&quot;linear algebra pour in&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an input passes an operation, it creates an output item. In our example, the input (a, b, c) goes against operation F and outputs 3a + 4b + 5c. It goes against operation G and outputs 3a + 0 + 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for the red pill. A matrix is a shorthand for our diagrams:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/3aa4f8c19764f6aed0969bee9b27bd57.png&quot; width=&quot;333.5&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; title=&quot;\text{I}\text{nputs} = A = \begin{bmatrix} \text{i}\text{nput1}&amp;amp;\text{i}\text{nput2}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a &amp;amp; x\\b &amp;amp; y\\c &amp;amp; z\end{bmatrix}&quot; alt=&quot;\text{I}\text{nputs} = A = \begin{bmatrix} \text{i}\text{nput1}&amp;amp;\text{i}\text{nput2}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a &amp;amp; x\\b &amp;amp; y\\c &amp;amp; z\end{bmatrix}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/b6326fd70b2a885f537f6d96a1802b9d.png&quot; width=&quot;361&quot; height=&quot;44&quot; title=&quot;\text{Operations} = M = \begin{bmatrix}\text{operation1}\\ \text{operation2}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5\\3 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&quot; alt=&quot;\text{Operations} = M = \begin{bmatrix}\text{operation1}\\ \text{operation2}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5\\3 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A matrix is a single variable representing a spreadsheet of inputs or operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trickiness #1: The reading order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of an input =&amp;gt; matrix =&amp;gt; output flow, we use function notation, like y = f(x) or f(x) = y. We usually write a matrix with a capital letter (F), and a single input column with lowercase (x). Because we have several inputs (A) and outputs (B), they’re considered matrices too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/175ec48c2ca59b2f32e22b646e2cb1c7.png&quot; width=&quot;71&quot; height=&quot;13&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{MA = B}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{MA = B}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/b5d8ab037ca1679d48340a1b33940131.png&quot; width=&quot;397.5&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; title=&quot; \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5\\3 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}a &amp;amp; x\\b &amp;amp; y\\c &amp;amp; z\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3a + 4b + 5c &amp;amp; 3x + 4y + 5z\\ 3a &amp;amp; 3x\end{bmatrix} &quot; alt=&quot; \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5\\3 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}a &amp;amp; x\\b &amp;amp; y\\c &amp;amp; z\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3a + 4b + 5c &amp;amp; 3x + 4y + 5z\\ 3a &amp;amp; 3x\end{bmatrix} &quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trickiness #2: The numbering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix size is measured as RxC: row count, then column count, and abbreviated “m x n” (I hear ya, “r x c” would be easier to remember). Items in the matrix are referenced the same way: a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the ith row and jth column (I hear ya, “i” and “j” are easily confused on a chalkboard). Mnemonics are ok &lt;em&gt;with context&lt;/em&gt;, and here’s what I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RC, like Roman Centurion or RC Cola&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an “L” shape. Count down the L, then across&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does RC ordering make sense? Our operations matrix is 2×3 and our input matrix is 3×2. Writing them together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[Operation Matrix] [Input Matrix]
[operation count x operation size] [input size x input count]
[m x n] [p x q] = [m x q]
[2 x 3] [3 x 2] = [2 x 2]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the matrices touch at the “size of operation” and “size of input” (n = p). They should match! If our inputs have 3 components, our operations should expect 3 items. In fact, we can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; multiply matrices when n = p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output matrix has m operation rows for each input, and q inputs, giving a “m x q” matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fancier Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get comfortable with operations. Assuming 3 inputs, we can whip up a few 1-operation matrices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adder: [1 1 1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Averager: [1/3 1/3 1/3]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Adder” is just a + b + c. The “Averager” is similar: (a + b + c)/3 = a/3 + b/3 + c/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try these 1-liners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First-input only: [1 0 0]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-input only: [0 1 0]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third-input only: [0 0 1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we merge them into a single matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa — it’s the “identity matrix”, which copies 3 inputs to 3 outputs, unchanged. How about this guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[1 0 0]
[0 0 1]
[0 1 0]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reorders the inputs: (x, y, z) becomes (x, z, y).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[2 0 0]
[0 2 0]
[0 0 2]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s an input doubler. We could rewrite him to &lt;code&gt;2*I&lt;/code&gt; (the identity matrix) if we were so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, when we decide to treat inputs as vector coordinates, the operations matrix will transform our vectors. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stata.com/2011/03/03/understanding-matrices-intuitively-part-1/&quot;&gt;few examples&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scale: make all inputs bigger/smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skew: make certain inputs bigger/smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip: make inputs negative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate: make new coordinates based on old ones (East becomes North, North becomes West, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are geometric interpretations of multiplication, and how to warp a vector space. Just remember that vectors are &lt;em&gt;examples&lt;/em&gt; of data to modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Non-Vector Example: Stock Market Portfolios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s practice linear algebra in the real world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input data: stock portfolios with dollars in Apple, Google and Microsoft stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations: the changes in company values after a news event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output: updated portfolios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a bonus output: let’s make a new portfolio listing the net profit/loss from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, we’d track this in a spreadsheet. Let’s learn to think with linear algebra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input vector could be (\$Apple, \$Google, \$Microsoft), showing the dollars in each stock. (Oh! These dollar values could come from &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; matrix that multiplied the number of shares by their price. Fancy that!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4 output operations should be: Update Apple value, Update Google value, Update Microsoft value, Compute Profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visualize the problem. Imagine running through each operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images//linear-algebra-stock-20121002-230152.png&quot; alt=&quot;linear algebra stock example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re setting up the matrix like this, not blindly crunching numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it? Let’s introduce the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a secret iDevice is launched: Apple jumps 20%, Google drops 5%, and Microsoft stays the same. We want to adjust each stock value, using something similar to the identity matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;New Apple     [1.2  0      0]
New Google    [0    0.95   0]
New Microsoft [0    0      1]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Apple value is the original, increased by 20% (Google = 5% decrease, Microsoft = no change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wait! We need the overall profit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total change = (.20 * Apple) + (-.05 * Google) + (0 * Microsoft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final operations matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;New Apple       [1.2  0      0]
New Google      [0    0.95   0]
New Microsoft   [0    0      1]
Total Profit    [.20  -.05   0]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sense? Three inputs enter, four outputs leave. The first three operations are a “modified copy” and the last brings the changes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s feed in the portfolios for Alice \$1000, \$1000, \$1000) and Bob \$500, \$2000, \$500). We can crunch the numbers by hand, or use a Wolfram Alpha (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=++++%7B%7B1.2%2C0%2C0%7D%2C%7B0%2C0.95%2C0%7D%2C%7B0%2C0%2C1%7D%2C%7B.2%2C+-.05%2C+0%7D%7D+.+Transpose%28%5B%7B1000%2C+1000%2C+1000%7D%2C%7B500%2C2000%2C500%7D%5D%29&quot;&gt;calculation&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images//matrix-stock-computation-20121002-231618.png&quot; alt=&quot;matrix stock computation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: Inputs should be in columns, but it’s easier to type rows. The Transpose operation, indicated by t (tau), converts rows to columns.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final numbers: Alice has \$1200 in AAPL, \$950 in GOOG, \$1000 in MSFT, with a net profit of \$150. Bob has \$600 in AAPL, \$1900 in GOOG, and \$500 in MSFT, with a net profit of \$0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening? &lt;strong&gt;We’re doing math with our own spreadsheet.&lt;/strong&gt; Linear algebra emerged in the 1800s yet spreadsheets were invented in the 1980s. I blame the gap on poor linear algebra education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Notes: Solving Simultaneous equations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; use of tables of numbers (not yet a “matrix”) was bookkeeping for linear systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/d233925e50828fb082c4d36fad63a306.png&quot; width=&quot;161.5&quot; height=&quot;71&quot; title=&quot; \begin{aligned} x + 2y + 3z &amp;amp;= 3 \\ 2x + 3y + 1z &amp;amp;= -10 \\ 5x + -y + 2z &amp;amp;= 14 \end{aligned} &quot; alt=&quot; \begin{aligned} x + 2y + 3z &amp;amp;= 3 \\ 2x + 3y + 1z &amp;amp;= -10 \\ 5x + -y + 2z &amp;amp;= 14 \end{aligned} &quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/68fcbe0e409c55cafce74984fbae2ed2.png&quot; width=&quot;211&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; title=&quot; \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3\\2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 1\\5 &amp;amp; -1 &amp;amp; 2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ -10 \\ 14 \end{bmatrix} &quot; alt=&quot; \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3\\2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 1\\5 &amp;amp; -1 &amp;amp; 2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ -10 \\ 14 \end{bmatrix} &quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can avoid hand cramps by adding/subtracting rows in the matrix and output, vs. rewriting the full equations. As the matrix evolves into the identity matrix, the values of x, y and z are revealed on the output side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process, called Gauss-Jordan elimination, saves time. However, linear algebra is mainly about matrix transformations, not solving large sets of equations (it’d be like using Excel for your shopping list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminology, Determinants, and Eigenstuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words have technical categories to describe their use (nouns, verbs, adjectives). Matrices can be similarly subdivided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descriptions like “upper-triangular”, “symmetric”, “diagonal” are the shape of the matrix, and influence their transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;determinant&lt;/strong&gt; is the “size” of the output transformation. If the input was a unit vector (representing area or volume of 1), the determinant is the size of the transformed area or volume. A determinant of 0 means matrix is “destructive” and cannot be reversed (similar to multiplying by zero: information was lost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;eigenvector&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;eigenvalue&lt;/strong&gt; represent the “axes” of the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider spinning a globe: every location faces a new direction, except the poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An “eigenvector” is an input that doesn’t change direction when it’s run through the matrix (it points “along the axis”). And although the direction doesn’t change, the size might. The eigenvalue is the amount the eigenvector is scaled up or down when going through the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My intuition here is weak, and I’d like to explore more. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eigenvectors.gif&quot;&gt;nice diagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCRcnbCsJA&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matrices As Inputs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funky thought: we can treat the operations matrix as inputs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a recipe as a list of commands (&lt;em&gt;Add 2 cups of sugar, 3 cups of flour…&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want the metric version? Take the instructions, treat them like text, and convert the units. The recipe is “input” to modify. When we’re done, we can follow the instructions again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operations matrix is similar: commands to modify. Applying one operations matrix to another gives a new operations matrix that applies &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; transformations, in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If N is “adjust for portfolio for news” and T is “adjust portfolio for taxes” then applying both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TN = X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;means “Create matrix X, which first adjusts for news, and then adjusts for taxes”. Whoa! We didn’t need an input portfolio, we applied one matrix directly to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of linear algebra is representing an entire spreadsheet calculation with a single letter. Want to apply the same transformation a few times? Use &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline-html&quot; alt=&quot;N^2&quot;&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline-html&quot; alt=&quot;N^3&quot;&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can We Use Regular Addition, Please?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, because you asked nicely. Our “mini arithmetic” seems limiting: multiplications, but no addition? Time to expand our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine adding a dummy entry of 1 to our input: (x, y, z) becomes (x, y, z, 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now our operations matrix has an extra, known value to play with! If we want &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; we can write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[1 0 0 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;x + y - 3&lt;/code&gt; would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[1 1 0 -3]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want the geeky explanation? We’re pretending our input exists in a 1-higher dimension, and put a “1” in that dimension. We &lt;em&gt;skew&lt;/em&gt; that higher dimension, which looks like a &lt;em&gt;slide&lt;/em&gt; in the current one. For example: take input (x, y, z, 1) and run it through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[1 0 0 1]
[0 1 0 1]
[0 0 1 1]
[0 0 0 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is (x + 1, y + 1, z + 1, 1). Ignoring the 4th dimension, every input got a +1. We keep the dummy entry, and can do more slides later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini-arithmetic isn’t so limited after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Onward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve overlooked some linear algebra subtleties, and I’m not too concerned. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These metaphors are helping me &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; with matrices, more than the classes I “aced”. I can finally respond to “Why is linear algebra useful?” with “Why are spreadsheets useful?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not, unless you want a tool used to attack nearly every real-world problem. Ask a businessman if they’d rather donate a kidney or be banned from Excel forever. That’s the impact of linear algebra we’ve overlooked: efficient notation to bring spreadsheets into our math equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy math.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is moving EU citizens’ data to US?</title>
<link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2020/02/25/google-is-moving-eu-citizens-data-to-us/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.andreagrandi.it/2020/02/25/google-is-moving-eu-citizens-data-to-us/</guid>
<description>&lt;footer class=&quot;post-info&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tue 25 February 2020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;| in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/provacy.html&quot;&gt;Provacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;| tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/privacy.html&quot;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/google.html&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/gdpr.html&quot;&gt;gdpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/eu.html&quot;&gt;eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/brexit.html&quot;&gt;brexit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/citizens.html&quot;&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/data.html&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/controller.html&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is going on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have heard already, because of &lt;strong&gt;brexit&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-uk-us-data-brexit-gdpr-trump-protection-information-a9348191.html&quot;&gt;Google is moving UK citizens data&lt;/a&gt; from the Northern Ireland data controller to the US one (Google LLC). Leaving the EU, UK citizens are not protected anymore by GDPR, and while this may be unfair, Google is legally allowed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I'm an Italian citizen and I live in Italy, a few days ago I received this email from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2020/02/google-data-controller-email.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2020/02/google-data-controller-email.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's wrong with it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that I'm an &lt;strong&gt;Italian citizen&lt;/strong&gt;, living in &lt;strong&gt;Italy&lt;/strong&gt;. I &lt;strong&gt;have nothing to do with UK&lt;/strong&gt; (even if I lived there for a few years in the past, my account was created from Italy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do they mention &quot;UK leaving EU&quot; to me, if I don't live in UK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to contact them multiple times on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; account on Twitter, but I got no reply at all. I tried to search online and it looks like I'm not alone, they are doing this to many other people: &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/29317992?hl=en&amp;amp;authuser=1&quot;&gt;https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/29317992?hl=en&amp;amp;authuser=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should I do? Is this legally allowed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was an easy way to complain with them, I would have done it already, but I've tried to search on their website (even googling it... no pun intended) but &lt;strong&gt;I couldn't find a single contact form&lt;/strong&gt; to report this issue and of course &lt;strong&gt;they are ignoring&lt;/strong&gt; both Twitter and that forum I linked previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I &lt;strong&gt;report them&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;Privacy Authority&lt;/strong&gt;? If yes, how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full text of the email&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full text of the email I received:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
We’re improving our Terms of Service and making them easier for you to understand. 
The changes will take effect on 31 March 2020, and they won’t impact the way that you use 
Google services. And, because the United Kingdom (UK) is leaving the European Union (EU), 
Google LLC will now be the service provider and the data controller responsible for your 
information and for complying with applicable privacy laws for UK consumer users.

For more details, we’ve provided a summary of the key changes and Frequently asked questions. 
And the next time that you visit Google, you’ll have the chance to review and accept the new Terms. 
At a glance, here’s what this update means for you:

•   Improved readability: While our Terms remain a legal document, we’ve done our best to make them 
    easier to understand, including by adding links to useful information and providing definitions.
•   Better communication: We’ve clearly explained when we’ll make changes to our services 
    (like adding or removing a feature) and when we’ll restrict or end a user’s access. 
    And we’ll do more to notify you when a change negatively impacts your experience on our services.
•   Adding Google Chrome, Google Chrome OS and Google Drive to the Terms: Our improved Terms now 
    cover Google Chrome, Google Chrome OS and Google Drive, which also have service-specific terms 
    and policies to help you understand what’s unique to those services.
•   Your service provider and data controller is now Google LLC: Because the UK is leaving the EU, 
    we’ve updated our Terms so that a United States-based company, Google LLC, is now your service 
    provider instead of Google Ireland Limited. Google LLC will also become the data controller 
    responsible for your information and complying with applicable privacy laws. 
    We’re making similar changes to the Terms of Service for YouTube, YouTube Paid Services and 
    Google Play. These changes to our Terms and privacy policy don’t affect your privacy settings 
    or the way that we treat your information (see the privacy policy for details). 
    As a reminder, you can always visit your Google Account to review your privacy settings and 
    manage how your data is used.

If you’re the guardian of a child under the age required to manage their own Google Account and 
you use Family Link to manage their use of Google services, please note that when you accept 
our new Terms, you do so on their behalf as well, and you may want to discuss these changes with them.

And of course, if you don’t agree to our new Terms and what we can expect from each other as you 
use our services, you can find more information about your options in our Frequently asked questions.

Thank you for using Google’s services.
Your Google team
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;news-2019-winter-update&quot;&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-12-20&quot;&gt;2019-12-20&lt;/time&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;563&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; src=&quot;https://i.postimg.cc/63Wc6vpG/2019-winter-update-candy-cane.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Winter Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new UI skin is available, under &lt;strong&gt;Extras &amp;gt; Themes &amp;gt; Winter&lt;/strong&gt;, featuring winter and holiday icons, festive fonts, and a palette with seasonal colors and peppermint patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; src=&quot;https://jspaint.app/images/winter/tools.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; Jump to any point in the document's history, forwards or backwards, with &lt;strong&gt;Edit &amp;gt; History&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+Shift+Y&lt;/kbd&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on Text in the history view to go back to text editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can return to when a selection existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: these states are skipped over with normal Undo and Redo, so you need to use the History window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branching history: if you undo, and then make changes, you can get back to everything. Future states are preserved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; History is not saved with the autosave. Document history will be lost if you refresh the page, or close the tab, or if the tab crashes, or if you close or restart your browser, or likely if you're just on a phone and the mobile browser loses focus.
&lt;h2&gt;Improved Mobile Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; Use two fingers to pan the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently made it easier to grab handles for resizing things. With that, combined with multitouch panning, JS Paint is much more useable on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;Caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; It's slow on some devices, and parts of the interface are still too small for touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;news-2019-polygon-text-and-select&quot;&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-12-04&quot;&gt;2019-12-04&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handles are now way easier to drag, with extended click targets, similar to Paint from Windows 7. It's not unreasonable to use with a touch screen now! This applies to selections, textboxes, and the main canvas handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resizing things while zoomed in is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/issues/13#issuecomment-562247085&quot;&gt;finally fixed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Text tool now perfectly previews the pixels that will be placed on the canvas. What you see is what you get! Also it retains all browser editing behavior, like spellcheck, using a convoluted, yet elegant overlaying strategy. (I prototyped this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/1j01/wnac09u3/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/1j01/qkvfjn1r/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fill-only option selected, the Polygon tool now previews with inverted lines, like MS Paint does. (When you finish the polygon, the boundary of the shape matches the preview exactly, because it actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; draw a stroke, just the same color as the fill.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;news-2019-zoom-viewport&quot;&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-10-26&quot;&gt;2019-10-26&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; The Magnifier now lets you zoom to a specific location, showing a preview of the new viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when zooming out with the Magnifier, or changing the zoom from the toolbar or menus, the top left corner of the viewport is now kept anchored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, pasting a selection will now go to the top left of the viewport, instead of the entire document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;news-2019-grid-zoom-cursors&quot;&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-10-09&quot;&gt;2019-10-09&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; The Grid. Zoom to 4x+ and use &lt;strong&gt;View &amp;gt; Zoom &amp;gt; Show Grid&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+G&lt;/kbd&gt; to enable. This works with browser zoom as well to provide crisp gridlines even if you zoom in with your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;View &amp;gt; Zoom &amp;gt; Custom Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;, including an actually-custom numerical zoom option, unlike MS Paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;new&quot;&gt;New:&lt;/strong&gt; Dynamic cursors for brush and eraser, so you now have a preview of exactly where the tool will draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in the event that your browser clears canvases to free up memory, you should be more likely to be able to undo to get back to a useful state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;news-2019-async-clipboard&quot;&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-09-21&quot;&gt;2019-09-21&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;JS Paint now lets you copy real image data to the Clipboard, both with keyboard shortcuts and from the Edit menu. This feature is available in Chrome 76+. Other browsers don't support it yet, as of Sep 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: paste a URL of an image, and JS Paint will load it. (This is an alternative to &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Load from URL&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Disney blocks John Oliver’s new episode critical of India’s PM Modi</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/disney-hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-new-episode-critical-of-narendra-modi/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/disney-hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-new-episode-critical-of-narendra-modi/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Disney-owned &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/hotstar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;hotstar&quot;&gt;Hotstar,&lt;/a&gt; India’s largest on-demand video streaming service with &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/12/hotstar-disneys-indian-streaming-service-sets-new-global-record-for-live-viewership/&quot;&gt;more than 300 million users&lt;/a&gt;, has blocked the newest episode of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” that was critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The move has angered many of its customers ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/disney-to-launch-in-india-through-hotstar-on-march-29/&quot;&gt;Disney+’s launch in one of the world’s largest entertainment markets&lt;/a&gt; next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the episode, aired hours before U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, Oliver talked about some of the questionable policies enforced by the ruling government in India and recent protests against “controversial figure” Modi’s citizenship measures. The 19-minute news recap and commentary sourced its information from credible news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIXUhZ2AWs&quot;&gt;available to stream in India&lt;/a&gt; through HBO’s official channel on YouTube, where it has garnered more than 4 million views.

&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople of Star India, which runs Hotstar, and Disney, which acquired the major Indian broadcasting network as part of its Fox deal, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the governing agency which regulates information, broadcasts, movies and the press in India, said the government was not involved in any censorship discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous people in India began speculating on Monday whether Hotstar, which like &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;netflix&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon Prime Video self-censors some content, would stream the new episode at 6am on Tuesday, when it typically makes new episodes of Oliver’s show available on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became quickly apparent on Tuesday that the Disney-owned platform, which has a knack of censoring numerous sensitive subjects, including sketches that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2017/03/16/hotstar-john-oliver-samsung-fire-india/&quot;&gt;make fun of its sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, was not going to risk upsetting the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Amazon also removed from its streaming service in India an episode of the CBS show “Madam Secretary” in which references to Hindu nationalism and extremists were made. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/01/netflix-pulled-an-episode-of-patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj-in-saudi-arabia-after-the-kingdom-complained/&quot;&gt;Netflix also pulled an episode in Saudi Arabia of Hasan Minhaj’s “Patriot Act”&lt;/a&gt; that criticized the kingdom’s crown prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are early risers, wide awake at the crack of dawn. Others are night owls who can’t seem to get to bed until well after midnight and prefer to sleep in. Why is this? An NIH-funded team has some new clues based on evidence showing how a molecular “switch” wired into the biological clocks of extreme early risers leads them to operate on a daily cycle of about 20 hours instead of a full 24-hour, or circadian (Latin for “about a day”), cycle [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new atomic-level details, shared from fruit flies to humans, may help to explain how more subtle clock variations predispose people to follow different sleep patterns. They also may lead to new treatments designed to reset the clock in people struggling with sleep disorders, jet lag, or night-shift work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work, published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLIFE&lt;/em&gt;, comes from Carrie Partch, University of California, Santa Cruz, and her colleagues at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and the University of California, San Diego. It builds on decades of research into biological clocks, which help to control sleeping and waking, rest and activity, fluid balance, body temperature, cardiac rate, oxygen consumption, and even the secretions of endocrine glands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clocks, found in cells and tissues throughout the body, are composed of specialized sets of proteins. They interact in specific ways to regulate transcription of about 15 percent of the genome over a 24-hour period. All this interaction helps to align waking hours and other aspects of our physiology to the 24-hour passage of day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest paper, Partch and her colleagues focused on two core clock components: an enzyme known as casein kinase 1 (CK1) and a protein called PERIOD. Clock-altering mutations in CK1 and PERIOD have been known for many years. In fact, CK1 was discovered in studies of golden hamsters more than 20 years ago after researchers noticed one hamster that routinely woke up much earlier than the others [2,3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the timing of biological clocks is strongly influenced by the rise and fall of the PERIOD protein. This daily oscillation normally takes place over 24 hours, but that’s where CK1 enters the picture. The enzyme adjusts PERIOD levels by chemically modifying the protein at one of two sites, thereby adjusting its stability. When one site is modified, it keeps the protein protected and stable. At the other site, it leaves it unprotected and degradable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these details had been worked out over the years. But, Partch wanted to drill even deeper to answer an essential question: Why does this process normally take 24 hours, which is remarkably slow biochemically? And, what changes in those whose daily cycle gets cut far short?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, her team performed a series of protein structure and biochemical analyses of the CK1 mutation originally found in hamsters, along with several other clock-altering versions of the enzyme found in organisms ranging from flies to humans. What they’ve discovered is a portion of CK1 acts as a switch. When this switch functions normally, it generates a near-perfect 24-hour cycle by keeping PERIOD’s stability just right. In this case, people easily and correctly align their internal clocks to the daily coming and going of daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the switch favors a faster breakdown of the protein, the daily cycle grows shorter and less tightly bound to daylight. For these early risers, it’s a constant struggle to adjust to life in a 24-hour world. Though they try to get in sync, these early risers are never able to catch up. Conversely, a switch that favors a slower breakdown will lengthen the clock, predisposing some to be night owls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such shifts in clock timing can arise from alterations either to the CK1 enzyme or the PERIOD protein. In fact, people with an inherited sleep disorder called &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9242/advanced-sleep-phase-syndrome-familial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; carry a mutation in the PERIOD protein at one of the places that CK1 modifies. The new work shows that this change makes PERIOD more stable by interfering with the enzyme’s ability to mark the protein for degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that makes the CK1 enzyme so fascinating is that it’s extremely ancient. A nearly identical version of the enzyme to the one in humans and hamsters can be found in single-celled green algae! It’s clear that this enzyme and its function in biological clocks is, evolutionarily speaking, rather special. And at one level, that makes total sense—our planet has operated on a 24-hour clock for the entire span of evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versions of CK1 that Partch’s team studied here are rare in people. She now plans to study other variations that turn up in humans much more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her discoveries are sure to offer a fascinating view on these internal clocks and, pardon the pun, how they make us all tick. She hopes they’ll lead to new ways to adjust the clock in those with sleep disorders and even the means to reset the clock in people who regularly travel overseas or work the night shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Partch would like to tap into the crosstalk between biological clocks and the ability of cells to repair their DNA. She wants to see if clock disruptions have any implications for cancer susceptibility. And yes, now’s a good time to find out the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>To get good, go after the metagame</title>
<link>https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who’s currently doing a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Last year, when he was back in Singapore, he went over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University&quot;&gt;Nanyang Technological University&lt;/a&gt; to give an hour-long talk on his recent work. NTU is located far in the west of Singapore, tucked into a bit of no-man’s land; my friend came back six hours later, exhausted but happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What took you so long?” I asked, because we had dinner plans with other friends, and his delayed return meant that he couldn’t join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, the PhD students who attended wanted to talk about the meta. And then I lost track of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called ‘the meta’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the metagame is created when new options are introduced from outside the game. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering&quot;&gt;Magic The Gathering&lt;/a&gt; is famous for having a game system that changes every time the publisher releases a new set of cards. MtG’s metagame is thus a race to see who can discover new card combinations or strategies given the new options. The players who do so are rewarded with easier wins, especially when going up against players who have not adapted to the new possibilities. This makes MtG a game of two levels: the first game is the game you’re playing when you sit down and shuffle cards to battle an opponent; the second game is the race to acquire, analyse and adapt to new cards quicker than your competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/02/wayne-low-OvN4OkhkTLo-unsplash.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;MtG's meta is nothing short of a full commitment.
&lt;p&gt;Metagames like MtG’s also exist in, erm, more physical games. Judo — the sport that I am most familiar with — has a metagame that is shaped by rule changes from the International Judo Federation. A few years after I stopped competing, the IJF banned leg grabs, outlawing a whole class of throws that were part of classical Judo canon — many of them used regularly, even at the top levels of competition. The Judo that exists today is very different from the Judo I left — with changes in gripping strategy, entry styles, and technique combinations — many of them responses to responses to responses to the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ‘response chains’ characterise another type of metagame. Some games don’t have changing rules, and are free from an overwhelming supply of new possibilities. In such games, the meta changes when competitors act &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the space of possibilities of a static game system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this is the excellent board game &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor&quot;&gt;Splendor&lt;/a&gt;. Players buy expensive cards to earn victory points, using poker chips acquired from a central pool. Cheaper cards carry no points but give you a discount on future purchases. The most obvious strategy when you start out in Splendor is to build an ‘engine’ — that is, a tableau of cheap cards that provide you with a large number of discounts, after which you can go after higher-priced, higher-point cards, and win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/02/pic1916682.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Attribution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1916682/splendor&quot;&gt;Duchamp&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-NC-ND 3.0&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;p&gt;The metagame in Splendor emerges the instant someone figures out that you can skip on buying cards for discounts, save up on chips, and go directly after the more expensive cards with points.  Once a player makes this discovery, Splendor changes for the better. It becomes a fluid game of blocking, reserving, purchasing and adapting — with most players doing a combination of ‘building’ and ‘buying’ in response to what &lt;em&gt;everyone else&lt;/em&gt; is doing around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splendor is a good example because there are only two major approaches in the game, and sufficiently competitive gaming groups will discover both of them in a matter of days. But the optimal strategy in Splendor will continue to shift back and forth as a hybrid of the two strategies, depending on the player mix and the changing preferences of the players within your gaming group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is with games, so it is with life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like simpler games, real-world metas come in roughly two flavours: ones that are defined by external changes to the rules of a game, and ones that are shaped by a dynamic equilibrium of competition within a stable system of play. Unlike games, however, real-world domains have no set rules: they are vastly more complicated and interesting, because the rules change only when &lt;em&gt;someone notices the rules have changed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a real world example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last two years working to get better at marketing. If you’re reading this blog, you’ve probably observed the evolution of my content marketing skills first hand. (I grade myself a C+, but more on this in a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who attempts to become really good at marketing must learn the same handful of basic ideas: amongst them, the concept of a funnel and how to measure it, the idea of the buyer’s journey, and the ability to construct and use buyer personas … even if done unrigorously. (The idea of the persona is more important than the form of the persona itself. I know one or two self-taught marketer/entrepreneurs who have an intuitive — and effective! — conception of their ideal buyer in their heads, but are unable to articulate it properly when asked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above these basics are channel-specific skills. These are tactical things: some marketers are better at email marketing, others at content, still others are better at ad-buys and social media. A valuable subset of marketers are able to take an entire team and scale it up for a specific type of product. Whichever it is, these skills are deep and context-specific. Good practitioners know the ‘best practices’ for their specific channels. The better practitioners keep up with the evolution of those best practices. The best marketers … well, the best marketers play the metagame of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote-l&quot;&gt;The metagame of marketing emerges from the fact that all marketing channels decline in efficiency over time.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metagame of marketing emerges from the fact that all marketing channels decline in efficiency over time. To hear the veterans tell it, Google Adsense in the early 2000s was like shooting fish in a barrel. By the 2010s, Adsense had become prohibitively difficult and expensive — its costs driven up by mainstream adoption and increased competition. Similar stories have played out in the Facebook-owned ad ecosystem (think: Facebook, then Instagram, then Instagram stories). The best marketers are therefore the ones who advance the best practices the fastest to keep ahead of the mainstream, or are able to identify and develop playbooks for new channels before the old ones become too inefficient to fight in. The quicker they identify new channels and the longer they keep their playbooks secret, the better the marketing game becomes for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way marketing’s meta is much like MtG’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business also has a meta. Take acquisitions, for instance. Companies have acquired other companies since the beginning of companies — but the game through which this happens has changed significantly over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Singleton, the CEO of Teledyne, famously used share issuances in the 60s to fund Teledyne’s many acquisitions, eventually building it into one of the most valuable conglomerates in America. He then pioneered the use of the share buyback to purchase Teledyne stock cheaply during the bear markets of the 70s, eventually repurchasing 90% of all outstanding shares — including the ones he had issued at high prices in the preceding decade. Investor William Thorndike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint/dp/1422162672&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that Singleton’s track record is in ‘a completely different zip code’ when compared to famous contemporary CEOs like Jack Welch: GE under Welch outperformed the S&amp;amp;P 3.3 times; Teledyne under Singleton outperformed the S&amp;amp;P over 12 times during his tenure as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singleton’s playbook changed the rules of business in ways that still echo today — for instance, share buybacks were treated with derision during Singleton’s time, but are today considered standard entries in the corporate finance playbook. Much later, parts of Singleton’s capital allocation strategy was adapted to a different context by a young man named Warren Buffett, who applied it to an ailing textile manufacturing company named Berkshire Hathaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote-r&quot;&gt;New tools mean new options. New options mean new viable strategies.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 70s, the meta changed again. A man named Michael Milken &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221256711501504X&quot;&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; the use of an obscure financial instrument called the high-yield bond, more popularly known as the ‘junk bond’. He quickly realised that these junk bonds could be used to raise immense amounts of capital for the purpose of corporate takeovers, with little to no cost to the acquiring company. Such ‘leveraged buyouts’ (LBOs) — which issued debt on the target company’s assets, not on the parent company’s books — changed the rules of the takeover game in ways that persist till today. The players that emerged to take advantage of this innovation, the ones who skated to the edge of the meta? We know them today as private equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta in business changes whenever new tools or opportunities emerge in the macro environment. New tools mean new options. New options mean new viable strategies. The Koch brothers adapted pieces of Milken’s LBO playbook when they began expanding their energy empire in the 80s; today, the private equity world is adapting those strategies to survive in a world of excessively cheap capital. The meta changes yet again in response to macro conditions — and on it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain. In MtG, Judo, and Splendor, you cannot play the metagame if you are not already good at the base game. You cannot identify winning strategies in MtG if you don’t do well in current MtG; you cannot adapt old techniques to new rules if you don’t already have effective techniques for competitive Judo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is true in sports is also true in real world domains like marketing and business; it is true even if you are aware of the meta’s existence. The nature of the metagame demands that you play the base game well. It lives on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commoncog.com/blog/expertise-is-just-pattern-matching/&quot;&gt;pattern-matching that comes with expertise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like an obvious thing to say. But as with most such things, the second-order implications are more interesting than the first-order ones. For instance, because expertise is necessary to play the metagame, it is often useful to search for the meta in your domain as a north star for expertise. The way I remind myself of this is to say that I should ‘locate the meta’ whenever I’m at the bottom of a skill tree. Even if I can’t yet participate, searching for the metagame that experts play will usually give me hints as to what skills I must acquire in order to become good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example suffices: in marketing, I have found it very useful to seek out articles or podcasts (but especially podcasts) where practitioners talk about the ways their best practices have changed: “In the past I did X and now it seems it doesn’t work as well, so now we do Y, and I recommend Y.” This tells me that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to learn Y and at least have a passing familiarity with X, because X is what came before and is ‘covered ground’, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to remember the ‘shape’ of the shift. If one such shift happened in the past, more may happen in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More concretely, this is something like a podcast guest saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past (for content marketing) I did roundup posts, but these don’t seem to work as well anymore. So now we do longer, more comprehensive guides, and we cross-launch those to Product Hunt and Hacker News and social media. That seems to work better for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which in turn tells me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to look up as many examples of these ‘comprehensive guides’ to see what the state of the art looks like. From there I can develop an understanding of how they are planned, how they are executed and what success looks like when these things are launched. And I must launch one to verify their effectiveness for myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to try my hand at at least one roundup post, just for the tacit experience of doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I must ask: why did roundup posts fail? Well, because too many people are doing it. (Is this true? How do I verify?) Why might the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; best practice fail, then? I might not know the answer to this because I am a noob, but a side-effect of (1) is that I now know the best practitioners of the guide strategy, and I can observe them to see what changes in their marketing over the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note what I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying, however. I’m not saying that I should actively pursue the meta — this is ineffective, because I am not good enough to play. I cannot execute even if I know where the puck is going. But studying the state of the metagame as it is right now often tells me what I must learn in order to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is, by the way, where my self-grading comes from — I look to the marketers who are playing at the edge of the meta, and I rate myself a C+ in comparison. The ability to make such comparisons is in itself useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uberstuber&quot;&gt;James Stuber&lt;/a&gt; has this thing where he &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesstuber.com/boring-is-fun/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “master boring fundamentals”, and he says it in response to beginners who desire to go after the fancy stuff. Stuber’s quip applies here. To run with his terminology: I’d say that the meta is what you get &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you master boring fundamentals. But observing the state of the current meta often reveals what boring fundamentals you need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly useful if your skill tree has no set syllabus. It is especially useful when you don’t have a coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you balance between locating the meta and chasing boring fundamentals? The short answer to that is to do trial and error. If you can’t master a particular skill, drop back down to its component elements and practice each of them in isolation. If you don’t get good conversions in your content marketing, drop down to practice publishing at a regular cadence. If you can’t get a throw to work, break it down to arms, then legs, then body position, then into one complete motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you learn to do this? I think the best way to do so is to get good at a single, well-structured skill … and preferably, to get this experience as early as possible in one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that the ‘feel’ of improving in pursuit of a meta is strangely similar across skill trees. I noticed this after climbing high enough in the Judo skill tree to see the meta for the first time. Later, when I moved to university, learning the craft of programming became slightly easier. Ditto for content marketing, and email marketing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it is identifying the meta that helps, or if there is some other deep skill transference that’s going on. But I’ve cautiously reached out to friends who have played serious competitive sports when they were younger, and many of them have had similar experiences. There seems to be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in getting good at a skill tree that helps in latter life. I’d like to think it is a function of exposure: once you see the competitive meta at the top of one skill tree, you begin looking for it everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My closest cousin is a software engineer. Recently, his frontend engineering team hired a former musician: someone who had switched from piano to Javascript programming with the help of a bootcamp. He noticed immediately that her pursuit of skills (and the questions she asked) were sharper and more focused than the other engineers he had hired. He thought her prior experience with climbing the skill tree of music had something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin plays &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)&quot;&gt;ultimate frisbee&lt;/a&gt; on the side. To hear him tell it, the metagame in frisbee is more like Splendor: within an unchanging rule system, the dominant strategies are always an adaptation to what your opponent is doing. These strategies sit atop basic throwing and receiving skills. Sometimes, if the opportunity arises, if you understand the metagame well enough, and if you are lucky, your team can get really creative with responses. My cousin loves Ultimate — when he talks about it his eyes light up and he begins gesticulating. It is for him as Judo was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we meet, we talk about the meta a lot because we see parallels between our sports and our respective careers. My cousin has this theory that the people who get really good at one skill will find it easier to get good at a second skill. I believe him. Our experiences bear this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Related: Tobi Lutke offers former pro StarCraft player &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.my/retired-gamer-offered-internship-for-past-starcraft-2-performance-2019-10?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot;&gt;a job at Shopify&lt;/a&gt;; this &lt;a href=&quot;https://nongaap.substack.com/p/shopify-a-starcraft-inspired-business&quot;&gt;fun piece&lt;/a&gt; then analyses Lutke’s strategy as CEO of Shopify through the lens of StarCraft, although it’s clear that the author doesn’t grok StarCraft’s meta &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I both want our kids — when we have them — to get good enough to play in a metagame for one skill, any skill, in whatever game strikes their fancy. It could be Ultimate or Judo or tennis or chess. It could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite&quot;&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2&quot;&gt;Dota&lt;/a&gt;, if those things still exist when they’re old enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is exposure to the meta. My cousin and I both think this exposure is fundamental. We think this because metagames really do exist everywhere in life; you just have to know how to look.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox turns on DoH as default for US users</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Firefox began the rollout of encrypted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS&quot;&gt;DNS over HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; (DoH) by default for US-based users. The rollout will continue over the next few weeks to confirm no major issues are discovered as this new protocol is enabled for Firefox’s US-based users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over two years ago, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2018/06/01/improving-dns-privacy-in-firefox/&quot;&gt;began work to help update and secure one of the oldest parts of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS)&lt;/a&gt;. To put this change into context, we need to briefly describe how the system worked before DoH. DNS is a database that links a &lt;em&gt;human-friendly&lt;/em&gt; name, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;www.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;em&gt;computer-friendly&lt;/em&gt; series of numbers, called an IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.1). By performing a “lookup” in this database, your web browser is able to find websites on your behalf. Because of how DNS was originally designed decades ago, browsers doing DNS lookups for websites — even encrypted https:// sites — had to perform these lookups without encryption. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2018/06/01/improving-dns-privacy-in-firefox/&quot;&gt;described the impact of insecure DNS&lt;/a&gt; on our privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because there is no encryption, other devices along the way might collect (or even block or change) this data too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdt.org/blog/dns-strengthening-the-weakest-link-in-internet-privacy/&quot;&gt;DNS lookups are sent to servers that can spy on your website browsing history&lt;/a&gt; without either informing you or publishing a policy about what they do with that information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the creation of the internet, these kinds of threats to people’s privacy and security were known, but not being exploited yet. Today, we know that unencrypted DNS is not only vulnerable to spying but is being exploited, and so we are helping the internet to make the shift to more secure alternatives. We do this by performing DNS lookups in an encrypted HTTPS connection. This helps hide your browsing history from attackers on the network, helps prevent data collection by third parties on the network that ties your computer to websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our work on DoH began, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maketecheasier.com/enable-dns-over-https-various-browsers/&quot;&gt;many browsers have joined in announcing their plans to support DoH&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve even seen major websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/security/dns-over-tls/&quot;&gt;Facebook move to support a more secure DNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in exactly how DoH protects your browsing history, here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/05/a-cartoon-intro-to-dns-over-https/&quot;&gt;in-depth explainer by Lin Clark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re enabling DoH by default only in the US. If you’re outside of the US and would like to enable DoH, you’re welcome to do so by going to Settings, then General, then scroll down to Networking Settings and click the Settings button on the right. Here you can enable DNS over HTTPS by clicking, and a checkbox will appear. By default, this change will send your encrypted DNS requests to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users have the option to choose between two providers — Cloudflare and NextDNS — both of which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy&quot;&gt;trusted resolvers&lt;/a&gt;. Go to Settings, then General, then scroll down to Network Settings and click the Settings button on the right. From there, go to Enable DNS over HTTPS, then use the pull down menu to select the provider as your resolver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_12513&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-12513&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12513&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;722&quot; height=&quot;869&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection.png 1398w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection-300x361.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection-600x722.png 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection-768x924.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection-1277x1536.png 1277w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DoH-Selection-1000x1203.png 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-12513&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Users can choose between two providers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to explore enabling DoH in other regions, and are working to add more providers as trusted resolvers to our program. DoH is just one of the many privacy protections you can expect to see from us in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the release &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla’s DNS over HTTPs</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2020/02/25/the-facts-mozillas-dns-over-https-doh/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2020/02/25/the-facts-mozillas-dns-over-https-doh/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The current insecure DNS system leaves billions of people around the world vulnerable because the data about where they go on the internet is unencrypted. We’ve set out to change that. In 2017, Mozilla began working on the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol to close this privacy gap within the web’s infrastructure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, Firefox is enabling encrypted DNS over HTTPS by default in the US giving our users more privacy protection wherever and whenever they’re online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoH will encrypt DNS traffic from clients (browsers) to resolvers through HTTPS so that users’ web browsing can’t be intercepted or tampered with by someone spying on the network. The resolvers we’ve chosen to work with so far – &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/12/17/firefox-announces-new-partner-in-delivering-private-and-secure-dns-services-to-users/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare and NextDNS&lt;/a&gt; – have agreed to be part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2019/12/09/trusted-recursive-resolvers-protecting-your-privacy-with-policy-technology/&quot;&gt;Trusted Recursive Resolver program&lt;/a&gt;. The program places strong policy requirements on the resolvers and how they handle data. This includes placing strict limits on data retention so providers- including internet service providers – can no longer tap into an unprotected stream of a user’s browsing history to build a profile that can be sold, or otherwise used in ways that people have not meaningfully consented to. We hope to bring more partners into the TRR program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most new technologies on the web, there has been a healthy conversation about this new protocol. We’ve seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11182&quot;&gt;non-partisan&lt;/a&gt; input, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/encrypted-dns-could-help-close-biggest-privacy-gap-internet-why-are-some-groups&quot;&gt;privacy experts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/dns-over-https-big-privacy-win-behind-acronym-soup/&quot;&gt;other organizations&lt;/a&gt; all weigh in. And because we value transparency and open dialogue this conversation has helped inform our plans for DoH. We are confident that the research and testing we’ve done over the last two years has ensured our roll-out of DoH respects user privacy and makes the web safer for everyone. Through DoH and our trusted recursive resolver program we can begin to close the data leaks that have been part of the domain name system since it was created 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things we think are important to know about our deployment of DNS over HTTPs.&lt;/p&gt;
