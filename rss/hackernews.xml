<title>Google recommends all North America employees work from home</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-google-north-america-employees-work-from-home-2020-3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-google-north-america-employees-work-from-home-2020-3</guid>
<description>&lt;ul class=&quot;summary-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google has advised all of its employees in North America to work remotely in response to coronavirus concerns, the company confirmed to Business Insider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google had previously instructed workers at its offices in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-google-amazon-twitter-microsoft-headquarters-close-coronavirus-2020-3&quot;&gt;the San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/google-dublin-coronavirus-work-from-home-twitter-coinbase-2020-3&quot;&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, and Seattle to avoid going into the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of Google's 100,000-plus worldwide employees are based in North America, and the policy change represents one of the most sweeping remote-work orders in response to the outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company is the latest in a string of tech giants, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-apple-tim-cook-tells-office-workers-work-from-home-2020-3&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-work-from-home-coronavirus-seattle-area-bay-area2020-3&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, to advise its employees to avoid going into the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet&quot;&gt;Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is recommending that all of its tens of thousands of North American employees work from home in its latest move to try and protect its employees from the growing coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Silicon Valley-based search giant sent out a memo to its employees informing them that it was changing its policies to recommend all workers who are able to work remotely do so until at least April 10, sources familiar with the matter said. A Google spokesperson confirmed the order via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of Google's 100,000-plus employees work in North America, and the policy change represents one of the most sweeping remote-work orders of any company in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. (Google's offices will remain open to accommodate those workers who are able to do their roles only from the office.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has sickened more than 113,000 people and killed nearly 4,000, and it is causing mounting disruption around the globe — disrupting supply chains and forcing the closure of corporate offices and major events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many major US tech companies have instituted remote-work policies for at least some of their employees, including Apple and Facebook. Industry events including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-concerns-cancel-mobile-world-congress-mwc-smartphone-conference-2020-2&quot;&gt;Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-cancels-f8-coronavirus-covid-2020-2&quot;&gt;Facebook's F8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cancels-io-conference-coronavirus-concerns-2020-3&quot;&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; have been canceled, and on Friday, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/sxsw-2020-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-3&quot;&gt;South by Southwest tech and culture festival&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, Texas, was also canceled.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Google previously gave its employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it is headquartered, the option of working from home. Last week, it also barred all of its employees from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-covid-19-google-bans-all-employee-international-business-travel-2020-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;slack-kit-tooltip&quot;&gt;traveling internationally&lt;/a&gt; after an employee in its Zurich office &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employee-tests-positive-for-novel-coronavirus-company-restricts-travel-2020-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;slack-kit-tooltip&quot;&gt;tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has said it will compensate hourly contract workers for the hours they would have worked if it weren't for the coronavirus and also created a fund to pay sick leave for contract workers or vendors who can't come into work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you work at Google or Alphabet and have a story to share?&lt;/strong&gt; Contact this reporter using a nonwork device via encrypted messaging app Signal (+1-650-636-6268), encrypted email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:robaeprice@protonmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;slack-kit-tooltip&quot;&gt;robaeprice@protonmail.com&lt;/a&gt;), standard email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rprice@businessinsider.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;slack-kit-tooltip&quot;&gt;rprice@businessinsider.com&lt;/a&gt;), Telegram/Wickr/WeChat (robaeprice), or Twitter DM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robaeprice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;slack-kit-tooltip&quot;&gt;@robaeprice&lt;/a&gt;). PR pitches by standard email only, please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MIT moves all classes online for the rest of the semester</title>
<link>https://web.mit.edu/covid19/update-from-president-l-rafael-reif-to-the-mit-community/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://web.mit.edu/covid19/update-from-president-l-rafael-reif-to-the-mit-community/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;March 10, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update from President L. Rafael Reif to the MIT Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subject: A significant new step in response to COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the members of the MIT community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote last week, we understood that our approach to campus life would need to change, broadly and in many details. As COVID-19 continues to spread, and as public health leaders have offered more definitive guidance, we have come to see that our community has a significant role to play in the concerted public health response to this regional, national and global threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal public health officials advise that to slow a spreading virus like COVID-19, the right time for decisive action is before it is established on our campus. Therefore, &lt;u&gt;although the risk to those on campus remains low&lt;/u&gt;, given the ongoing spread in our state and elsewhere, we are now escalating our institutional response to protect our entire community – staff, students, post-docs and faculty – and the many communities we belong to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall plan is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;All classes are cancelled for the week of Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20&lt;/u&gt;. Because the following week is spring break, this will allow faculty and instructors two weeks to organize a full transition to online instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Online instruction&lt;/u&gt;, which some units are already experimenting with this week, &lt;u&gt;will begin for all classes on Monday, March 30,&lt;/u&gt; and continue for the remainder of the semester.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Undergraduates should not return to campus after spring break&lt;/u&gt;. Undergraduates who live in an MIT residence or fraternity, sorority or independent living group (FSILG) must begin packing and departing this Saturday, March 14. We are requiring undergraduates to depart from campus residences no later than noon on Tuesday, March 17. &lt;em&gt;Please see below for details on graduate students&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Classes will continue this week&lt;/u&gt; as we continue to prepare for this transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These steps obviously disrupt the usual patterns of the semester for thousands of you. You will understandably have many questions. This letter offers our initial answers. I hope we can all be patient and respectful with one another as we cope with this extraordinary challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aiming to reduce risk for all of us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taking this dramatic action to protect the health and safety of everyone at MIT – staff, students, post-docs and faculty – and because MIT has an important role in slowing the spread of this disease. As at any residential college, our residence halls and FSILGs put students in close quarters. What’s more, the intense and free-flowing collaboration MIT is known for comes with close contact and shared spaces, equipment and supplies. These characteristics, which we cherish in normal times, increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading on our campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan follows directly from state health guidance that universities take steps to reduce the density of the population on campus and increase social distancing. By doing so, we are doing our part to reduce the spread of the disease overall, while directly reducing risk for our own community – for departing students, of course, but equally for those of us who continue to work on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of last night, in all of Massachusetts, there were 41 confirmed or presumptive cases, 32 of them stemming from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/08/metro/mass-health-officials-report-28-cases-coronavirus-sunday/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;local conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt;. Four are related to travel, and five are under investigation. We also now know that in late February, we had a recruiter at MIT Sloan who was later diagnosed with COVID-19. This ended up being a low-risk situation for our community – but it might have turned out differently, so we consider this a cautionary tale. (You may &lt;a href=&quot;https://medical.mit.edu/news/2020/01/2019-novel-coronavirus-updates-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these realities, our teams have been working overtime to prepare the campus for extraordinary measures, which we are now taking. Here are some of the details. Further guidance will be coming on a variety of topics in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOR MIT STAFF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing the density of the campus population is a public health measure intended not only to protect our students but to reduce risk for those of us who remain here, including our dedicated staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;I ask that all of you begin to work with your supervisors to experiment with changes your unit could make to increase social distancing&lt;/u&gt;. While more detailed guidance for staff will be forthcoming, our aim is to ensure the safety of the whole community, particularly those who may fall into categories of greater risk; we ask that supervisors be flexible, adaptable and sensitive to conditions in each unit. In case working remotely ultimately becomes necessary, all units should start planning to make that broadly feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;For now, MIT operations will continue as normal,&lt;/u&gt; and staff should report to work unless they are sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;If you feel sick, it is of the utmost importance that you stay home&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;If you have an underlying medical condition or vulnerability, please discuss the risks with your healthcare providers.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;We also ask that supervisors consider evolving conditions&lt;/u&gt; in the wider community that staff may have to contend with, including sick family members, school closures and other potential effects of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOR MIT STUDENTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNDERGRADUATE HOUSING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undergraduates who live on campus must begin packing and moving out of their residences by this Saturday, March 14. This also applies to students in our FSILGs. You will be required to leave by noon on Tuesday, March 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For first-years, sophomores and juniors: Please pack your belongings and make plans to travel home or to another location off-campus &lt;u&gt;as if you do not expect to return here until the fall semester.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students poised to graduate: Please pack as if you will not return to MIT for classes. No decision has yet been made about this year’s Commencement ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you cope with the sudden new challenge, we will be assisting the residence halls to make sure you have ample boxes for packing, bins for moving belongings, dumpsters for disposing of trash and options for storage. We will also help the FSILGs handle this process, and they should work closely with their alumni corporation and the FSILG office. You will receive more detail in the coming days about move-out resources and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERMISSION FOR UNDERGRADUATES TO REMAIN ON CAMPUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will consider limited exceptions to allow certain undergraduate students to remain on campus. However, to remain, you must receive official permission. Students will receive direct communications about this in a follow-up email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will review such requests case by case, and as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptions may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;International students who have concerns that they would not be allowed to return to MIT due to visa issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International students who will have difficulty returning to their home country if it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hard-hit by COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students who do not have a home to go to, or for whom going home would be unsafe given the circumstances of their home country or homelife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that being asked to leave campus may pose a serious financial hardship for certain individuals. Students will receive a follow up communication on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Any student who is permitted to stay may be required to relocate to another building on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRADUATE STUDENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most graduate students live in apartments – as opposed to dorm-style living with shared facilities – we are not requiring graduate students to move off campus. However, if your individual living circumstances present a higher risk, we may relocate you elsewhere on campus. Graduate Resident Advisors (GRAs) will not be asked to leave campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with MIT staff, we ask that all research groups take steps to increase social distancing in the workplace, without departing from normal Institute and departmental lab safety procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate students who can work remotely and who can arrange another place to live away from campus are strongly encouraged to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DINING OPERATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, dining operations will continue with some slight modifications. Self-service stations will be closed; stations will be full service or offered as grab and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLASSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;We will hold classes as scheduled this week&lt;/u&gt;; lectures with more than 150 students will go online as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over these few days, we encourage all faculty and instructors to begin preparing for and &lt;a href=&quot;http://teachremote.mit.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experimenting with online and remote learning if possible&lt;/a&gt;. If you teach a class that is large, though under the 150-person limit, we ask that you be flexible in your attendance policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;All classes will resume in an online/remote format on Monday, March 30&lt;/u&gt;, and continue to the normally scheduled end of the term, including finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing plans for the timing of any final assignments and exams for first half-term subjects that were scheduled for the week of March 16-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share more details as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open Source Initiative bans co-founder, Eric S Raymond</title>
<link>https://lunduke.com/posts/2020-03-9-b/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lunduke.com/posts/2020-03-9-b/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Eric S Raymond (often known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&quot;&gt;ESR&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&quot;&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, and co-founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative&quot;&gt;Open Source Intiative&lt;/a&gt;) was banned from the Open Source Intiative (the “OSI”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Raymond was banned from the mailing lists used to organize and communicate with the OSI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an organization to ban their founder from communicating with the group (such as via a mailing list) is a noteworthy move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when we have seen other founders (of multiple Free and Open Source related initiatives) pushed out of the organizations they founded (such as with Richard Stallman being compelled to resign from the Free Software Foundation, or the attempts to remove Linus Torvalds from the Linux Kernel – both of which happened within the last year) it seems worth taking a deeper look at what, specifically, is happening with the Open Source Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't wish to tell any of you what you should think about this significant move. As such I will simply provide as much of the relevant information as I can, show the timeline of events, and reach out to all involved parties for their points of view and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond made the following statement, on February 27, 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609&quot;&gt;on his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I – OSI’s co-founder and its president for its first six years – was kicked off their lists for being too rhetorically forceful in opposing certain recent attempts to subvert OSD clauses 5 and 6. This despite the fact that I had vocal support from multiple list members who thanked me for being willing to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be news to anyone that there is an effort afoot to change – I would say corrupt – the fundamental premises of the open-source culture. Instead of meritocracy and “show me the code”, we are now urged to behave so that no-one will ever feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect – the intended effect – is to diminish the prestige and autonomy of people who do the work – write the code – in favor of self-appointed tone-policers. In the process, the freedom to speak necessary truths even when the manner in which they are expressed is unpleasant is being gradually strangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is bad for us. Very bad. Both directly – it damages our self-correction process – and in its second-order effects. The habit of institutional tone policing, even when well-intentioned, too easily slides into the active censorship of disfavored views.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what, exactly, prompted this extreme measure? What could happen that would be so problematic that an organization would ban their founder (and one of the most well known individuals in the Open Source world)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the Open Source Initiative keeps a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/&quot;&gt;public archive&lt;/a&gt; of all the posts to their mailing lists. I did what any journalist would do in this scenario… I started reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn't have to go very far back through the archive, either. Turns out the first post (in a very long time) from Raymond was 3 short days before he was banned (and before the blog post he penned above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February 24th, 2020. Raymond posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021271.html&quot;&gt;the following&lt;/a&gt; to an OSI mailing list with the title “A wild co-founder appears”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After twenty years of staying off this list, I have joined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't, until now, because whenever I checked in on this list the regulars seemed to be doing the job I expected them to do quite competently. And I had enough of an “I can't be everywhere, dammit!” problem without adding to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are two recent developments I find concerning that have convinced me I need to weigh in. Please pay careful attention, as I am not making this choice [lightly].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start individual threads for both issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed from there were several posts by Eric Raymond over the next two days – having conversations on multiple topics relating to Open Source licensing and how the OSI should handle potential revoking of certification of licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the messages had strong disagreements over OSI policy. However, I was unable to find any messages, from Raymond (or anyone else) that would (based on my understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/codeofconduct/licensing&quot;&gt;the Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; that the OSI has adopted for their mailing lists) constitute a banning… of a founder or of any regular member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on February 26, 2020, “&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Moderator@OpenSource.org&quot;&gt;Moderator@OpenSource.org&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021333.html&quot;&gt;posted the following statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSI Board is aware that some offensive emails have been sent to this list. The OSI does not tolerate deliberately divisive or disrespectful messages from any quarter. We have already taken moderation actions to this effect and we will apply further sanctions if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No further details were provided, making this difficult to verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day (February 27, 2020), Josh Berkus (a Red Hat employee and regular speaker at Open Source conferences) &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021356.html&quot;&gt;posted the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESR's “sharp language” is not an attempt to persuade. It is an attempt to intimidate opponents; to “win” an argument by making others afraid to participate. Indeed, even today OSI mailing list composition is entirely folks with enough privilege to be resistant to personal attacks. That's a sad, terrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not “free speech” when it's an attempt to shout others down so that they have no voice. It's something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, not one of ESR's points is original or even original to this list. In his absence, not one of the ideas he so “colorfully” expressed will be lost. In the meantime, we're missing the input of so many people who will not participate in OSI because of our tolerance for wholly uncivilized behavior like his posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed shortly thereafter (February 28, 2020) by Pamela Chestek (a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/docs/board-annotated&quot;&gt;the OSI Board&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021350.html&quot;&gt;who posted the following&lt;/a&gt; to the OSI Mailing list with the title “Member conduct”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an incident on Open Source Initiative mailing lists, the Board has removed a subscriber from both the License-Review and License-Discuss mailing lists for repeatedly violating the Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board took steps to mitigate the issue and began deliberating immediately after the incident, reached a decision early this morning, and notified the subscriber of the decision this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board regrets that some material was published that should not have been, in spite of our best moderation efforts. We ask for all mailing list participants to be cautious with the use of CC, BCC, and Reply-All fields in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have failed in this instance, the OSI continues to work on making the email lists safe environments where all people and viewpoints are greeted with an open mind and treated with dignity and respect. OSI has a broad constituency and that remains a fundamental asset to our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be following up in the coming weeks with a more general public statement about the current state of our moderation efforts, as well as relevant projects that are in flight. We are grateful for the feedback we’ve received and welcome further input on our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that our continued efforts will bring more underrepresented voices to the table, and that those who left will feel safe returning. We want you all with us on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to the Board and leadership of the Open Source Initiative for comment, and to provide the quote from Eric Raymond that prompted the decission to ban him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the writing of this article, I had not yet received any reply from the Open Source Initiative leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also reached out to Eric S Raymond to see if he could shed any further light on the situation and get his views. What follows are his complete responses to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunduke&lt;/strong&gt;: Any idea what statement/email you sent that specifically caused the banning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric S Raymond&lt;/strong&gt;: “They never told me specifically which message was the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they haven't publicly admitted to banning me, though I got an email telling me I had been banned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunduke&lt;/strong&gt;: I've also asked the OSI board the same question (and others)… but have yet to hear back from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric S Raymond&lt;/strong&gt;: “Don't hold your breath waiting. Full political ass-covering mode will be in effect now, and you can quote me on that. These people are an utter disgrace to the ideals on which I founded OSI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunduke&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you see as the root cause of the issues you see with the OSI (which you call out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609&quot;&gt;your blog post&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric S Raymond&lt;/strong&gt;: The fetishization of ‘nice’ behavior, where ‘nice’ ends up defined as being any behavior some self-appointed censor doesn't like. Usually (and in this case) accompanied by a lot of bafflegab about “inclusion” and “diversity” so thay anyone who isn't a fan of the new, censorious rules can be cast as some sort of bigot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunduke&lt;/strong&gt;: How would you go about fixing those issues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric S Raymond&lt;/strong&gt;: Abolish “Codes of Conduct” and all the Orwellian doublespeak that goes with them. It's less bad that people sometimes got their feelings hurt than it is to institutionalize a means by which dissenting opinions are crushed under the rubric of “not nice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a step back, for a moment, and look at thing from a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are we at, as of the writing of this article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric S Raymond (ESR), one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative, has been banned from OSI mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No verifiable reason has been given, by the OSI, for the banning. Based on the timeline, presumably the offending message (or messages) would have been sent in the two day window between February 24th and February 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Source Initiative has not responded to a request for clarification or comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps interestingly, the Open Source Initiative is right in the middle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/elections&quot;&gt;an election for a few of their Board seats&lt;/a&gt;. With such clear and strong conflicts happening between a founder of the OSI – and some of the current leadership of the OSI – it will be interesting to see what direction the current OSI leadership and membeship choose to go in.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Open Source Initiative bans co-founder, Eric S Raymond</og:title>
<og:description>Last week, Eric S Raymond (often known as ESR, author of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and co-founder of the Open Source Intiative) was banned from the Open Source Intiative (the “OSI”). Specifically, Raymond was banned from the mailing lists used to organize and communicate with the OSI. For an organization to ban their founder from communicating with the group (such as via a mailing list) is a noteworthy move.</og:description>

&lt;p class=&quot;my-2 text-sm&quot;&gt;The sequence of retrieving data from an API, showing a loading placeholder, and then displaying the result is so common that Redwood codifies it into a declarative code pattern, resulting in simple and readable code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;my-2 text-sm&quot;&gt;We call them &lt;strong&gt;cells&lt;/strong&gt; and they contain the GraphQL query, loading, empty, error, and success states, each one rendering itself automatically depending on what state your cell is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t panic but do not brush off the public health warnings of Coronavirus. Emerging consensus is that containment might have been possible a few weeks ago, but is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uwmnewsroom/status/1236020906956189696&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;no longer realistic&lt;/a&gt;. Although China &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1236344865924972545&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bought us all time, we wasted it&lt;/a&gt;. We are entering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1235983934187544578&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pandemic phase which will be followed by seasonal recurrence of the disease&lt;/a&gt; unless and until we have a vaccine (which may still be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/05/coronavirus-trump-vaccine-rhetoric-121796?nname=playbook&amp;amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;amp;nrid=0000014e-f0fe-dd93-ad7f-f8ff7e290000&amp;amp;nlid=630318&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;18-24 months away, if we are lucky&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;This_is_Not_Normal_Flu_-_Not_Even_in_the_Best_Case&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is Not Normal Flu — Not Even in the Best Case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimate of 3.5% is an average across age groups, and they have provided large surveillance data as evidence &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; high numbers of asymptomatic cases. There is very strong consensus that those aged 60+ and those with underlying conditions are the most impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-25&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mortality.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mortality.png 882w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mortality-300x235.png 300w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mortality-768x603.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the epidemic, there was hope that 3.5 percent was grossly overestimated, however as evidence continues to emerge, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dwindling support for that hope&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers out of South Korea are so far the most optimistic in the world (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1236914078632812544&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;0.7% cases were fatal&lt;/a&gt;); however, a) the South Korean population is younger on average and b) South Korea (in contrast to the USA) have been doing everything right from the earliest stages of the outbreak: they have done massive roll out of testing coupled with radical transparency, public support and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1234524871226482688&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;brilliant drive-through testing!&lt;/a&gt; If this strain of Coronavirus is like other viruses, aggressive measures that reduce transmission, may also lower the average ‘dose’ of viral particles that cause any given case; this might reduce the average severity of disease and decrease overall death rates. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even IF the true Covid-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as it is so far with the Diamond Princess&lt;/a&gt;), that would already be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ten times higher than a typical seasonal flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-26 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-flu-comparison.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-flu-comparison.png 1250w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-flu-comparison-300x71.png 300w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-flu-comparison-1024x242.png 1024w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-flu-comparison-768x182.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px&quot;/&gt;“The 61,099 flu-related deaths in the U.S. during the severe flu season of 2017-2018 amounted to 0.14% of the estimated 44.8 million cases of influenza-like illness. There were also an estimated flu-related 808,129 hospitalizations, for a rate of 1.8%. Assume a Covid-19 outbreak of similar size in the U.S., multiply the death and hospitalization estimates by five or 10, and you get some really scary numbers: 300,000 to 600,000 deaths, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;4 million to 8 million hospitalizations in a country that has 924,107 staffed hospital beds&lt;/a&gt;” [for all illnesses combined].For most people, infection results in a mild but still transmissible illness; &lt;strong&gt;that is how it spreads.&lt;/strong&gt; Those that get severe illness are hit really hard. Mortality is not the full picture: Italy reports that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;10% of cases need not just hospitalization but also ICU care&lt;/a&gt; – and they need that care over a period of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/07/how-doctors-treat-sickest-coronavirus-patients/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;3-6 weeks&lt;/a&gt;. This is unsustainable.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Keep_the_Main_Thing_the_Main_Thing_FlattenTheCurve&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlattenTheCurve?src=hashtag_click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#FlattenTheCurve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of ink has been spilled on speculation about the “true” rate; however we are still in the early phase of the pandemic and it could take years to precisely determine the rate. BUT we know that it is somewhere &lt;strong&gt;between .5% and 4 percent mortality; this range is more than adequate evidence to warrant decisive, immediate, large-scale preventive action&lt;/strong&gt;. Far and away, the most important thing to do is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flatten the curve of the epidemic&lt;/a&gt; so that our health systems can cope and to give time for the scientists to research vaccines and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;It_is_Here&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is Here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that the virus is already in your city / town / workplace / church / etc. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1234879748083503105&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;almost certainly is “here” and is simply not yet detected&lt;/a&gt; due to the shortage of tests. Moreover there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/06/812833596/coronavirus-14-deaths-now-in-u-s-new-cases-in-maryland-colorado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;6 states that still don’t have a single lab ready to carry out the test&lt;/a&gt; even if they had one in their hands. Estimates from Italy are that in the early outbreak, the number of actual infections was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1236004937529798659&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;four times the number of cases than it was possible to confirm at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Cryptic transmission in the community was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1236096904678633472&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;happening for weeks before it was detected in Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. Seattle and Stanford are doing an amazing job of getting up to speed with their own testing kits; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UWVirology/status/1236017803162873856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;about 5-7% of tests in Seattle are positive&lt;/a&gt; and anyone (with a doctor’s indication) can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-27&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/seattle-flu-research.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;698&quot; height=&quot;572&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/seattle-flu-research.png 698w, https://www.flattenthecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/seattle-flu-research-300x246.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the sake of public health, University of Washington are publishing these results). So far only UW and Stanford have been moving ahead with their own (non-CDC) testing; both of these institutions have mandated that in-person classes be moved to distance learning alternatives. That speaks for itself; more universities should follow suit. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryanaboyd/status/1236009378295103488&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;professors need the technology and support to make this switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education communities that are resource-poor (without laptops or internet) would have the hardest time doing this switch. So let’s start with those universities (and disciplines) for whom this switch is not such a major hardship. There is no one-size-fits-all intervention, but speed is key. Professors, please don’t wait for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/06/roundup-weeks-news-about-colleges-and-coronavirus?utm_content=buffera0fc5&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;utm_campaign=IHEbuffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;university administration to make the decision campus wide&lt;/a&gt;. Move to a distance-based option of your own accord. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR7IEgdisO6JtmELs07uUsSSu2Yox86GJY9wGV6mBjA/edit#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Check out these tips for teaching online in a pinch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The_US_Healthcare_System_is_Not_Well_Enough_Prepared_No_One_Is&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The US Healthcare System is Not Well Enough Prepared. No One Is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA, our health care capacity is under 1 million staffed beds; this is not adequate to accommodate the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hospitalizations we are expected to see (4-8 million)&lt;/a&gt;. Johns Hopkins University did a 3-year global survey of pandemic preparedness. Although the USA ranked at the top of the countries, even the US only &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/pandemic-influenza-and-major-disease-outbreak-preparedness-in-us--7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;scored a 42 out of 100.&lt;/a&gt; We simply don’t have the equipment, training, or messaging in place and we need to ramp up fast. No one does. That is why your choices today matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those of us with Italian colleagues in the north (hit hardest) know they have exceptional physicians, infectious disease docs and immunologists. And effectively universal care. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drkomanduri/status/1236720751073546240&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;This is not a developing-world tale that is irrelevant for the US situation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Relative_to_Other_Countries_US_Labor_and_Healthcare_Policies_are_a_Perfect_Storm_for_Pandemics&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative to Other Countries, US Labor and Healthcare Policies are a Perfect Storm for Pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zero universal guaranteed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/for-how-long-are-workers-guaranteed-paid-sick-leave&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;paid sick leave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even among those *with* paid sick leave, the covered time frame is often on the order of days, not the weeks adequate to account for prolonged illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero guaranteed paid family leave to care for sick members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero guaranteed financial or operational support for people who should self-quarantine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iKaylaReed/status/1237006777474060294&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;People are therefore ignoring quarantine because they need to eat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are uninsured. Given where things are right now (cryptic transmission and no available vaccine), the insurance companies have a moral obligation but have no financial incentive to improve testing and ensure access to care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the USA insurance is tied to their employment, so when they get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy. In a pandemic year this is devastating for an economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never has there been a clearer case for single-payer health care as a public good. The voting public in the US need to care as much about “keeping their doctor” as they do about keeping their doctor alive. Doctors worldwide are getting pummeled on the frontlines of this crisis, the lack of protective equipment is causing them to get infected, and themselves unable to get the care they need. For a personal lens on this, have a look &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236467114933813248&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but this is by no means unique; the accounts are flooding in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;authoritarianism is also bad for pandemic control&lt;/a&gt; since it stifles the expertise and transparency required to make the best use of resources. Examples of this are most acutely seen in places like China (earliest in the epidemic), and now Iran. Statistically it is impossible that Turkey or Russia have no cases. The fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1236876030138294272&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CDC site is not being updated over weekends&lt;/a&gt; does not bode well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;There_is_Hope_Youre_It_Thats_the_Work&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is Hope. You’re It. That’s the Work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can help by following as much as possible of the following guidance. The earlier the precautions are taken, the more precautions are taken, the more lives are saved. It is that simple. Expect yesterday’s under responders to be today’s over-responders. Resist the urge to ricochet or give up hope. The key is to stay calm and do the steady work of infection control and urge others to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a dear friend in Beijing “Steer as far away from the fear and hysteria that might be hitting your towns. Use wisdom but don’t allow it to become an empty excuse for not loving your fellow humans. Choose generosity instead of hoarding. And on those really hard days (or maybe after watching too many news reports) turn up the music and dance! Celebrate the goodness! It’s there, it will remain and you can be a catalyst for it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Do&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;WASH_YOUR_HANDS&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; WASH YOUR HANDS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;20 seconds with soap and warm water. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/coronavirus-prevention-10-awesome-tunes-to-sing-while-you-wash-your-hands/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=owned_echobox_tw_m&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1583369786&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Here are great options&lt;/a&gt; of songs to sing to help you pass the time. Unlike some really stubborn viruses (like polio), viruses in the coronavirus family typically don’t survive longer than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;few hours on most surfaces hard surfaces; though it can be up to days. Bleach or ethanol are more effective at decontaminating surfaces than they are disinfecting human skin&lt;/a&gt;. So don’t hoard the hand sanitizer, that should be used only when you do not have any access to a soap and water sink. At a restaurant? Wash your hands. At school? Wash your hands. Vigorous handwashing with soap really is vital to reduce transmission; the awesome science of why is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549305189597189&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;If you do nothing else at all, do wash your hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;STAY_CONNECTED_BUT_AVOID_CROWDS&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; STAY CONNECTED, BUT AVOID CROWDS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is best to stand at a distance from people. 6 feet or more is safest from infectious droplet spread. The higher your underlying risk factors (age, recent major surgery, cancer, immunocompromised, asthma, diabetes, etc), the more you should avoid crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC has recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://fox8.com/news/coronavirus/cdc-older-adults-should-stay-at-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to-coronavirus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;older adults ‘stay at home as much as possible’&lt;/a&gt;. But keep in mind that over the longer term, this isolation could have negative impacts on many people’s mental health. Cultivating meaningful relationships is a well established but under-appreciated determinant for all health outcomes. So DO see the people you love, but consider doing so via lower-risk activities. For instance, go for a walk outside with a smaller group of people rather than attending an event indoors. Go to the beach. Ride bikes. Golf. Picnic more. This is not going away in one week, so pace yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;LOWER_YOUR_OVERALL_RISK_WITH_EVERYDAY_CHOICES&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;LOWER YOUR OVERALL RISK WITH EVERYDAY CHOICES&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, making safer every-day choices on average — not just this week but for the next several months — can flatten the curve. Continue to support your local economy, but go off peak; staggering by even 15 minutes can reduce crowding. Everything from restaurants to art museums to public transport will be less risky (and more pleasant!) off peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-contact sports are better than contact ones. E.g., Tennis is better than (&amp;gt;) rugby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takeout &amp;gt; eat on restaurant patio &amp;gt; eat in restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video streaming options &amp;gt; movie theatre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside events &amp;gt; inside events (small events also are better than large ones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery/curbside pickup &amp;gt; going in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote observance &amp;gt; religious service attendance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birthday cupcakes &amp;gt; birthday cake (if candle blowing is involved)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink your coffee/beer/cocktail at a table instead &amp;gt; drink your coffee/beer/cocktail at the bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live performers are going to be hard hit economically. Consider supporting their work on Patreon, directly via PayPal, or attend only the smaller shows. Promote them on social media. Buy their work directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;GET_YOUR_FLU_SHOT_AND_IF_YOURE_60_PNEUMONIA_VACCINE_TOO&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; GET YOUR FLU SHOT (AND IF YOU’RE 60+, PNEUMONIA VACCINE TOO &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better late than never. The flu vaccine won’t protect you at all against Coronavirus. However it DOES reduce your likelihood of contracting flu. And therefore your likelihood of needing to be hospitalized, which also reduces your chances of contracting Coronavirus while you are there. If you’re 60+ get your pneumonia vaccine as well for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are hot spots for transmission; get your vaccinations at a pharmacy rather than at the doctor. Find ways to do your physical therapy at home if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine professionals, this is your time to save the day. For everyone’s benefit but especially those in rural areas who are hard hit and without easy access to medical care. &lt;a href=&quot;http://zoom.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Zoom.us&lt;/a&gt; was developed precisely for telemedicine applications [some additional resources needed here about how to get docs up to speed safely and to protect patient privacy].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JHU is developing resources here for hospital staff and administrators; more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-containment-dr-jon-lapook-60-minutes-2020-03-08/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This illness can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;start slow and accelerate suddenly&lt;/a&gt;. If you are away from home when it does, you’re away from the systems that could keep you fed and cared for even if you turn out not to have a bad case. Even if you remain healthy, you could end up being quarantined. It is at best boring, at worst &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alankilbourne2/status/1236541651692204033&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;terrible conditions&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention potentially really expensive. You could risk getting infected even if you are careful. Travel history is increasingly irrelevant to risk, especially because we are flying a bit blind with the lack of testing, but the available data of confirmed infections is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from Johns Hopkins University.

&lt;p&gt;“Experts aren’t telling you to stock up on essentials because they think you’re going to run out of food &amp;amp; society is going to collapse. It’s because a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;few days of panic buying &amp;amp; high demands cause more panic &amp;amp; stress systems unnecessarily&lt;/a&gt;. Also, being in line with hundreds of people isn’t wise. Go off peak. Buy a little more than what you need. Preparedness isn’t about doing nothing, but also about not overreacting. It’s about doing your part to put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;*slack in our systems*&lt;/a&gt; so that short disruptions are smooth as possible, can absorb extra load, &amp;amp; resources remain available for those most in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t bother buying bottled water; tap water is very unlikely to be impacted and anyway, boiling would be adequate if it turned out it were needed for unforeseen reasons. Intestinal symptoms of coronavirus are very rare; there’s no reason to expect that supplies of toilet paper will dry up. Get what you need. Leave the rest for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can work from home (WFH) 100% of the time; that is ok. Part time WFH is better than none. Don’t wait for your employer to mandate WFH for everyone. Ask your manager if it would be permissible for you personally. Encourage your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can WFH, do it &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; because your barber, your kid’s teacher, your local restaurant staff, your barista, and your doctors etc. can not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great software now makes distance collaboration easier than ever. My personal favorites are below. The choice of collaboration tools isn’t important: use whatever works for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google drive (collaborative documents) is free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom.us (video conferencing) is free up to 40 mins,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack/Gitter (free instant messaging).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype is also free and works pretty well for videoconferencing with 2 people at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a dry run. See what is missing so that you’re ready for when it is not optional. Some resources &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BadassBowden/status/1235793674174435328&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for people with ADHD working from home for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially if you live by yourself. In the event of local transmission call each other daily. If anyone is sick, call them twice daily and have an agreed-upon contactless plan for delivering food, pain relief, and prescribed medications as well as for back up care of dependents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are already struggling with pre-existing demanding medical conditions may have useful experience to share about preparedness and about how to navigate the kinds of operational challenges the rest of us may be just coming to grips with. Ask them what they need from you, then provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good opportunity to think about longer term versions of these care contingency plans (if for some reason the patient were to pass away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a lighter note, go ahead and use the pandemic excuse to beg out of any in-person meeting / party / wedding you would attend only out of some vague sense of duty. If you’re not really certain to enjoy it yourself or to bring joy to someone you really love then just. skip. it. Attend remotely if you can. Or show your face for a few mins and head back out. Send a gift instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are planning a wedding and wondering what to do, a mini-thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/figgyjam/status/1236997165626478593&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m developing guidance on this right now and others are welcome to weigh in, but a few things off the top of my head: If you have the ability to do so, consider a ‘staging’ area for clean entry into your home. Remove shoes, outerwear. If you work in a high risk environment like a hospital, nursing home, etc, wash your clothes immediately and then dry them at high heat or at least dry in the sunshine. Wash hands right away. Isolate your mail, packages and purchases (including food) before bringing them into the house and leave them isolated a few hours at a minimum. If you are in an especially high risk group, you might want to consider leaving goods isolated a longer time (a few days) and avoid eating raw produce, and also decontaminating products that come into your house. I know of no data yet available specific to the viability of this specific strain of the virus, so this guidance is based on comparable viruses in the family. [guidance needed as to how best to do this; what potency of bleach solution/duration etc?].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;LOOK_BEYOND_YOURSELF&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;LOOK BEYOND YOURSELF&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At all times, be kind to each other and be mindful of other people‘s worries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1235318985429782532&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;You may be in a low risk group and feel this is nothing to fret about, but your 80-year old neighbor or your friend with recent heart surgery may feel quite differently.&lt;/a&gt; Every person matters; no one is “expendable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JasonWilliamsNY/status/1236332192172838912&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;With all the cancellations this is one of the first times I’ve seen normalization of an “it’s everybody’s problem approach.” Yes, your one cancelled event might not save lives but the fact that everyone is doing this will. Same mentality is needed for climate change.&lt;/a&gt; Because travel is a big source of the spread, use the occasion to buy locally grown produce. This will reduce coronavirus transmission, support your local economy, and also have a net carbon savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare your home for the possibility you’ll need to isolate and care for an infected member of your household. Stock the room in advance with food that the infected person can consume with zero preparation and without face-to-face interaction with others. If you have a dedicated bathroom for the infected person, that is best. Realistically, given shortages you won’t have access to a mask, but if you do have one, prioritize its use on the infected person rather than caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is any indication, the link tracking for this very guidance document (stats can be viewed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/corona-guidance+&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bit.ly/corona-guidance+&lt;/a&gt;) shows that the word is getting out on twitter, where scientists have a larger usership; however it is lagging on facebook and on direct shares where the general public need it most. Call a friend. Call your family. You will have the most influence on people you personally know. While there are certainly reasons not to panic, most people should be more concerned than they are. Raise the floor of awareness, not the ceiling; this will be much more effective in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One aspect of that policymakers desperately need more information on is how readily children can transmit the virus. We know children experience milder disease than adults but do they transmit to others?” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1236286986161356801&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;There’s been some seemingly contradictory evidence on this front so far.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, do your best to demonstrate, teach, and reinforce good hand hygiene for kids, but be realistic too. In the absence of a clear signal on the degree to which kids are vectors, keep your kids’ fingernails (and yours) as short as is (safely) possible so that virus has fewer crannies in which to hide. I’ve stopped wearing rings for that same reason; I don’t know that there’s been a formal study on this ring idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only if you are in a financial and operational position to do so, consider temporarily tutoring or home schooling, or even just keeping kids home from after-school activities or for part of the school day. Don’t compromise your kids’ education, but every little bit of distancing helps. Do what you can and don’t sweat the rest. You should not feel personally responsible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also why top-down measures (event cancellation and imposed quarantine etc) work. The average person, even ones with baseline good hygiene, touch their faces constantly already without thinking about it. Especially with allergy season coming up, please keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be good to your body. Expect companies to capitalize on your fear. Don’t buy products that claim to protect or heal you at this point. Currently available products like ibuprofen and paracetamol can be useful to lessen some symptoms; however so far, nothing has been proven to do above random noise. Don’t believe individuals who say that crystals, essential oils, etc. have helped them; the folks sharing these products may have the best intentions, or they may be predatory. But the idea is the same: many patients spontaneously do get better on their own because most cases are mild and resolve without pharmaceutical intervention. Instead of worrying about remedies, eat good food. Exercise. Meditate. Rest. Don’t neglect your mental health and don’t use your anxiety as an excuse for poor behavior towards others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is overwhelming historical evidence for cancellation as an effective public health measure. I’ve retweeted some good resources &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1235906489921007616&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can use that thread alone to help convince decisionmakers to cancel events. Here’s the money shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;10.111111111111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;There is a reason for canceling public gatherings. In a pandemic, don’t be Philadelphia (held a parade in 1918 when cases started to come up, downplayed cases), be St. Louis (canceled gatherings). More here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KE7RYbxDGM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://t.co/KE7RYbxDGM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mlipsitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@mlipsitch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wyrHx0nOLA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wyrHx0nOLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Florian Krammer (@florian_krammer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1235761684431724550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;March 6, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait to cancel until things are demonstrably really bad; this leaves available only the most socially disruptive interventions (like closing schools). Measures as extreme as closing schools tend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AWhitTwit/status/1236010269605687296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;burden vulnerable populations the most. (E.g., because the poorest kids only eat at school).&lt;/a&gt; If you’re in a position to help kids in these scenarios, try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII/status/1237004025331167233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;give money directly&lt;/a&gt;; the case for this is well established. When elementary schools close, it also makes it harder for health workers, teachers, city officials, etc. to get to work and keep things on track. Kids may have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AWhitTwit/status/1236010269605687296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nowhere to go when parents are at work&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressive social distancing measures are never too late, but they are most effective at flattening the curve if undertaken before 1-2% of the population is infected [ I read this somewhere but lost the citation, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/figgyjam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DM&lt;/a&gt; if you can help]. It isn’t just large events to avoid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-06/biogen-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19-after-boston-meeting?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_content=business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;even small meetings can have consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put out the call for tooling that would help event planners model go/no-go decisions more appropriately. If you are a scientist interested in collaborating on this, let me know. In meantime, here is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare workers desperately need them to care for you and your loved ones. If healthcare workers are at risk, we are all at risk. Masks are NOT the most useful thing you can do to protect yourself: they’re hard to wear properly, especially for long periods of time, and their effectiveness against viral particles stops as the filter gets moist with your breathing (about 30 minutes). Also for some people, wearing a mask makes it more likely that they will touch their face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where possible, use knuckles rather than finger tips (e.g., for elevator buttons, light switches, etc.). Open doors with your hips rather than your hands. You may use your elbows to open door handles, if it’s an option. Use a sleeve to open a doorknob if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good idea — even if it is not coronavirus. Health systems need every available capacity. Don’t cause unnecessary panic. Don’t assume it is just a common cold. Definitely stay home if you have a fever or cough.&lt;/p&gt;

You would be putting the lives of others at risk. It is not just that people are dying, but how they are dying. To say nothing of the physical trauma, emotionally speaking this is the opposite of a “good death”. People are dying alone, quarantined from those they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early reports are that people who recover develop antibodies that provide immunity if they are infected with the same strain again. However, this is great news for vaccine development, so flatten the curve and wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can get very serious; one person described the pain as feeling like her lungs were being &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236517734189391875&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;put through a pasta maker&lt;/a&gt;. 10% of cases require ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Even if autopsy reports from China have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1235797950451703809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;misrepresented&lt;/a&gt; or overstated, there is a possibility of long term or permanent lung damage if you do get sick and recover. There are lot of gaps in the information about lung damage, mostly because everyone qualified to let the public know exactly what is going on is already very busy saving lives and putting their own at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;DO_NOT_BE_RACIST&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; DO NOT BE RACIST &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t use “concern” as a smoke screen for racism. The virus is here now. It could have started anywhere. Use the same empathy as if the source city were your own. Next time it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;BE_PRESENT_DO_NOT_BINGE_THE_NEWS&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;su-highlight&quot;&gt; BE PRESENT. DO NOT BINGE THE NEWS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done everything you can, step back. Way back. Watch something funny. Read a good book. Learn an instrument. Garden. Hug your kid. Call your mom. Hug your mom. Call your kid. Be present. Take this moment to be grateful that you are alive on this amazing planet. We are in this together; look after each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a masters degree in public health from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lshtm.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; as well as a background in infectious diseases and vaccine development. The impact of this pandemic will be needlessly amplified by misinformation, so be careful. I’ve endeavored to be as accurate as possible without causing panic. I have not been paid to write this post, but given my training I do feel like it is my responsibility. This is a volunteer effort that qualified people are welcome to help contribute to. Frankly the only reason it is not anonymous is because it would be less likely to be taken seriously, and we need all of the gravitas we can get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I worked in the TB and HIV vaccine field from 2000-2010 but have since switched gears into rare disease genetics. I’m currently an assistant professor (senior research) at Oregon State University in the College of Public Health; to learn more about our group’s work in computer models for rare genetic disease feel free to have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tislab.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tislab.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note, I’m not speaking on behalf of any institution&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m just applying what I know and listening to the evidence as it rapidly emerges. It isn’t perfect.

&lt;p&gt;You can install msgpack via maven:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
  ...
  &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.msgpack&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;msgpack&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Simple Serialization/Deserialization/Duck Typing using Value&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;// Create serialize objects.
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; src = new ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;();
src.add(&quot;msgpack&quot;);
src.add(&quot;kumofs&quot;);
src.add(&quot;viver&quot;);

MessagePack msgpack = new MessagePack();
// Serialize
byte[] raw = msgpack.write(src);

// Deserialize directly using a template

System.out.println(dst1.get(0));
System.out.println(dst1.get(1));
System.out.println(dst1.get(2));

// Or, Deserialze to Value then convert type.
Value dynamic = msgpack.read(raw);
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; dst2 = new Converter(dynamic)
    .read(Templates.tList(Templates.TString));
System.out.println(dst2.get(0));

<title>New flaw in Intel chips lets attackers slip their own data into secure enclave</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/new-flaw-in-intel-chips-lets-attackers-slip-their-own-data-into-secure-enclave/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/new-flaw-in-intel-chips-lets-attackers-slip-their-own-data-into-secure-enclave/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;A new flaw in &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/intel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;intel&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; chips threatens to allow attackers to not just view privileged information passing through the system but potentially also insert new data. The flaw isn’t something the average user has to worry about, but it is a sign of the times as far as the shape of threats to our information’s security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device/&quot;&gt;Meltdown, Spectre&lt;/a&gt; and Heartbleed — this one has a decidedly less catchy name: Load Value Injection, or LVI. It was discovered independently by BitDefender and by a multi-university group led by Jo Van Bulck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact technical details (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lviattack.eu/&quot;&gt;as documented here&lt;/a&gt;) of the flaw aren’t anything the average user would understand or be able to fix themselves. But here’s what you should know: LVI is part of a general category of flaws that have to do with a technique used by most modern computing architectures called “speculative execution.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Speculative execution is a bit like, if someone started writing a math problem on a chalkboard rather slowly, you decided to preemptively solve the problem in each of the 10 ways it could possibly be solved. That way, when the teacher finishes writing the problem, you have the answer ready, and simply discard the others. Processors do this too, in a much more complex and regimented way, of course, using spare cycles to &lt;em&gt;speculatively execute&lt;/em&gt; various lines of computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently this process has been shown to be less than secure in that by carefully poking and prodding at the chip’s deepest levels of code, you can get it to cough up data that would normally be highly protected and encrypted. But while Meltdown and Spectre were about forcing that leakage and collecting the data, LVI takes it a step further, letting the attacker place new values into the process so they can interfere with or even control the outcome. What’s more, this takes place inside the “SGX Enclave,” intended to be an impregnable sub-system that can be trusted to be secure. (To be clear, this is nowhere near arbitrary code execution but rather a new, effective method to manipulate this ostensibly secure channel. This paragraph has been slightly updated to make that clearer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These processes are so deep within the computer’s many layers of code and execution that it’s impossible to say what they can and can’t be used for. It’s safest to assume that, with an issue this fundamental — letting an attacker substitute certain secure values with their own — that the entire thing is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1956585&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1956585&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1956585 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;510&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png 1467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LVI-logo.png?resize=50,38 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1956585&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The name isn’t so catchy, but it does have a cool logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mitigations, of course, but they can severely affect the performance of the chip. Nevertheless, they must be put in place on any exposed chip with this flaw — and that’s pretty much any modern Intel chip that came out before last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel itself is very much aware of the issue and in fact published a 30-page technical summary of LVI and the various specific attacks it enables. It is careful to note at the outset, however, that this is not the sort of thing that gets deployed at large:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the numerous, complex requirements that must be satisfied to implement the LVI method successfully, LVI is not a practical exploit in real-world environments,” the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why you don’t need to worry about it. The simple truth is you’re probably not an ideal target for this attack. It’s not easy to pull off, and as an individual your data is better got at either via traditional means (phishing and the like) or by collecting it in bulk at the data center level. So what’s important is not you updating your PC as soon as possible, but the companies that own and run millions of servers doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, however, it may be that systems with no public exposure are more or less incapable of being accessed by attackers, and even if they were, they might not handle any data that’s worth getting hold of. So ultimately it’s up to these companies to decide their priorities, and after that it’s up to chipmakers like Intel to design future chips and architectures without flaws like LVI and the others built in. Of course, that’s rather hard to do given the complexity of those systems, but there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about LVI at the site set up to document it. Or you can just watch the ridiculous “teaser” put together by the research team that identified the flaw:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tips for the depressed</title>
<link>https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/tips-for-the-depressed/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/tips-for-the-depressed/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;The phenomenology&lt;/span&gt; of depression is endlessly varied. Some of these tips may be useful to many readers; some to a few; some to none at all. If any of them helps lighten anyone’s suffering by a grain, it will be worth the effort. There is no authority behind any of these suggestions beyond my own long experience of depression and what I’ve gathered from reading about others’. I don’t think any of them are risky, but if you have any doubts, talk them over with partners, friends, caregivers, or fellow sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Waking Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;For many depressed people&lt;/span&gt;—for me when depressed—waking up is the worst moment of the day. Emerging from unconsciousness, you are completely undefended. Sometimes there’s an instant of blankness and you wonder: is it gone, am I free? Then the horror seeps or surges back. Whatever strength you’ve gathered during sleep just seems to have amplified it. You’ve recharged the battery, but the static is louder than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what you can do about this, except be prepared for it. And see “Sleep” below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting Out of Bed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A hideous ordeal.&lt;/span&gt; Probably the best way is to have an obnoxiously loud alarm clock on the other side of the room. It should have a “snooze” button, in case you crawl back into bed, as you probably will. At some point, perhaps after the third or fourth snooze, try to slip into the bathroom and splash cold water on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll know you’ve decided to stay up when you start shaking all over. Maybe you won’t, but I do. Just one semi-voluntary spasm after another for anything from five minutes to an hour. Take deep breaths, stretch, splash more cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, somewhere or other, I read this advice: “The most important thing a depressed person can do is: Get dressed!” Curiously, it helps. Lying in bed seems like a natural response to agonizing pain, but usually the pain just gets worse. Maybe the few minutes it takes to make the bed, wash up, and put on clothes are enough to break some deadly mental circuit. Try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting from One Room to Another&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Usually cannot be done&lt;/span&gt; with dignity. You will lurch, shuffle, careen. Your head will hang down, your shoulders hunch, you will be a slumping shambles. And when you get to the next room, you will discover that you forgot something you need in the room you just left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Keep Your House from Becoming a Disaster Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;This is straightforward:&lt;/span&gt; you pay someone to do it. Otherwise, forget it. After a while, depression is exhausting beyond words. Vacuuming, dusting, laundry, changing the sheets, washing the dishes, cooking, shopping—together these are as hard as running the Boston Marathon would be for the average out-of-shape non-depressed person. You will forget things, lose things, drop things, spill things, break things, run into things. Don’t be mad at yourself—remember, you’re being invisibly, silently, savagely tortured. You have a perfect right to let things go a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Don’t dehydrate.&lt;/span&gt; Drink plenty of water, on a regular schedule. Don’t wait till you’re thirsty. Your urine should be pale, not vividly colored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, being depressed burns up a lot of energy. Of course there’s no output—you don’t achieve anything—but your metabolism is racing. And you cry. Not enough water and you become slightly feverish and groggy. It’s very unpleasant, and it’s unnecessary. Fill three or four water bottles at the beginning of the day and put them around your house or workplace, where you can’t miss them. In cold weather, make yourself a lot of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Everything is hard&lt;/span&gt; when you’re depressed, even eating. And besides, you’re probably not moving around much, so you don’t build up an appetite easily. I always lose a lot of weight when depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the damage, make a smoothie the first thing every morning. Toss a banana, blueberries, yogurt, almond milk, fruit juice, wheat germ, and protein powder into the blender. (If you can stand it, add a little of some weird-tasting plant-based powder—Perfect Food, Ultimate Meal, lots of others—but don’t force yourself.) Then, whatever else you do or don’t eat all day, you won’t be malnourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s hard to eat, it’s just about impossible to cook, so have a lot of snack food in your fridge. But let it be healthy snack food: hummus, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, almond butter, whole-grain crackers, celery, carrots, fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people eat compulsively when depressed, for comfort. If you have to, don’t fight it. But remember, some healthy things are delicious too. Usually they cost more, but they’re worth it. Junk food—candy, cookies, chips, soda—is a kind of drug, and will eventually make you feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;It is universally recognized,&lt;/span&gt; in fact trumpeted, nowadays that regular exercise is good for your mental health. It is less often acknowledged that for a severely depressed person, vigorous exercise can seem as difficult as running &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; Boston Marathons in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least walk. Ask your spouse/partner/friends/relatives/hired helpers to drag you outside, or even to the gym. Try for a little aerobic exercise—i.e., something that makes you short of breath—each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Is mindfulness&lt;/span&gt; the wisdom of the East finally made appealingly practical for Westerners, or is it just another form of Positive Thinking? I inclined to the latter view until I came across Sam Harris’s &lt;em&gt;Waking Up&lt;/em&gt;. If this aggressively skeptical rationalist has found great value in meditation for wholly secular reasons, then no one else need feel overly fastidious about trying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its worst, the pain of depression obliterates ordinary consciousness, as the pain of terminal cancer is said to do. The pain consumes, annihilates, your awareness of anything else. By teaching you to focus on discrete sensations and tasks, mindfulness practice can help remind you that there is a you beyond the pain. It can help you hold on until the pain recedes—which, unlike the pain of terminal cancer, it will eventually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful place to begin is &lt;em&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Williams and Danny Penman. Also &lt;em&gt;The Mindful Way Through Depression&lt;/em&gt;, by Williams, Jon Kabat-Zinn, et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;It isn’t cheap,&lt;/span&gt; insurance usually won’t pay, and it doesn’t help everyone, to say the least. But it helps some people; and unlike nearly all antidepressants, it seems to have no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Passing the Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A minimal definition&lt;/span&gt; of depression is: the inability to feel pleasure. As its severity increases, it becomes what William James called “a positive and active anguish, a form of psychical neuralgia wholly unknown to normal life.” At the extreme, pleasure and even distraction are impossible. But before that, or after it, popular culture can be a solace. &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt; got me through one depression, and (I blush to admit) reruns of &lt;em&gt;24&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; through another. There’s also &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, Bernard Cornwell’s many epics, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; in print and living color, vast tracts of science fiction (don’t miss Kim Stanley Robinson’s magnificent &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt; trilogy), and, on the border of entertainment and art, Patrick O’Brian’s Aubrey-Maturin novels. There’s something for everyone in American popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Sleep medications&lt;/span&gt; can be helpful, but only temporarily; in the long term, they can be addictive. Getting some exercise during the day should help. Another thing to try is music. For years now, I’ve fallen asleep to Renaissance sacred music—that exquisite vocal polyphony that sounds like a choir of angels. Try also, for an hour or half-hour before sleep, sitting quietly (or pacing, if you must) and listening to some soothing music. I’m a classical music fan, so what works for me is Bach, Haydn, Mozart—mostly chamber music, but some orchestral—or earlier: lute, viol, and consort music from the 16th and 17th centuries. Something or other will work for you—ask friends with similar tastes for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, you will fall asleep without too much difficulty but will awaken during the night or at first light and be unable to fall asleep again. Don’t lie awake too long. Get up and pace or listen to music or try to read. It is a hellish time. William Styron in &lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt; has a pithy sentence about this experience: “The combination of exhaustion with sleeplessness is a rare torture.” If only it were rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strangers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On bad days, you’ll look and act like a zombie. Fortunately, most Americans have heard the word “depression” by now—there are, after all, millions of victims—and know that one is supposed to feel sorry for depressed people rather than wary of them. Don’t be embarrassed if your voice quavers or your eyes fill with tears. Try to smile: it will put other people at ease, and they’ll appreciate your gallantry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;If you’ve earned&lt;/span&gt; someone’s unconditional devotion, for example as a parent, child, spouse, partner, or friend, then you’re lucky indeed. But even if not, it’s likely that some people, perhaps many, love you and will want to help. They can, very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s primal: when you’re hurting badly, you don’t want to feel alone and abandoned. You want to be held: literally, if possible; or figuratively, in a web of affection and concern. Ask friends to email, call, or visit regularly: some every day, some every other day, some once or twice a week, depending on how close the friendship. The contact can be brief, but it should be regular. Banalities are fine: “I love you.” “Hang on.” “How bad is it today?” “It will get better.” “Have you eaten?” “I think of you a lot.” They can tell you what they’re doing and thinking about. Or you can sob. Or you can be silent together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send out bulletins: “Liking that novel you brought me.” “Took a walk.” Or to especially close friends, simple cries: “Can’t get out of bed.” “Pain level at minus 9 today.” “Oh God!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to ask friends for material help: to shop for you, to cook, to drive you to doctor’s appointments, to come over and watch television with you, or to just be there while you clean the house or do your laundry or pay bills, if you find those things too hard to do by yourself. And a note to friends: ask often. Don’t ask only once, or assume that because a depressed person doesn’t ask, they wouldn’t say yes if you offered. They may simply be unable to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Depression may give you&lt;/span&gt; a deeper appreciation of Karl Marx’s observations about money as social power. Rich people may or may not be happier than non-rich people, but the quality of their unhappiness is definitely better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re non-rich, it’s probably best not to make large discretionary purchases when you’re depressed. If you’re strongly tempted, or it’s a great bargain, at least run it by friends or a therapist. On the other hand, do pamper yourself in small ways: almond milk, the best nut butters, artisanal bread, cheese, and beer, gourmet deli sandwiches, that exquisite scarf or vintage leather jacket. Raid your Amazon “Saved for Later” list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not to miss paying bills. If you can’t bring yourself to pay them as they come in, have a little box or basket in which you toss them, and every couple of weeks ask a friend to come over and help you get through them. Or, of course, pay them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;After fifty years,&lt;/span&gt; billions of dollars of intensive marketing campaigns, and tens of billions of dollars of profits for pharmaceutical companies, it is still far from clear that antidepressant drugs are any more effective than placebo. The only group of people who have demonstrably benefited from the widespread use of antidepressants are pharmaceutical executives and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many intelligent and honest physicians and scientists believe that they do help some people a great deal. It’s definitely worth trying medication if you’re badly depressed. Be sure to ask about the possible side effects and investigate them online yourself. In my case, none of the drugs worked spectacularly well. Only a couple had intolerable side effects or made the depression worse. One side effect I wish I’d known about is that the SSRI (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) family of antidepressants, used long-term, may cause anorgasmia. (Look it up—you’ll sympathize.) As I have been living, nevertheless, on the cutting edge of the pharmacological wing of depression therapy, here are some personal notes on efficacy and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;106&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ativan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(lorazepam):&lt;/em&gt; An anti-anxiety drug, one of a class called “benzodiazepines,” from its chemistry.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; It’s very effective at putting you to sleep, but also very habit-forming. Helped me calm down after Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buspirone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A somewhat idiosyncratic antidepressant-plus-anti-anxietal, whose supposed mechanism I don’t remember. Didn’t have much effect on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desipramine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This is a “tricyclic” antidepressant, a term derived from its chemical structure. It made me feel a little sluggish, but I think it worked: I gradually felt better. Very gradually, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effexor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(venlafaxine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;A SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor). Supposedly a double-barreled threat. Hopes were high, and it seemed to work at first. Eventually I fell into a severe depression while on the drug and, for some reason, blamed it on Effexor. Apart from Prozac, the only time a drug actually made me feel worse (though in this case, I’m not so sure it was the drug).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Klonopin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;clonazepam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; Another benzodiazepine, which I took to help me sleep but didn’t find terribly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lithium: &lt;/em&gt;This is more often used for bipolar disease (aka manic-depression). But there’s also a long tradition of using it for depression alone. It made me pretty sluggish and didn’t help greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pamelor (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;nortriptyline)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;another tricyclic, which we went to after Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parnate (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;tranylcypromine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This is an MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitor. I forget exactly why one wants to inhibit monoamine oxidase. These were the first class of antidepressants discovered. They’ve fallen out of favor because they involve serious (for some people) dietary restrictions: you can’t have red wine, sausage, cheese, chocolate, fava beans, and a few other things while taking MAO inhibitors or you may have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prozac&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(fluoxetine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This was the first of the SSRIs, and it more or less put antidepressants on the map. First, because there was an excitingly plausible theory of how they worked: (1) emotional well-being depends on the smooth functioning of a person’s neurons, the cells that relay information around the brain; (2) neuronal transmission is facilitated by chemical substances called &lt;em&gt;neurotransmitters&lt;/em&gt;: serotonin, norepinephrine, and a few others; (3) sometimes neurons absorb neurotransmitters at too high a rate, so there’s not enough left to carry information; (4) if you can prevent (inhibit) this uptake of neurotransmitters, the brain can go back to functioning normally. And second, because there didn’t seem to be any side effects at first. Alas, there is a rare but dangerous one: &lt;em&gt;akathisia&lt;/em&gt;, or intense agitation, which has in some cases (or so it’s claimed) driven people to suicide. I did get akathisia from Prozac, but not a severe case, and it subsided quickly when I discontinued the drug. In &lt;em&gt;Listening to Prozac&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Kramer popularized the phrase “better than well” to describe how Prozac makes you feel. But when it induces akathisia—restlessness, intense agitation—it’s worse than bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ritalin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(methylphenidate)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; This is not an antidepressant but a stimulant, often given for ADHD or (sub rosa) to help students stay up all night writing papers or studying for exams. I wasn’t depressed at the time but lethargic, and the doctor thought it might give me a boost. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trazodone:&lt;/em&gt; a non-benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drug. Not as effective but not as habit-forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valium&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(diazepam)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;Still another benzodiazepine. All the benzodiazepines work, if you take enough of them. But if you do that, you can’t function very well, and you may get addicted. Just as “air fresheners” don’t actually disperse the smell but only cover it over with an even stronger (but less unpleasant) smell, benzodiazepines don’t cure your anxiety, they just make you less able to feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wellbutrin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(bupropion):&lt;/em&gt; Another idiosyncratic antidepressant, whose mechanism is not well understood. It’s often used to supplement other antidepressants, and it’s supposed to have a benign side-effect profile—in rare cases, an epileptic seizure. I took it a couple of times because it’s supposed to counter the sexual side effects of SSRIs. Alas, I seem to be allergic to it; I broke out in a rash both times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoloft&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(sertraline)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; an SSRI, which seemed to work better than anything else to date. I’ve been on and off it for the last two decades. It would wear off periodically, but at first it seemed to have no side effects. Only much later was it recognized that a large proportion of people who take Zoloft and other SSRIs over a long period find their sexual functioning impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ECT/TMS/Ketamine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Like drugs,&lt;/span&gt; electro-convulsive therapy has helped many people over the last several decades. As with drugs, no one knows exactly why. It has been said that we are as far advanced in the understanding of depression at this moment as was the European conquest of the Americas when Columbus first set foot in the Bahamas in 1492. The conquest of depression will undoubtedly be much slower than the conquest of the Americas. Federal funding of depression research is projected to be $406 million in both 2016 and 2017. By contrast, dozens of hedge-fund managers receive more than $1 billion in annual income (on which some of them will pay the same effective tax rate as those earning $55,000, the national median income), and the Pentagon has budgeted $1.5 trillion for the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter-bomber over the next several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, ECT is a fairly blunt instrument, but when first introduced in the early twentieth century, it was a sledgehammer. For very good reasons, patients were frightened of it. It has become much less arduous over the years: there is far less injury, discomfort, and memory loss. It used to be an ordeal; it is now only a pain in the ass. And it usually helps, sometimes dramatically. If you are in unbearable distress, you should consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being a logistical headache (if you’re not an inpatient, you will need a ride two or three days a week, and because you’ll usually be at the hospital for three hours or more, your driver will have to give up most of the day), ECT temporarily lowers your alertness and concentration. If you’re doing it several times a week, you may not be able to keep working. That could be disastrous for you, financially and career-wise. I was blessed with an enlightened employer and—even more important—a strong union, so I twice got to take a three-month paid medical leave. I don’t know what I would have done without them. This is one of many ways in which strong unions are a matter of life and death. There’s plenty of data proving that poverty and economic insecurity increase depression and suicide rates. There’s also plenty of data showing that the decline of (more accurately, the successful assault on) unions has increased poverty and economic insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) is a new and very promising development. A magnetic current is induced within the brain for 20 minutes or so. It’s outpatient, with no anesthetic, no memory loss, no other side effects. The disadvantages: statistically it’s not as effective as ECT; it’s done consecutively every weekday for six weeks; it’s not as commonly covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine, an intriguing drug with psychedelic and anesthetic properties, is the newest thing (along with another new—but also very old—thing, psilocybin) and has produced some dramatic cures. It is expensive and not widely available, but if nothing else works for you, investigate it.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hospitalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;As we all know,&lt;/span&gt; unless you can afford a medical concierge and the most expensive insurance and facilities, the for-profit, private-insurance-based health care system in the United States is somewhere between a headache and a nightmare. Inpatient mental health care is no exception. The quality of life is ultimately defined by your insurance company’s concern to avoid liability: they tend to negotiate very strict controls on hospitals, so that whatever happens, you don’t hurt yourself or others, at least in any way that could result in a claim against them. The result is a nightmare of “safety” restrictions, intrusive monitoring, and utter lack of privacy. That the food is so horrible, the environment so drab and featureless, and the staff so much like cheerful robots, on the other hand, is probably as much the hospital’s fault as the insurance company’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, hospitalization is for those who are helpless or out of control. If you’re jumping out of your skin, or conversely, unable even to speak, or if you’re actively contemplating suicide, by all means seek admittance. Otherwise, you’re probably better off in familiar surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are admitted, try to have friends and family check in frequently—not just with you but also with your doctors, nurses, and attendants. All patients are, in theory, special; but their overworked caregivers sometimes need reminding of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Suicide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Nearly every depressed person&lt;/span&gt; wants to talk about suicide. Apart from mental-health professionals, hardly any non-depressed people do, except perhaps as a philosophical problem (cf. Albert Camus). Depressed people want to open their hearts, to confess their fears and forbidden urges, to be comforted, reassured, persuaded that life is worth living despite this intolerable, indescribable pain. They want the other person to open his or her heart, not recite from a script. The communion of hearts is healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Speaking of scripts: Mental-health professionals frequently ask severely depressed people over and over: “Are you safe/in any danger of harming yourself?” Eventually this starts sounding to many of us like “Am I (or my institution) safe from legal action if you should harm yourself?” Sometimes it seems as though “Do no harm” has morphed into “Incur no liability.” They might, as Robert Lowell once hinted, get more useful answers if they asked: “Suppose you had a little button on the back of your hand, and you could simply press it for a quick, clean, painless death. Would you? Would you ever have?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one should tell depressed people, I think—tell them emphatically, authoritatively, over and over, as often as the demon of depression urges despair, which is all the time—is that if they hang on, they will eventually feel better. This is close to a scientific certainty; depressions virtually always end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may not be enough. As David Foster Wallace explained in a well-known and terrifyingly graphic passage, a suicidal person is a little like someone who jumps from a burning building. Sometimes the pain cannot be endured another moment; it must &lt;em&gt;stop now&lt;/em&gt;. If that happens to someone dear to you, then for their sake, apart from all the other good reasons, think deeply about how to lessen the amount of unnecessary suffering in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a world that is unable or unwilling to prevent or heal intolerable pain ought at least to make it a little less harrowing and humiliating for the sufferer to exit, or even to discuss that freely, is a question I’ll leave, for now, to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In a Burning Building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;If waves of agony&lt;/span&gt; and despair are rolling through you and over you; if gusts of sobbing shake you for hours; if you’re choking, burning up, speechless; if nothing matters except that the pain &lt;em&gt;stop now&lt;/em&gt; . . . then call someone, anyone, 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And shame on the rest of us for letting another human being come to that. Above all, shame on the 1 percent, who by the best scholarly estimates are hiding around nine trillion dollars in offshore tax havens. That money could relieve an awful lot of unnecessary suffering. As certain hardhearted people constantly remind us, it follows from the Second Law of Thermodynamics that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. That may be true in the very long run, but now and probably for a long time to come, it’s a much harsher, hungrier world than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Recovery from&lt;/span&gt; a severe depression is gradual. You won’t regain your full powers immediately. You’ll make a lot of frustrating mistakes, and a lot of ordinary tasks will still seem beyond your strength. Be patient with yourself. Ration your effort, and make plenty of provision for small pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poet Sara Teasdale wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For one white, singing hour of peace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Count many a year of strife well lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I’m not sure I like those proportions for depression. “Many a year” sounds a little glib to anyone who’s known the worst. Still, it’s true that even a little happiness is worth a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stupidest, most exasperating piece of advice commonly offered to suffering people is also the truest and most comforting: time heals. Not always, to be strictly truthful, but almost always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more consolation: you might think that so horrible an experience would leave you with a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder, prone to nightmares, haunted, even obsessed, by memories of torment and fears of a recurrence. It doesn’t. It takes a toll, of course. But eventually you become yourself again, released into blessed everyday unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Svelte is our choice for a large web project</title>
<link>https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its compiler architecture enables amazing tradeoffs for UX and DX. Svelte might be worth your attention, especially if you pine for the web of yore and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s March 2020 and a friend and I are spinning up a big long-term web project. We’re choosing technologies and I’m recommending a UI framework. I love writing frontends and my friend is a backend developer with a little frontend experience. Here’s what our project looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;competes with community platforms like forums and chat apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heavy on content and extra heavy on interactivity and app-like behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embraces the web platform and optimizes for both desktop and mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s big and &lt;a href=&quot;https://felt.dev/about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;we plan to work on it&lt;/a&gt; for many years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So — which frontend JavaScript UI framework should we choose? For context, I’ve used React full-time since 2014 and Svelte for a year. I’ve also made small things with Vue, Angular, and Ember, and before that, I worked with Backbone and jQuery for three years. I pledge no allegiance — all are good tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our top priority is the end user experience. Whatever tools we use should optimize for the quality of the experience while balancing other concerns. This is no simple formula. Many factors affect UX — performance, development speed, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#optimize-for-programmer-happiness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;developer happiness&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these is complex and interrelated. This is a subjective choice, not a solvable equation, and any recommendation is going to be context-dependent and biased. My goal is to communicate why I believe Svelte is the better choice for our project, lay out the pros and cons, especially as they relate to its compiler paradigm, and open doors for you to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the current opening pitch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;svelte.dev&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to Svelte, now would be a good time to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;its introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt;. From here I’ll assume some familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using Svelte for a year and participating in the community, I can say I love its design and I’m having a lot of fun. Svelte provides an enjoyable DX that doesn’t compromise on UX. I think it’ll soon become common knowledge among UI developers that compilers have an advantage over runtime-only frameworks for hitting this sweet spot. Both Angular (&lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io/guide/ivy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ivy&lt;/a&gt;) and Ember (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Octane&lt;/a&gt;) have evolved towards compilation as Svelte helps popularize the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rich-harris&quot;&gt;Rich Harris&lt;/a&gt; created Svelte in 2016 for his work on interactives at the New York Times. The work demanded web UIs that are fast, tiny in bundle size, and quick to produce, with good support for SVG and animations. His colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mbostock&quot;&gt;Mike Bostock&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/d3/d3&quot;&gt;d3&lt;/a&gt;) had been promoting compilation as a powerful pattern that was underutilized on the web. Svelte grew out of these needs and inspiration. In early 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;version 3 was released&lt;/a&gt;, bringing major innovations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/examples#reactive-assignments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reactive assignments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/examples#reactive-declarations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reactive declarations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/examples#ondestroy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;composable lifecycle functions&lt;/a&gt;, attracting significant attention in the web community. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sveltejs/status/1120666410332688386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1120633203927203840&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg/status/1120926295565553665&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1120846189274918912&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;) I was loosely following Svelte because it kept smoking benchmarks, and version 3’s ergonomics and reactivity convinced me of its potential — I began using it for risk-tolerant projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/svelte/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;State of JS 2019 survey&lt;/a&gt;, 75% of respondents have heard of Svelte, 45% are interested in learning it, and 7% have used it. (all public survey data is going to have biases, but roughly speaking, these are great numbers for a smalltime framework) It’s no exaggeration when author Rich Harris calls the community &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rich_harris/status/1207505891693600769&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;small but mighty&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to modern mainstream frameworks like React and Vue and their communities, Svelte is smaller and less mature, but its community is active and established. Svelte is now commonly mentioned in the same breath as React, Vue, Angular, Preact, and Ember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all technologies Svelte has its tradeoffs. We’ll explore both the pros and cons ahead. The costs and benefits to your projects are situational. Some downsides are unavoidable, but many are temporary if growth and development continue. First let’s talk about the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to create amazing user interfaces that exceed expectations, and Svelte is a tool that delivers. By default, Svelte websites are fast and lightweight. As a tool, it’s powerful, flexible, and beautifully designed. Making things with Svelte feels fun and streamlined. Let’s walk through the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;easy to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte is easy to learn. Its design philosophy shares much with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt;. The team values beginner friendliness and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;official tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is excellent and approachable. The official blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-for-new-developers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;“Svelte for new developers”&lt;/a&gt; helps those new to Node and the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;code&gt;.svelte&lt;/code&gt; files pack together all three of the web’s languages with holistically-designed extensions. Like Vue, Svelte templates are a superset of HTML. If you know HTML and CSS, you can write Svelte immediately and learn more as you go, layering useful concepts on top of the web platform. People who already know JavaScript and a modern frontend framework regularly mention how easy it is to learn Svelte. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sveltejs/status/1167081592420012032&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hexrcs/status/1185186492982943744&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1221799311144603651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most frameworks that abstract the DOM, Svelte has incompatibilities like the inability to name a prop &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; because it’s a reserved keyword in JS, and you’ll use &lt;code&gt;on:click&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt;, but these quirks are few in number and reflect carefully chosen tradeoffs. Svelte does its best to harmonize with the web platform, welcoming both experienced developers and newcomers with whatever web knowledge they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;syntax and semantics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Svelte language’s extensions to HTML, CSS, and JS are designed to improve the development experience, and they set the framework clearly apart from its peers. Svelte initially received a lot of attention for its performance and small bundles, but since v3 the dev team has emphasized Svelte’s DX advantages. Here are some of the official examples, which hopefully speak for themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;write less code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte code is terse, and not in a cryptic way — component definitions feel distilled to their essence, with hardly any wasted characters. See the official blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;“Write less code”&lt;/a&gt; for the full picture. Rich Harris also gave a related talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzX4aTRPzno&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;“The Return of ‘Write Less, Do More’”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;compilers enable output flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a compiler, Svelte can tailor its output code for context-specific needs. For example, it can write to targets like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/docs#Custom_element_API&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;custom elements&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a. web components — and component libraries can export both Svelte components and vanilla JS scripts. This makes it a good candidate for incremental adoption, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pngwn/svelte-adapter&quot;&gt;using Svelte components with React and Vue&lt;/a&gt;. Svelte outputs small bundles that include only the framework code used by your components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/gl&quot;&gt;experiment with WebGL&lt;/a&gt; and the NativeScript integration &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native&quot;&gt;svelte-native&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate compile targets beyond the DOM. Its server-side rendering mode compiles components to simple string concatenation for big performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, compilers have access to flexibility and power that runtime-only frameworks lack — this point is deep and there’s a wide frontier to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;feels good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making UIs with Svelte is a pleasure. Svelte’s taste and aesthetics feels like a warm cozy blanket on the stormy web. This impacts everything — features, documentation, syntax, semantics, performance, framework internals, npm install size, the welcoming and helpful community attitude, and its collegial open development and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs&quot;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt; — it all oozes goodness. Its API is tight, powerful, and good looking — I’d point to &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/docs#use_action&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stores&lt;/a&gt; to support this praise, but really, the whole is what feels so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aesthetics of underlying technologies have a way of leaking into the end user experience, and Svelte is a lovely companion. Our team is building open source community tools and Svelte fits our identity as an independent labor of love with an organic community. With some frameworks, you may find your needs at odds with the enterprise-level goals of a megacorp owner, and you may both benefit and sometimes suffer from their web-scale engineering. Svelte’s future does not depend on the continued delivery of business value to one company and its direction is shaped in public by volunteers. Regardless of measurable impact, Svelte resonates with our emotions and it makes for a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;great performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte has excellent performance characteristics. It deserves its reputation for speed but that’s not its top priority — instead Svelte wants to provide an awesome development experience and output code that performs well by default. Svelte can optimize user code at compile-time, like resolving the dependency graph of computed properties to propagate changes with minimal runtime overhead, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1201565469406384128&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there’s low-hanging performance fruit&lt;/a&gt; to be picked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runtime frameworks like React and Vue pay some costs that compilers can minimize or avoid. Virtual DOM implementations have downsides — see the official Svelte blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;“Virtual DOM is pure overhead”&lt;/a&gt;. While Vue is implementing strategies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1184824857663594499&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;optimize its runtime templating&lt;/a&gt;, React is betting long-term on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;concurrent mode&lt;/a&gt; and functional purity to improve performance, leveraging its virtual DOM architecture to unlock benefits unavailable to other frameworks. Concurrent mode applies &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-adoption.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;additional restrictions&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1236460463199850496&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;developers are learning to work with&lt;/a&gt;, which the React team confidently trades for the benefits. The tradeoffs are complex, context-dependent, and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React may provide amazing UX in some circumstances once concurrent mode is ready, but I’m skeptical that their solution is the best one for our problems. My instincts lead me to prefer less abstraction, lean on automated tools like compilers, and avoid runtime costs without clear benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1200807516529147904&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See this comparison&lt;/a&gt; Rich Harris made between Svelte and a popular React concurrent mode demo. Svelte can write code that performs similarly to hand-written JS and sometimes do everything in a single animation frame, where React sometimes spreads equivalent work over multiple frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes is the key word here. There is no objectively right answer for every situation. With Svelte we may end up jealous of React’s sweet non-blocking rendering one day &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1228720823814344705&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;as this tweet portends&lt;/a&gt;, but today Svelte is fast for typical usage and it should continue improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;aligns with the web platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte components are a thin layer over the DOM and naturally expose the web platform. Coding in Svelte feels like I’m moving with the grain of the web. React abstracts the DOM with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1236643811998171136&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;functionally pure declarative rendering&lt;/a&gt; and provides escape hatches back to mutable imperative DOM land. This is a profound philosophical difference that Rich Harris gave a talk about. (unfortunately not recorded — &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PUvpXMBEDS45rd0wHu6tF3j_8wmGC6cOLtOw2hzU-mw/edit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;slides here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is salient with animation — Svelte ships with builtin support for high performance transitions and animations, using optimal CSS when possible and JS when not. In comparison, React’s functional declarative model has developers declare what the UI looks like at individual snapshots in time. Both the code we write and performance are impacted — it can be difficult or verbose to accomplish some things like animations in React, especially without libraries, and high-performance React animation libraries often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framer.com/api/motion/component#performance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bail out of its rendering cycle&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate the DOM directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent mode is a further departure from the DOM and points toward the endgame of React’s functional purity. It’ll be interesting to follow how this philosophical difference plays out as each side of the spectrum moves closer to the theoretical endpoints. Future web standards may or may not follow React’s lead. For our project, we’re comfortable aligning with the web platform for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte’s upsides are compelling to our team, but we also need to understand its downsides. First we’ll discuss the negatives that are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;compilers move complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compiler architecture moves complexity from the runtime and source code to buildtime and tools. Behind Svelte’s simple APIs sits a beefy compiler. Frontend web development has become very tool heavy in the webapp era, so in practice this adds little cost beyond what developers like myself already pay, but increased build complexity is important to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example Vue’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/youyuxi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evan You&lt;/a&gt; has stated that Vue should always be droppable into any webpage for immediate development. Many people like and rely on this ability. It keeps things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte can do this but only by including its compiler in the browser, which currently weighs 870k. This is super useful in some circumstances, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Svelte’s REPL&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a viable option for normal application code. Svelte requires a build step that’s heavier than React’s JSX and Vue’s &lt;code&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;using Svelte means adopting a new language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/0f910048478c2a6505d1c32185b61934&quot;&gt;Svelte is its own language&lt;/a&gt; not plain HTML+CSS+JS, increasing the risks of adoption, but it adheres closely to the web platform outside of its own targeted enhancements. Svelte changes some of JavaScript’s semantics to support useful features by extending/reusing/reinterpreting valid syntax. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-assignments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reactivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/auto-subscriptions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;auto-subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;declaring props&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As as result, you'll need more specialized tools, a little more framework-specific knowledge, and you'll be slightly more locked into using Svelte, because the language extensions increase the difficulty of converting Svelte components to another framework. (in some hypothetical disaster scenario)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Harris is proposing to standardize its templating language as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/htmlx-org/HTMLx&quot;&gt;HTMLx&lt;/a&gt;, which may or may not gain adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte CSS is scoped to components, which is a nice default, and it provides the &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/docs#style&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;:global&lt;/code&gt; escape hatch&lt;/a&gt; to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1120737306774843392&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Svelte isn’t alone in its approach&lt;/a&gt; of extending languages, but it goes further than Angular and Vue, which extend HTML but not JS, though their JS is subject to framework-specific rules and behaviors not unlike Svelte. React introduced both JSX and hooks, the latter of which change some semantic expectations of JS function calls, and it’s arguable whether React or Svelte is the more radical departure from the norm. (sounds like a boring argument tbh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using Svelte for a year, I can comfortably claim it extends the web’s languages with taste and restraint, and for our team it’s worth the costs and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;reactive syntax is for components only&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte’s reactive language extensions are limited to components. In Vue and libraries like the React-friendly MobX, you use the same syntax for reactive primitives in every module, because they are plain JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is a restriction in Svelte, it comes with benefits as well — its reactive syntax is part of why people like it so much, and its simple store contract interoperates with things like RxJS, so you can choose among many libraries or stick with Svelte’s simple builtin stores, depending on the needs of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;rendering blocks the main thread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte may never be able to implement the equivalent of React’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;concurrent mode&lt;/a&gt;, which combines the virtual DOM and interruptible renders to achieve rendering that drops no frames. This could be a big deal and it’s probably the weakest part of my recommendation to my team. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte#great-performance&quot;&gt;the discussion above&lt;/a&gt; for more about concurrent mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Harris &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1148263929497477120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;intends to implement an equivalent to React’s suspense&lt;/a&gt;, so it appears React’s advantage there is temporary. Svelte has a history of surprising innovations but we shouldn’t count on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;if it ain’t broke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React and other mainstream frameworks work great. Is Svelte worth the time and risk? We think so for our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawbacks today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Svelte’s negative tradeoffs reflect its relative youth and not-yet-mainstream popularity. Today these are issues, but I expect them to be resolved as Svelte’s development and adoption continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;immature tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peripheral tooling is a work in progress. With React and TypeScript we can write fairly well-typed frontends with good buildtime error detection, featureful editor plugins, and mature devtool browser extensions. Svelte is its own language, not plain JS, so it needs specialized tooling. Svelte has decent editor support today but the plugins I’ve used have rough edges and missing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte’s TypeScript support is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4518&quot;&gt;a work in progress being helped by a TypeScript team member&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/community&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; has been actively improving tools for the year I’ve been using Svelte (shoutout to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UnwrittenFun&quot;&gt;@UnwrittenFun&lt;/a&gt;) but there’s much to do before the DX feels polished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;best practices are still evolving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte’s userland resources and cultural knowledge like patterns, anti-patterns, best practices, and consensus libraries are sparse and under-developed. People who adopt it today will have to think through problems where other communities have common knowledge solutions, making the learning curve temporarily steeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte’s beginner documentation is great but people are still figuring out what mastery looks like. Thoughtful feedback from experienced Svelte users is readily offered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/chat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, and the community is active on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sveltejs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/svelte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, but not to the degree of React and Vue, which have vast communities and educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our development will be slowed as our team develops ideas about the best ways to build a big Svelte app. I have a lot of experience working on JS frontends and I enjoy the pattern frontier, so I’m personally excited about working in a fresh and chaotic ecosystem with my teammates. For us the slowdown is an acceptable cost and we see a meaningful opportunity to grow as developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;young library ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libraries are fewer in number and generally less mature. Depending on your project and team, this could be irrelevant, inconvenient, or a blocker. Even though Svelte has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/community&quot;&gt;many quality choices&lt;/a&gt; for the basics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte-community.netlify.com/code/?tag=ui+component+sets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;component sets&lt;/a&gt;, its library ecosystem is a fraction of the size of the major frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our project this is not impactful — we’ll be writing most components from scratch for UX and DX reasons. We’re developing our own design language and we care a lot about customizability, consistency, and performance, and off-the-shelf components add significant friction here, especially in a less mature ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For short-term results, Svelte today may not have the libraries to meet one’s needs. We’re investing for the long-term. Implementing components oneself is one of the best ways to gain valuable experience as a developer, and we’re able and willing to spend the time to own our UI and level up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;the bundle size inflection point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte is known for its tantalizingly small JavaScript bundles, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/3945#issuecomment-557840183&quot;&gt;compiler improvements sometimes shrink the output&lt;/a&gt; even more for free, but there’s a problem here. With its current compiler, as more components are added to a single bundle, Svelte’s JS size advantage shrinks and eventually reverses, because Svelte templates are compiled to a form that is more verbose than the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Harris addresses this in the issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2546&quot;&gt;“Yes, but does it scale?”&lt;/a&gt;, saying that code splitting should usually make Svelte websites much smaller, and notes that in the future, Svelte could optionally send a template bytecode instead of compiled JS to clients, substantially lowering bundle sizes after paying the cost of the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However today there is no such Svelte template interpreter. A large majority of websites will not have this problem, but our project is going to have a heavy UI metasystem similar to an IDE, with components that are more difficult to code split and lazy load. Our base JS cost may be larger than the equivalent in other frameworks if we don’t pull off some wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;barrier to open source contributions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project is an open source community platform that seeks to build a community around its source code, and Svelte is going to be a barrier to some would-be contributors — not because it’s difficult to learn (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feltcoop/why-svelte#easy-to-learn&quot;&gt;as mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I think quite the opposite) — but because many people develop an understanding of a single framework, structure their thinking around its patterns, and remain in its garden, often for employment reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who would jump into a React or Vue project won’t look twice at a Svelte codebase — this can be mitigated but not ignored. On the bright side, Svelte may attract some people who have the time and motivation to learn a new framework, and it’s approachable for web developers of any experience level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;fewer jobs today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few jobs for Svelte right now. Our team members are developing skills that might not directly translate to future employment. In my experience, learning multiple frameworks was tremendously helpful for rounding out my frontend skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;it’s a volunteer effort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no full-time team supporting Svelte — its developers are part-time volunteers. Bugs get fixed, features get added, and many professionals rely on it in production, but unlike other major frameworks, nobody is being paid to work on it full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich likes his dayjob, but it seems likely that funding will be available to the dev team in the future, if they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is using bleeding edge tech risky and foolish? How much blood are we talking about? My experience tells me Svelte is a safe choice, more leading edge than bleeding. However I’m more risk tolerant than most people, I have a lot of experience with JS frameworks, and our team is motivated, so we can deal with rough edges. We’re happy to pay the costs of early adoption when a technology provides significant advantages, and that’s our bet for Svelte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of growth, buyin, mindshare, etc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the caveat that hero worship can be gross, distorting, and unhelpful to everyone involved, Svelte author &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rich-harris&quot;&gt;Rich Harris&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@rich_harris on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is one of my favorite open source developers. In the JS community he’s well-known among tool authors for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/803713274596511747&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spreading interesting ideas&lt;/a&gt;. He’s the creator of many open source projects including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rollup/rollup&quot;&gt;Rollup&lt;/a&gt;, the bundler of choice for many libraries including React and Vue. Here are some of his inspiring talks about Svelte:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright! Was that a fairly thorough and clarifying overview? I hope you’ll consider Svelte next time you want to play around with some new technologies and see it as a worthwhile option for making awesome software for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more? &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The interactive Svelte tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start. &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/examples&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The examples&lt;/a&gt; are a good followup, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/docs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the API docs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/chat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discord community&lt;/a&gt; can help you from there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/template&quot;&gt;The basic template&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to begin making stuff, or jump in with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.dev/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt;, the officially supported app framework equivalent of React’s Next.js and Vue’s Nuxt.js. And finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/community&quot;&gt;the Svelte community repo&lt;/a&gt; is a nice door into the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss this post on the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth mentioning that Svelte limits its scope to being only a UI component framework. Like React, it provides just the view layer. Others like Angular and Vue provide a more all-in-one solution with official routers, state management, and more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.dev/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt; is Svelte’s official app framework that adds routing, server-side rendering, and some other essential app features, but it has no opinions about state management and beyond. Some devs prefer Svelte’s minimal approach that defers problems to userland, encouraging more innovation, choice, and fragmentation, and other devs prefer a more fully integrated toolkit with a well-supported happy path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project that prompted this post is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feltcoop/felt&quot;&gt;Felt&lt;/a&gt;, a super customizable community platform. We’re in the planning phase right now — &lt;a href=&quot;https://felt.dev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;felt.dev&lt;/a&gt; has an early mockup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://felt.social&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;felt.social&lt;/a&gt; has a mailing list signup, and we’re @feltcoop on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feltcoop&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feltcoop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Felt is open source, easily self-hosted, and owned by a worker co-op with the future goal of becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.coop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;platform co-op&lt;/a&gt;. The name was inspired by Svelte so our bias goes deep. :]&lt;/p&gt;
