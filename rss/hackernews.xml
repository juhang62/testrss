<title>Apple, Google ban location tracking in apps using their contact-tracing system</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Apple Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AAPL.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O&quot;&gt;AAPL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and Alphabet Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_GOOGL.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Google on Monday said they would ban the use of location tracking in apps that use a new contact tracing system the two are building to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies said privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the developers of official coronavirus-related apps in several U.S. states told Reuters last month it was vital they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple-Google decision to not allow GPS data collection with their contact tracing system will require public health authorities that want to access GPS location to rely on what Apple and Google have described as unstable, battery-draining workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatives likely would miss some encounters because iPhones and Android devices turn off Bluetooth connections after some time for battery-saving and other reasons unless users remember to re-activate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some apps said they planned to stick to their own approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software company Twenty, which developed the state of Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app with both GPS and Bluetooth, said on Monday the app “operates effectively” without the new Apple-Google tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we’ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,” Twenty said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Alberta province, which does not collect GPS data, said it has no plans to adopt the Apple-Google system for its ABTraceTogether app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Google also said Monday they will allow only one app per country to use the contact system, to avoid fragmentation and encourage wider adoption. The companies said they would, however, support countries that opt for a state or regional approach, and that U.S. states will be allowed to use the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times has won its lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission, as a federal judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.501225/gov.uscourts.nysd.501225.33.0.pdf&quot;&gt;ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that the FCC must turn over net neutrality comment records that it refused to give to the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/did-russia-meddle-with-net-neutrality-comments-nyt-sues-fcc-to-find-out/&quot;&gt;sued the FCC in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;, saying the agency denied a Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) request for records that the NYT said might shed light on possible Russian interference in the net neutrality repeal proceeding. The Times' motion for summary judgment was granted by Judge Lorna Schofield of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are pleased that the court saw through the FCC's privacy arguments and understood the public interest in The Times having access to this data,&quot; a NYT spokesperson told Ars today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked the FCC if it will appeal the ruling or supply the records to the NYT as ordered by the judge. We'll update this story if we get a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public-comment process leading up to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/&quot;&gt;December 2017 repeal&lt;/a&gt; of net neutrality rules attracted more than 22 million comments, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/up-to-9-5-million-net-neutrality-comments-were-made-with-stolen-identities/&quot;&gt;millions were made using stolen identities&lt;/a&gt;. The NYT filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/12/fcc-still-hiding-possible-evidence-of-russia-meddling-in-net-neutrality-comments/&quot;&gt;FoIA request&lt;/a&gt; for server logs related to public comments in June 2017, but the newspaper narrowed its request multiple times in response to the FCC's refusal to provide the records. The pared-down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.501225/gov.uscourts.nysd.501225.27.0.pdf&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; the judge approved is for timestamps, originating IP addresses, and user-agent headers related to public comments, which are contained in an API proxy server log at the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FCC arguments rejected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Schofield was not convinced by the FCC's arguments that producing IP addresses and user-agent headers would be too cumbersome for the FCC and that doing so would violate commenters' privacy. Her ruling noted that &quot;every commenter was provided with a privacy notice, stating that '[a]ll information submitted, including names and addresses, will be publicly available via the Web.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument for a substantial privacy risk &quot;is that digital advertisers and digital platforms could combine this data with other available information to create a detailed and intimate profile&quot; of each commenter, Schofield wrote. But the FCC didn't make a persuasive argument on that point, as &quot;the general statements in the agency's declaration that IP addresses and other digital identifiers 'often can be reliably linked to individual persons' to create 'detailed profiles' fall short,&quot; she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the FCC argument that producing the requested records is too difficult, Schofield wrote that &quot;the FCC contends that the API proxy server log is not actually a database, but instead 'a long and unwieldy list of various data' that it should not have to search.&quot; However, the FCC &quot;d[id] not address why such a list does not fall under 'information... in any format' that is subject to FOIA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the FCC objects to producing the relevant materials from the API proxy server log because to do so requires creating a script, which demands &quot;research&quot; rather than simply a &quot;search.&quot; This argument also fails as a matter of law. In contrast to completing a &quot;search,&quot; which FoIA defines as reviewing agency records by automated means to locate responsive records, conducting research and answering questions require &quot;dig[ging] out all the information that might exist, in whatever form or place it might be found.&quot; The FCC contends that the purpose of the script is to conduct a &quot;matching and sorting process&quot; that pulls only the relevant material from the API proxy server log. This &quot;matching and sorting&quot; process is closer to an automated search for responsive records than a scavenger hunt for disparate information. FOIA &quot;clearly require[s] agencies to sort a pre-existing database of information to make information intelligible so that it may be transmitted to the public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC also &quot;made no showing that creating and running such a script would require more than 'reasonable efforts to search' or 'would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system,'&quot; the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user-agent headers sought by the NYT &quot;contain information about a commenter's device, such as the operating system, operating system version, browser version, browser platform and language settings,&quot; which &quot;can help distinguish between different users who share the same IP address,&quot; the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NYT request in public interest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai's repeal was opposed by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/isp-funded-study-finds-huge-support-for-keeping-current-net-neutrality-rules/&quot;&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of comments that weren't either fraudulent or part of form-letter campaigns. Fraudulent comments and form-letter campaigns apparently helped make public opinion seem more divided, though Pai pointed out that the fraud went in both directions. In the FCC's denial of the NYT public-records request, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-18-156A1.pdf&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that a half-million comments submitted from Russian email addresses mostly supported keeping net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schofield said it's in the public interest for the FCC to provide the data requested by the Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here, disclosing the originating IP addresses and user-agent headers would help clarify whether and to what extent fraudulent activity interfered with the comment process for the FCC's [net neutrality repeal], and more generally, the extent to which administrative rulemaking may be vulnerable to corruption. This serves a vital public interest because of the importance of public comments in agency rulemaking,&quot; Schofield wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schofield noted that &quot;the integrity of the notice-and-comment process is directly tied to the legitimacy of an agency's rulemaking,&quot; and that the &quot;comment process is sufficiently important that a rule may be vacated if the agency does not comply with the notice-and-comment requirements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC &quot;argues that adequate information is already available to the public,&quot; noting &quot;that its final rule runs over 500 pages and describes the public comments and other sources considered,&quot; Schofield wrote. But this FCC argument &quot;misunderstands the public interest at stake. The concern is not whether the FCC was appropriately responsive to certain comments. Rather, the concern is whether the notice-and-comment process functioned as a check on agency rulemaking authority as prescribed by federal administrative law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schofield ruled against the NYT's motion for the FCC to pay for its court costs because &quot;the parties have not briefed this issue,&quot; but denied the motion without prejudice so the NYT can resubmit the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the FCC's net neutrality proceeding led to an investigation by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-265&quot;&gt;GAO said&lt;/a&gt; recently that the FCC has implemented most of its recommendations for improving the security of its public comment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT case wasn't the only lawsuit over an FCC refusal to comply with a public records request related to the net neutrality proceeding. In another instance, a judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/judge-fcc-cant-hide-records-that-may-explain-net-neutrality-comment-fraud/&quot;&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; the FCC to hand over records to a journalist; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/fcc-has-to-pay-journalist-43000-after-hiding-net-neutrality-records/&quot;&gt;FCC later paid&lt;/a&gt; the journalist $43,000 in a settlement to cover his attorneys' fees and court costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC1&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;I was drawn to programming, science, technology and science fiction&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC2&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;ever since I was a little kid. I can't say it's because I wanted to&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC3&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;make the world a better place. Not really. I was simply drawn to it&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC8&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;Then I started a software company and poured every ounce of energy&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC10&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;mistakes and learned from them. This experience made me much, much&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC13&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;What's not ok is *how* things ended. Many of the investors turned out&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC19&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;I lost many friends. Throughout the whole thing I was lucky to meet&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC20&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;many brilliant, creative, talented people. Together, we worked *so*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-L21&quot; class=&quot;blob-num js-line-number&quot; data-line-number=&quot;21&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC21&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;hard. Now we don't talk.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-L22&quot; class=&quot;blob-num js-line-number&quot; data-line-number=&quot;22&quot;/&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC23&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;I spent a lot of time thinking about how I contributed to these failed&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC24&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;relationships. I learned a lot from that too. It wasn't my finest&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC26&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;mostly nobody's fault. This is just the reality of what happens to&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC29&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;Then I worked for a tech giant, and then for a high-growth unicorn. It&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-L30&quot; class=&quot;blob-num js-line-number&quot; data-line-number=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC32&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;meaningless business speak, and checked out employees who pretend&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td id=&quot;file-history-txt-LC34&quot; class=&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line&quot;&gt;engineers seem hopelessly naive to me now.&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Show HN: Caddy 2</title>
<link>https://caddyserver.com/v2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://caddyserver.com/v2</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advanced TLS automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caddy was the first server to fully automate public certificate management—so we've been doing this longer than anyone. With more than 5 million certificates under management, Caddy has set the gold standard for other servers to live up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Async management.&lt;/strong&gt; Certificate automation never blocks the main thread of the web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle retries.&lt;/strong&gt; Failed validation attempts are retried with exponential backoff for up to 1 month. They don't count against normal rate limits; Caddy uses staging/test endpoints during retries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCSP stapling and caching.&lt;/strong&gt; Caddy staples OCSP to all qualifying certificates and keeps them conservatively fresh. It even caches them to disk in case of extended OCSP responder outages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-replace after revocation.&lt;/strong&gt; If the latest OCSP staple indicates a revocation, Caddy automatically replaces the revoked certificate with a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage pre-checks.&lt;/strong&gt; Before attempting costly or valuable ACME transactions, Caddy checks to ensure its storage space is sufficient and writeable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal throttling and job scheduling.&lt;/strong&gt; Give Caddy a million certs to manage: no problem, it will gracefully manage them as fast as it can without hammering the CA or duplicating jobs over a long period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLS session ticket key rotation.&lt;/strong&gt; Caddy automatically rotates TLS 1.2 session ticket keys for better privacy. It can even do this across a cluster!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleet coordination.&lt;/strong&gt; All Caddy instances configured for the same storage backend will automatically share certificate and coordinate management in its cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32.63119266055&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real-life examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, several popular sites went down for many users of mainstream clients because crucial OCSP infrastructure had an extended outage. Only Caddy staples and caches OCSP responses by default, so all Caddy sites were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently in 2020, a mass certificate revocation event left many sysadmins scrambling to renew their certificates ahead of schedule. Caddy automatically renews certificates that get revoked, and all Caddy sites were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have deployed Caddy in front of their site just hours before important audits—potentially saving their compliance status—because of Caddy's safe defaults and &quot;batteries included&quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended by experts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;TLS must be enabled by default ... and the Caddy web server is a good and usable example.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;   —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/krombholz&quot;&gt;Krombholz et al., USENIX 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Caddy is impressive. This is what we want, setting up a secure website.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;   —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE5UhQGg_Fo&quot;&gt;Josh Aas, Executive Director, Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;No popular server software does [session ticket key rotation], with the exception of Caddy.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;   —&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2987443.2987480&quot;&gt;Springall et al., ACM IMC 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bzdropcap&quot;&gt;In 2015, we kept hearing the same request. It went something like: “I love your computer backup service, but I also need a place to store data for other reasons—backing up servers, hosting files, and building applications. Can you give me direct access to your storage?” We listened, and we built Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build on my own words from the time, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/b2-cloud-storage-provider/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;It. Was. HUGE.&lt;/a&gt;” B2 Cloud Storage fundamentally changed the trajectory of our company. Over just the past two years, we’ve added more customer data than we did in our entire first decade. We now have customers in over 160 countries and they’ve entrusted us with more than an exabyte of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands like &lt;strong&gt;American Public Television, Patagonia, and Verizon’s Complex Networks&lt;/strong&gt;—alongside more than 100,000 other customers—use Backblaze B2 to back up and archive their data; host their files online; offload their NAS, SAN, and other storage systems; replace their aging tape infrastructure; and as the store for the applications they’ve built. Many of them have told us how the low cost enabled them to do what they wouldn’t have been able to, and the simplicity to do it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m proud that we’ve been able to help customers by offering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/transparency-in-cloud-storage-costs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;most affordable download prices&lt;/a&gt; in the industry, making it easy to migrate from the cloud oligarchy, and offering unprecedented choice in how our customers use their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m thrilled to announce the public beta launch of our most requested feature: &lt;strong&gt;S3 Compatible APIs for B2 Cloud Storage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have wanted to use B2 Cloud Storage but your application or device didn’t support it, or you wanted to move to cloud storage in general but couldn’t afford it, you should be able to instantly start with the new S3 Compatible APIs for Backblaze B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Backblaze B2 via our S3 Compatible APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this launch means that you can now instantly plug into the Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage service by doing little more than pointing your data to a new destination. There’s no need to write new code, no change in workflow, and no downtime. Our S3 Compatible APIs are ready to use, and our solutions engineering team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/contact-sales.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ready to help you get started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they’re not alone. We have a number of launch partners leveraging our S3 Compatible APIs so you can use B2 Cloud Storage. These partners include &lt;strong&gt;IBM Aspera, Quantum, and Veeam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;abstract&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Official Launch Partners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinnafilm, IBM Aspera, Igneous, LucidLink, Marquis, Masstech, Primestream, Quantum, Scale Logic, Storage Made Easy, Studio Network Solutions, Veeam, Venera Technologies, Vidispine, Xendata. These companies join a list of more than 100 other software, hardware, and cloud companies already offering Backblaze B2 to support their customers’ cloud storage needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenging the Cloud Oligarchy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For too long, cloud storage has been an oligarchy, leaving customers with choices that all look the same: expensive, opaque, complicated. We pride ourselves on being simple, reliable, and affordable. As &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; magazine put it recently, B2 Cloud Storage is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/202004/burt-helm/backblaze-cloud-data-storage-backup-low-cost-unlimited.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Everything Amazon’s AWS Isn’t.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With B2 Cloud Storage S3 Compatible APIs, we’re making the choice for something different a no-brainer. While there are all new ways to use Backblaze B2, our pricing is unchanged. We remain the affordability leader, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;our prices&lt;/a&gt; have nothing to hide. With Backblaze, customers don’t need to choose what data they actually use—all data is instantly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re opening this new pathway to B2 Cloud Storage, it doesn’t mean we’re changing anything about the service you already love. Our Native APIs are still performant, elegant, and supported. We’re just paving the way for more of you to see what it feels like when a cloud storage solution works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon locks down internal employee communications amid organizing efforts</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/29/21240049/amazon-internal-corporate-employee-backlash-email-listservs-worker-activism-coronavirus</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/29/21240049/amazon-internal-corporate-employee-backlash-email-listservs-worker-activism-coronavirus</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;4NcC3g&quot;&gt;Amazon’s corporate employees have started to question the e-commerce giant’s business and labor practices more than ever before. In response, the company appears to be cracking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;G4CQ01&quot;&gt;This week, Recode has learned that Amazon has started strictly enforcing rules that limit its employees’ internal communications with each other on several large company email listservs, where workers have been criticizing how the company is treating its warehouse workers during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19&quot;&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; pandemic and have organized protests in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Wp9gYo&quot;&gt;On Monday, Amazon’s IT department notified some employees who manage listservs of more than 500 people that they are required to have employee moderators pre-approve any posts on their mailing lists — a rule that the company says previously existed but several sources told Recode was rarely enforced until now. Employees who create or manage listservs can pick who they want to designate as the moderators, but those moderators have to be an “L6” manager-level employee or above, limiting the gatekeepers of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4AT0Nv&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for Amazon said that its policies about moderating large email lists are not new, but that after a routine audit, the company has started enforcing its policies for all mailing lists that either weren’t following the rules or had been previously granted exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Th208m&quot;&gt;Shortly after publication of this story, Amazon’s IT department notified Amazon employees who run large listservs that it is delaying making any changes to email moderation in order to “minimize disruption to any business-critical email lists,” per an email Recode reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;02cPFV&quot;&gt;Amazon’s listservs — which number in the thousands — are places for employees to discuss a wide range of topics, from climate change to parenting. Recently, some of these forums &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/5/21206385/amazon-fired-warehouse-worker-christian-smalls-employee-backlash-david-zapolsky-coronavirus&quot;&gt;have also become places for workers to critique&lt;/a&gt; the company’s operational handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/8/21214117/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-senator-booker-chris-smalls-senators-letter&quot;&gt;how it treats warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt;, who have asked for higher pay and more safety protections. Some inside the company see the new communications rules as a way to muzzle corporate employees who are increasingly organizing on behalf of their lower-paid colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oymSpB&quot;&gt;“It’s obviously and transparently being done to shut down employee communication,” said one corporate Amazon employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of company policies barring employees from speaking to the press without prior approval. “If we wanted to share information about a firing internally or publicize an event, we would need to convince a moderator to let us do it — and that would be mean them risking getting fired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;o9WOwM&quot;&gt;Another corporate employee who’s active on internal listservs agreed that the move appeared to be aimed at the organizers, but that there were likely other factors at play, too. Recently, there’s been a rise in employees spamming these distribution lists with other kinds of requests, the employee said, and the organizers’ mass invites were likely the final straw rather than the only reason for the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;casp3w&quot;&gt;Whether or not Amazon’s renewed enforcement of these rules is mainly meant to restrict internal activism, many Amazon employees perceive it that way. They worry that the company’s recent actions will be a barrier to having meaningful discussion on important topics like warehouse worker rights and the company’s environmental policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zvR1et&quot;&gt;Amazon did not respond to a request for comment specifically about concerns that the rules are limiting employees’ speech on working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;abgIHJ&quot;&gt;In recent weeks, hundreds of Amazon warehouse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/20/amazon-warehouse-workers-plan-national-coronavirus-protest.html&quot;&gt;employees at more than 50 sites around the US&lt;/a&gt; have participated in protesting working conditions during the pandemic, demanding greater pay, access to protective gear, and more generous time-off policies. Amazon’s corporate employees have used listservs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/5/21206385/amazon-fired-warehouse-worker-christian-smalls-employee-backlash-david-zapolsky-coronavirus&quot;&gt;share their dismay over the escalating labor disputes&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/22/21231695/amazon-employees-corporate-warehouse-sickout-protest-organizing-event-invitation-disappeared&quot;&gt;organize events that bring together&lt;/a&gt; blue-collar and white-collar workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;iS745n&quot;&gt;In turn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/14/21220899/amazon-fired-activist-employees-warehouse-conditions-emily-cunningham-bashir-mohamed-maren-costa&quot;&gt;the company has fired&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice&quot;&gt;at least six employees&lt;/a&gt; involved in recent protests — including two longtime corporate employees, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa. Cunningham and Costa were prominent leaders of an internal climate activism group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), with an active listserv of more than 8,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4jnAYt&quot;&gt;Last Friday, AECJ members used dozens of Amazon internal listservs to invite thousands of their colleagues to skip work in a mass sickout and instead attend a virtual panel discussion about Amazon warehouse working conditions and environmental policies. Although the invites to this event &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/22/21231695/amazon-employees-corporate-warehouse-sickout-protest-organizing-event-invitation-disappeared&quot;&gt;mysteriously disappeared from workers’ calendars&lt;/a&gt; and two organizers were fired for organizing a similar event the week prior, it went on as planned with more than 300 people attending virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GwyGkX&quot;&gt;With the new enforcement about these rules on email communications, employees say it will be impossible for workers to use listservs to mobilize their colleagues in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yMNIKN&quot;&gt;“Everyone seems to acknowledge (subtly or overtly) that this was in response to the employees getting fired and the sickout,” another Amazon employee told Recode. “I think part of what Amazon is trying to do is make average employees upset at AECJ because of this new inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FSVuth&quot;&gt;Aside from the concerns about censorship of discussions about worker rights, several employees have also expressed concern in internal emails about how the rules will slow down forums dedicated to supporting underrepresented employee groups. Many of the most popular listservs at Amazon are ones for women in engineering and racial minorities who work at the company to virtually convene and support each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nh3SRE&quot;&gt;In an internal email one employee moderator sent to a listerv for discussing diversity and inclusion, the employee acknowledged that additional requirements will cause a “slower flow of communication” and that the moderation team may start rejecting certain emails, which will be “a very different dynamic” for the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5bfkSS&quot;&gt;Last year, Amazon’s tech giant peer Google similarly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/23/20829430/google-new-community-guidelines-employees-political-speech-internal-debate&quot;&gt;limited employee speech on internal forums&lt;/a&gt; following a rise in worker activism. While the move was met with a fair share of criticism, the crackdown ultimately was not enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/21/20924697/google-unionization-switzerland-zurich-syndicom-zooglers&quot;&gt;stop workers from continuing to organize&lt;/a&gt; and publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent&quot;&gt;leak controversial company initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to Google, the recent organizing on Amazon’s internal forums is relatively new to Amazon’s buttoned-up workplace culture, particularly on the corporate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UVb8Vf&quot;&gt;If moderators of employee discussions find the policies too laborious, they could move the discussion to off-corporate platforms, as tens of thousands of Amazon warehouse workers have done in private Facebook groups. And while Amazon’s decision may stop contentious worker discussions in the short term, it also draws more attention to worker organizing and signals how seemingly threatened Amazon’s management is by open discussion among its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon VP Resigns, Calls Company ‘Chickenshit’ for Firing Protesting Workers</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bjpj/amazon-vp-tim-bray-resigns-calls-company-chickenshit-for-firing-protesting-workers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bjpj/amazon-vp-tim-bray-resigns-calls-company-chickenshit-for-firing-protesting-workers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tim Bray, a well known senior engineer and Vice President at Amazon has “quit in dismay” because Amazon has been “firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.” In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an open letter on his website&lt;/a&gt;, Bray, who has worked at the company for nearly six years, called the company “chickenshit” for firing and disparaging employees who have organized protests. He also said the firings are &quot;designed to create a climate of fear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s strategy throughout the coronavirus crisis has been to fire dissenters and disparage them both in the press and behind closed doors. There have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jge77g/hundreds-of-amazon-workers-are-not-going-to-work-in-nationwide-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dozens of confirmed coronavirus cases&lt;/a&gt; at warehouses around the country, and workers have repeatedly said the company isn’t doing enough to protect them. Last week, Amazon ended a program that allowed workers to take unlimited unpaid time off if they fear getting sick from the coronavirus. Last Friday, Amazon workers together with Target, FedEx, Instacart, and Whole Foods workers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7j8zw/amazon-whole-foods-instacart-workers-organize-a-historic-mass-strike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went on strike&lt;/a&gt; to protest their working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statements to Motherboard, Amazon has said its own protesting workers are “spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,” and that it “objects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups.” Last month, Amazon fired Chris Smalls, an Amazon worker in New York City. In a meeting, Amazon executives said that they believe Smalls is not “smart or articulate,” and that publicly they would focus on “laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal,” according to leaked notes from that meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obtained by VICE News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his resignation letter, Bray said that “firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bray is the highest-level (now former) Amazon employee to speak out about the company’s workplace culture and treatment of its workers. He has been well-known in the software engineering world for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, he was the highest-ranking employee to sign an open letter promoting a shareholders’ resolution calling for climate action at the company, which continues to work with fossil fuel companies. A total of 8,702 employees signed that letter. Bray has previously been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/trans-mountain-nationalization-a-grave-mistake-open-text-co-founder~1406874&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrested for protesting&lt;/a&gt; the Trans-Mountain Pipeline in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Amazon fired two employees who helped organize a climate walkout around the time of that letter, Bray said he “snapped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“VPs shouldn’t go publicly rogue, so I escalated through the proper channels and by the book,” he wrote. He said that he decided to quit in solidarity with those who have been fired. “Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on the actions I despised. So I resigned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The victims weren’t abstract entities but real people; here are some of their names: Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Maren Costa, Emily Cunningham, Bashir Mohammed, and Chris Smalls,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon declined to comment on Bray's letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This post has been updated to note that Amazon declined to comment on Bray's letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Analyzing pitches to find what gets VCs interested in a meeting</title>
<link>https://www.feedback.vc/venture-capital-advice/this-is-what-gets-a-vc-interested-in-a-meeting</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.feedback.vc/venture-capital-advice/this-is-what-gets-a-vc-interested-in-a-meeting</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve processed over 500 double-blind pitches so far and looked to see what was driving success. Companies don’t submit anything personally identifiable about the founders or their business. They share what they do, not who they are (other than high-level team bios).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the other side, an anonymous panel of VCs reviews every company. At the end, they have the option to opt into a direct introduction. The purpose of the platform is really organizing and standardizing the feedback for founders. The intros are a nice, but not guaranteed, side benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We analyzed the results of our first 500 reviews and calculated the correlations between high marks in categories like team, problem area and business economics with the number of requested intros from our reviewing VCs. Overall, high scores on the review were a strong predictor of VC interest, but the results of the scores of the individual categories might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s what mattered—and what didn’t, in order of least to most predictive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product &amp;amp; Solution - Weak Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It has been said that “ideas are a dime a dozen” and that seems to be the case with VCs. The investors who gave high marks on solutions only showed a slight interest in asking for a founder intro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Raise - Weak Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Am I raising too little or too much? Am I going to signal something unintentionally based on what I’m asking for? It didn’t really really matter much to our investors. On many occasions, they looked past issues they had with the raise, seemingly because if they got interested in the company, they could influence what they saw as the right amount for the raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team - Moderate Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Team. Team. Team? Yeah, perhaps a good team isn’t everything. Some good teams got lots of intros and others, not so much. On the flip side, there were no good teams that got zero intros. Bad teams definitely sunk your chances—but having a great team didn’t necessarily mean lots of VCs wanted to meet you if they didn’t like the other aspects of your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Basics &amp;amp; Gut Check - Moderate Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We ask teams to to briefly describe what they’re working on, and then we ask VCs for a gut check on this high-level overview. This was a pretty decent predictor—which means that the next time you’re networking with VCs, if they don’t show interest after that first one liner, you might be better off politely excusing yourself than trying to stay and win them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or, maybe get a more enticing one-liner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis - Moderate Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Agreeing on how you see the world is important—but deciding what’s important about how you see the world is just as critical. We asked founders to state three beliefs that any investor who got to the finish line would have to agree with. Some founders who scored a lot of investor intros had high agreement with these stated principals. Others who scored high in this area didn’t get more than a couple of investors kicking the tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We can both agree that the sky is blue, but that doesn’t mean this will make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem &amp;amp; Market Segment - Moderate to Strong Predictor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This would have been a stronger predictor had it not been for a few outliers at the top. Aside from a few companies who got a high number of intros despite scoring relatively low here, this was overall a very good predictor of who get intros. Picking the right problem to work on seemed more important than having the right solution by more than 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what was the most important factor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which area, if a VC only knew one thing about your company, was the most predictive of enticing a VC to want to meet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some founders might be disappointed, because its that age old question that they love to hate…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“How does it make money??”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yes, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the underlying economics of the business was the strongest predictor of whether a VC wanted an intro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; over any other aspect of the company. Founders who could clearly articulate an economic opportunity fared really well with investor interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus: Gender Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our submissions remove any personally identifiable information about the founders—so our investors don’t know which teams have male or female founders. However, it was interesting that women, on average, scored 13% more intros on our platform. That may be because their scores were higher overall—especially in the team area, where they were voted 30% better than their male counterparts when the genders were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founders!&lt;/strong&gt; Are you about to fundraise or in the middle of it? Get the honest, actionable feedback you need from real VCs. Our 8-page Feedback Report aggregates quantitative data and qualitative feedback (i.e. personal comments) on your company from an anonymous panel of VCs—and for a limited time, it’s 50% off. &lt;strong&gt;Just use the code FOUNDER50.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
