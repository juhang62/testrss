<title>We have to talk about this Python, Gunicorn, Gevent thing</title>
<link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/03/07/costly/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Even if you're in a terrible situation, you should probably try to learn from it. You never know if your purpose in life is to actually serve as a warning to others as that &quot;Demotivational&quot; poster puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I will not do myself. I, for example, will not write a service in Python. I will not use web requests when the situation calls for RPCs. I will not use &quot;green&quot; (userspace) &quot;threads&quot; when there are actual OS-level threads and parallelization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had these beliefs for a while, but they weren't rooted in experience with those specific technologies. I had seen them from afar, and decided they were no good, and besides, I had other things I was using that worked better and made me happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I actually have that experience now, and I can serve as that warning. Here's what happens when you build around Python, Gunicorn, Gevent, and web requests instead of something more sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's this &quot;service&quot;, right? And it's sitting there on this box. The box has 4 CPUs so you're running 5 instances of it because someone decided the ideal situation was (num_cpus + 1). Exactly how does it get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, first up, something runs gunicorn, which does some housekeeping, sets up a listening socket and then calls fork(). Then, the children all import your &quot;app&quot; -- that is, your actual &quot;service&quot; code. Then they do some local housekeeping, twiddle epoll a little, and start waiting on that listening socket to go live. At this point, every one of your processes is sitting in the kernel, having called epoll_wait().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A connection arrives on the socket. Linux runs a pass down the list of listeners doing the epoll thing -- all of them! -- and tells every single one of them that something's waiting out there. They each wake up, one after another, a few nanoseconds apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All five processes&lt;/em&gt; call accept4(). There's only one connection waiting, so only one of them succeeds. Obviously, the first one who called it won. The first one to call it was probably the first one which was awakened by the kernel. (The kernel seems to be doing some kind of LIFO thing, so that one process keeps winning, but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner proceeds to recvfrom() on that socket to find out what they want. It's some kind of &quot;GET /blah HTTP/1.1&quot; thing. Oh, it's a web request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the other four processes have gotten -1 with errno set to EAGAIN, because - surprise! - nothing else was waiting on that socket. They sulk a little bit, kick at the pebbles by their feet, do a little housekeeping and jostle some data around, redefine their epoll sets, and call back into epoll_wait(), having burned a bit of CPU time for exactly no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation, incidentally, was dubbed the &quot;thundering herd&quot; back in the '90s when Linux people started freaking out about how Windows NT web servers were whipping Linux royally. People realized that maybe it wasn't a great idea to have every single Apache httpd blocking in accept() and then waking up at the same time. They came up with semaphore tricks and (much later) things like EPOLLONESHOT. It got better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this world, the '90s apparently never ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's carry on with this scenario. Process #1 is still running this request. It in turn has to fire something down the network to yet another &quot;service&quot;. When it does, something in the &quot;green thread&quot; libraries notices what's going on and says &quot;hey, you seem to be waiting on the network, so how about we go back for more work?&quot;. It pushes that original request aside and goes back to the epoll situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, hey, what do you know, it actually gets another connection! It does recvfrom() on it, and sees what it wants, and now it starts fulfilling this request. It involves a bit of cranking on some data. Maybe it's manipulating strings. Maybe it's reading JSON off the filesystem, and then deserializing it into local objects. Maybe it's applying translations. (Maybe it's already done this a bunch of times, and is too stupid to keep it around from the last time.) Whatever. The point is, it's now very busy with this new request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, that original request is getting old. The request it made has since received a response, but since there's not been an opportunity to flip back to it, the new request is still cooking. Eventually, that new request's computations are done, and it sends back a reply: 200 HTTP/1.1 OK, blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it does its weird userspace &quot;thread&quot; flip back to the original request's context and reads the response. It chews on this data, because, again, it's terrible JSON stuff and not anything reasonable like a strongly-typed, unambiguously, easily-deserialized message. The clock is ticking and ticking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it sends back a reply to this original request. But, oh, what's this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIGPIPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, the write() down the file descriptor for that original request returned -1 with errno=EPIPE, and it also caused a SIGPIPE signal to be fired at the process at the same time. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened is that the client got tired of waiting and bailed. It hung up the connection. With that connection dead on the network side of things, the write immediately failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service shrugs, closes down the connection, does its usual post-request cleanup stuff, and goes back to waiting with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that the client has no idea the request actually completed. It's total byzantine agreement stuff here. The client's only option now is to try it again and hope it finds someone who doesn't run away in the middle of their &quot;conversation&quot; to take care of the latest request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I sure hope these requests are idempotent...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on here? Many things. So many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within any given worker, only one thing is ever really going to execute at once. It's either handling one request or it's handing another. There's only one thread associated with this process. It's not like it can use multiple CPUs and go off and do work. These aren't OS threads, they're fake userspace threads. If one's running, the other one is waiting. If the waiting one has a tighter deadline, oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not have a bunch of workers? Just fork a crapload more than just num_cpus plus one? Well, that's another thing. All of those workers cost memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you say. fork() is copy on write. You shouldn't have all of those copies of the code. And, well, you're half right. fork() is in fact copy on write for those pages, but it's only applicable to the pages you've already loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; you probably think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back and look. I said that it forks &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; it imports your app. Your app (which is almost certainly the bulk of the code inside the Python interpreter) is not actually in memory when the fork happens. It gets loaded AFTER that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why in the hell would you fork then load, instead of load then fork?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's around this time that you discover that people have been doing naughty, nasty things, like causing work to occur at &quot;import time&quot;. That is, they have code hanging out in their .py files which is not enclosed by a function or class or whatever, such that importing it runs it. That code has side-effects. Nobody ever told them to not do that. (Clearly though, nobody's ever told them not to do anything, based on the wobbly tower of bad architectural decisions I've been describing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why they fork-then-load. That's why it takes up so much memory, and that's why you can't just have a bunch of these stupid things hanging around, each handling one request at a time and not pulling a &quot;SHINYTHING!&quot; and ignoring one just because another came in. There's just not enough RAM on the machine to let you do this. So, num_cpus + 1 it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not even going to get into the whole insanity of using web requests when you really should be using a real RPC mechanism, with, oh, you know, strongly defined data types and methods which use them, timeouts, load balancing, health checks, queue depth determination, sharding, pick-two, selective LIFO, and everything else that tends to show up given enough time in a battle-tested system. That's a rant for another post entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you keep this kind of monster running? First, you make sure you never allow it to use too much of the CPU, because empirically, it'll mean that you're getting distracted too much and are timing out some requests while chasing down others. You set your system to &quot;elastically scale up&quot; at some pitiful utilization level, like 25-30% of the &lt;em&gt;entire machine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your cloud provider loves this. They tell you: sure, run more instances! Buy our stuff to help you manage the tens of thousands of identical underutilized virtual machines that this design gives you! It'll buy our founder a lovely ivory-handled back scratcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means you have to come up with breathtaking things to deal with thousands of instances when the work could really be done with something far smaller, given a reasonable implementation. One of your friends points out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf&quot;&gt;COST paper&lt;/a&gt; and you weep silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever learned something and realized, gee, I wish I didn't know any of that? Only someone in a terrible situation should ever experience that and have to understand that? Yeah. That's me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firecracker: Secure and fast microVMs for serverless computing</title>
<link>https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services.&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;23.222305389222&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, you needed to choose between containers with fast startup times and high density, or VMs with strong hardware-virtualization-based security and workload isolation. With Firecracker, you no longer have to choose. Firecracker enables you to deploy workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which provide enhanced security and workload isolation over traditional VMs, while enabling the speed and resource efficiency of containers. Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to improve the customer experience of services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/&quot;&gt;AWS Fargate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and manage microVMs. Firecracker has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization. Firecracker currently supports Intel CPUs, with AMD and Arm support in developer preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firecracker is integrated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kata-containers/documentation/wiki/Initial-release-of-Kata-Containers-with-Firecracker-support&quot;&gt;Kata Containers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/oss/firekube/&quot;&gt;Weave FireKube&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite&quot;&gt;Weave Ignite&lt;/a&gt;), and containerd via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd&quot;&gt;firecracker-containerd&lt;/a&gt;. It's also available within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/solo-io/unik&quot;&gt;UniK&lt;/a&gt; unikernel and microVM platform. Firecracker can run Linux and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.osv.io/blog/2019/04/19/making-OSv-run-on-firecraker&quot;&gt;OSv&lt;/a&gt; guests. Our latest roadmap can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/projects/13&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google tracking a bike ride past a burglarized home made the rider a suspect</title>

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;emailSignup&quot; class=&quot;newsletter-signup-inline-container mt8 mt2-m mb8&quot; readability=&quot;6.6127167630058&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;That request triggered the Jan. 14 notice the technology giant sent to McCoy, part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests&quot;&gt;general policy on notifying users about government requests for their information.&lt;/a&gt; The notice was McCoy’s only indication that police wanted his data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Gainesville police declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;While privacy and civil liberties advocates have been concerned that geofence warrants violate constitutional protections from unreasonable searches, law enforcement authorities say those worries are overblown. They say police don’t obtain any identifying information about a Google user until they find a device that draws their suspicion. And the information alone is not enough to justify charging someone with a crime, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Google geofence warrants have been used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/nyregion/proud-boys-antifa-trial.html&quot;&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wral.com/scene-of-a-crime-raleigh-police-search-google-accounts-as-part-of-downtown-fire-probe/17340984/&quot;&gt;agencies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/02/07/google-location-police-search-warrants&quot;&gt;around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/12/11/google-gives-feds-1500-leads-to-arsonist-smartphones-in-unprecedented-geofence-search/#312f9d027dc3&quot;&gt;the country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/10/23/feds-are-ordering-google-to-hand-over-a-load-of-innocent-peoples-locations/#1947c0c45a0d&quot;&gt;including the FBI&lt;/a&gt;. Google said in a court filing last year that the requests from state and federal law enforcement authorities were increasing rapidly: by more than 1,500 percent from 2017 to 2018, and by 500 percent from 2018 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“It’s a great tool and a great technology,” said Kevin Armbruster, a retired lieutenant with the Milwaukee Police Department, where he oversaw the use of high-tech investigative work, including geofence warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;related related--single dn-print&quot; data-test=&quot;related&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;related__title&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Milwaukee police have used Google geofence warrants to solve an array of crimes, including homicides, shootings, a string of robberies and kidnappings and a sexual assault involving an abduction, he said. “I would think the majority of citizens in the world would love the fact that we are putting violent offenders in jail,” Armbruster said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;There have been very few court challenges to Google geofence warrants, mainly because the warrants are done in secret and defense lawyers may not realize the tool was used to identify their clients. One exception is an accused bank robber in Midlothian, Virginia, who is fighting the charge by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-used-google-location-data-find-accused-bank-robber-he-n1086836&quot;&gt;arguing the geofence warrant used against him was illegal&lt;/a&gt;. That case is pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Once McCoy realized his bike ride had placed him near the scene of the crime, he had a strong theory of why police had picked his device out of all the others swept up by the warrant. He and Kenyon set out to keep them from getting any more information about him ─ and persuade them that he was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Kenyon said he got on the phone with the detective on the case and told him, “You’re looking at the wrong guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;For most of his life, McCoy said, he had tried to live online anonymously, a habit that dated to the early days of the internet when there was less expectation that people would use their real names. He used pseudonyms on his social media accounts and the email account that Google used to notify him about the police investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;But until then, he hadn’t thought much about Google collecting information about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“I didn’t realize that by having location services on that Google was also keeping a log of where I was going,” McCoy said. “I’m sure it’s in their terms of service but I never read through those walls of text, and I don’t think most people do either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Just before the start of his ordeal, he’d listened to a call-in radio debate about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-seeks-apple-s-help-unlocking-phones-suspected-pensacola-naval-n1111636&quot;&gt;the Department of Justice’s fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over access to an iPhone left by a Saudi national who’d gunned down several people at an air base in Pensacola, Florida, in December. He remembered some callers saying they had no problem with law enforcement having access to phone data, arguing that people had nothing to worry about as long as they didn’t break the law. Now McCoy thought the callers weren’t considering predicaments like his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“If you’re innocent, that doesn’t mean you can’t be in the wrong place at the wrong time, like going on a bike ride in which your GPS puts you in a position where police suspect you of a crime you didn’t commit,” McCoy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;related related--single dn-print&quot; data-test=&quot;related&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;related__title&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;On Jan. 31, Kenyon filed a motion in Alachua County civil court to render the warrant “null and void” and to block the release of any further information about McCoy, identifying him only as “John Doe.” At that point, Google had not turned over any data that identified McCoy but would have done so if Kenyon hadn’t intervened. Kenyon argued that the warrant was unconstitutional because it allowed police to conduct sweeping searches of phone data from untold numbers of people in order to find a single suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;That approach, Kenyon said, flipped on its head the traditional method of seeking a search warrant, in which police target a person they already suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“This geofence warrant effectively blindly casts a net backwards in time hoping to ensnare a burglar,” Kenyon wrote. “This concept is akin to the plotline in many a science fiction film featuring a dystopian, fascist government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;The filing seemed to give law enforcement authorities second thoughts about the warrant. Not long afterward, Kenyon said, a lawyer in the state attorney’s office assigned to represent the Gainesville Police Department told him there were details in the motion that led them to believe that Kenyon’s client was not the burglar. The state attorney’s office withdrew the warrant, asserting in a court filing that it was no longer necessary. The office did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Kenyon said that in a visit to his office, the detective acknowledged that police no longer considered his client a suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;On Feb. 24, Kenyon dropped his legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;The case ended well for McCoy, Kenyon said, but “the larger privacy fight will go unanswered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;related related--single dn-print&quot; data-test=&quot;related&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;related__title&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;Even then, Kenyon wanted to make sure police didn’t have lingering doubts about McCoy, whom they still knew only as “John Doe.” So he met with the detective again and showed him screenshots of his client’s Google location history, including data recorded by RunKeeper. The maps showed months of bike rides past the burglarized home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;In the end, the same location data that raised police suspicions of McCoy also helped to vindicate him, Kenyon said. “But there was no knowing what law enforcement was going to do with that data when they got it behind closed doors. Not that I distrust them, but I wouldn’t trust them not to arrest someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;He pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html&quot;&gt;an Arizona case&lt;/a&gt; in which a man was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/google-geofence-location-data-avondale-wrongful-arrest-molina-gaeta-11426374&quot;&gt;mistakenly arrested&lt;/a&gt; and jailed for murder largely based on Google data received from a geofence warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;McCoy said he may have ended up in a similar spot if his parents hadn’t given him several thousand dollars to hire Kenyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;He regrets having to spend that money. He also thinks about the elderly burglary victim. Police said they have not made any arrests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;endmarkEnabled&quot;&gt;“I’m definitely sorry that happened to her, and I’m glad police were trying to solve it,” McCoy said. “But it just seems like a really broad net for them to cast. What’s the cost-benefit? How many innocent people do we have to harass?”&lt;/p&gt;

 Yesterday Twitter spoke and told me that I am an old man, with overwhelming decisiveness. If this has been with any more votes, I would be declared part of the vulnerable population for Corona virus, one of the expendables as people seem to refer to them.&lt;p&gt;Twitter followers... I thought we were friends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Ok, I get the point. I have seen things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1976. I understand that in the eyes of millennials 1976 is around the same time period as 1796. My son sometimes asks me if TV was invented when I was a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we had a black and white TV when I was growing up. And a dial phone, that was tethered to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 7th grade, my dad got us a Commodore 64, and I played Boulderdash, Load runner, Falcon Patrol etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 9th grade, I saw the TV broadcasting the first Gulf War. I didn't follow it, because at that time it didn't feel like Turkey was part of Middle East. Back then we thought Turkey was part of Europe. We used to call it the bridge to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, when I started college, I used the Mosaic browser. The Netscape browser arrived couple years later. My university had Sun workstations, and also black and green terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My university was named Middle East Technical University. (Yeah, somehow, I still didn't connect the dots then...) We learned Pascal, C, Lisp, ML, Prolog. C++ was new back then, the department started a C++ course when I was in my 3rd year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started an MS+PhD at The Ohio State University in 1998. My flight from Istanbul to JFK had a lot of cigarette smokers -- smoking was permitted on the planes then. My flight from JFK to Columbus was a slow propeller plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, I was among the first to use 802.11b cards and WAPs at home, because one of my roommates was working at a company developing WAPs and writing drivers for 802.11b cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen peer-to-peer networks become a thing, and then not become a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got my first cell phone in 2004. It was a Motorola Razr. I didn't like it... I didn't have much use for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007 iPhone was released, and I bought one. I liked the iPhone a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have seen things, but that doesn't make me old. It was interesting times, and I feel lucky I got to see computers and information technologies taking off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not having a Facebook account doesn't make me old.  I am a Twitter person, I never saw much point in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to come clean and say it. I never watched the Game of Thrones, not a single episode. I just know that winter is involved (learned this from Twitter memes), and there is a red wedding where a lot of people died (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b01/a0be5dadcc92d2ee00d6842452d8c6354319.pdf?_ga=2.31967934.104007056.1583540832-724371247.1582688894&quot;&gt;learned this from this CS paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you miss a lot of things in popular culture, you may start to become irrelevant. But I think missing a couple things is OK. I don't want to be the same as everyone else. &quot;If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.&quot; -- Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to delay old age, I try to start new things and get involved in new experiences. Entropy is hard to beat, I know. But, not today old age, not today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M73fwzJZFwM/XmLw3rsuSeI/AAAAAAAAImE/GOkWK0UwAskdkfZAjh2uMu-KBPIdg1b3gCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/crop.php.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M73fwzJZFwM/XmLw3rsuSeI/AAAAAAAAImE/GOkWK0UwAskdkfZAjh2uMu-KBPIdg1b3gCK4BGAYYCw/s320/crop.php.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;180&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<title>The Brave browser is brilliant, but probably not for the reasons you think</title>

<description>&lt;section&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2020-03-06T15:16:00.000Z&quot;&gt;2020-03-06&lt;/time&gt; (posted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rudism.com/tech&quot;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;But-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think…&quot;&gt;But probably not for the reasons you think…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in grade school (I believe it was grade 7, which would put this somewhere around 1994 or 1995), I created my own currency. It was called Daddy-O dollars, and was minted with pen on post-it notes. Each bill sported a crude drawing of a spiky-haired kid with sunglasses in the middle and the monetary value written at each of the four corners. There was no printing press–each bill was lovingly hand-crafted by me, sitting at the desk in my room over the course of a single night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood that the little drawings of my Daddy-O mascot, divided into piles of various denominations (1DD, 5DDs, 10DDs, and so-on), had no actual value in terms of real dollars. I knew that I couldn’t simply show up at school the next day and expect people to give me stuff in exchange for a bunch of worthless post-it notes. But that was OK, because I had a cunning plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I snuck down to the basement where my younger brother and I kept all of our toys, and gathered up some of what I considered to be my brother’s best stuff. Ninja Turtle figures, GI-JOEs, cap guns, board games, books, and all kinds of knick knacks. Along with my brother’s toys, I gathered a healthy supply of unhealthy snacks from the kitchen pantry. I shoved the goods into my backpack, topped them off with my fat stack of Daddy-O dollars, and dreamed all night of the riches that would undoubtedly soon be mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Let’s-Talk-about-Brave&quot;&gt;Let’s Talk about Brave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about the Brave browser, it’s a fork of Chromium–the same open source browser that serves as the foundation for Google Chrome. It blocks ads by default and claims to be focused on speed and privacy. The general consensus, when reading various reviews and opinions of it around the internet, seems to be that it excels on both of those fronts. I am personally skeptical of some of these reviews (for reasons that I will expand on later in this article) and of whether the speed and privacy gains go beyond what you could already experience by using ad blocking and privacy extensions for Google Chrome or Firefox. But that’s not the focus of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of this article is on the other feature of Brave that distinguishes it from other web browsers: its built-in advertising network and Ethereum-based crypto token exchange system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into this, I’ll state that I don’t use Brave, I’m not affiliated with Brave or any other web browser in any way, nor do I have any information about Brave that can’t be gleaned through normal web searches. Everything I’m stating here is my personal opinion and if I get something wrong (which I probably will) I will make my best effort to update this article in a transparent way to reflect the truth. (The story about Daddy-O dollars is true to the best of my recollection of the incident, which is hazy at best.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Brave blocks ads on websites that you visit, you have the option of joining something called “Brave Rewards” which, bizarrely, opts you in to viewing ads generated by the browser itself. The pitch to sell this feature to users is multi-faceted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ads being blocked on the websites you visit are not respectful of your privacy, but the ads selected and displayed by Brave are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave will reward you for simply browsing the web by “paying” you and the websites you visit in the form of crypto tokens called “Basic Attention Tokens” or BAT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the ability to further support your favorite websites by “tipping” some of your BAT to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds pretty neat on the surface, right? You’re going to be browsing the web anyway; you’re going to be inundated with ads anyway; why not get paid to do it and have the opportunity to directly support the websites you like in the process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at how this disrupts the normal relationship between users, content publishers (websites), and normal ad networks (such as Google). That relationship for a user not using Brave might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rudism.com/images/brave_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I admit that this is probably an over-simplified model, it illustrates the fundamental idea. A user (that’s you) gives attention to their browser, and a content publisher provides content to the browser (by creating blog posts or news articles, for example). In order to earn money for the content they are creating, the content publisher employs an ad network. The ad network has relationships with several companies that wish to advertise their products, and those companies pay the ad network to put their ads into the web browser, and the ad network pays the content publisher for the right to do so amidst the content they have created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this model the user gets to view the content they’re seeking, the content publisher gets paid for the content by the ad network, the ad network gets paid by the advertisers, and the advertisers get paid when users find their ads interesting enough to click on and then purchase goods or services from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what that model might look like for someone using Brave with the Rewards Program activated, not yet taking into account the BAT crypto tokens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rudism.com/images/brave_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first obvious difference is that the old ad network is nowhere to be found. You may notice that the revenue stream provided to the content publisher from the missing ad network has also vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as far as I’m concerned, that’s fine. Fuck ads. I personally use an aggressive battery of ad blocking techniques to eliminate them from my browser too–the content publisher just has to suck that up as part of how the internet works now. They can cry and whine and employ pathetic ad-blocker-blocking techniques and other annoyances to ensure that they slowly fade into obscurity, or they can switch to a donation or subscription model through which users like me can support them directly. Maybe those models suck too and the whole internet is just broken now. I don’t know. I’m not particularly interested in solving that problem myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave, on the other hand, claims that fixing this broken model is its core mission. They want to foster a radical new internet advertising economy in which content providers are paid for their efforts proportionally to the share of total user attention they can attract, and users are rewarded through not only increased privacy but are actually paid a hefty chunk of the generated ad revenue themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at that second relationship diagram doesn’t seem to paint that picture, however. Notice that all the money is going from the advertisers to Brave and then nowhere else. The content publisher probably wouldn’t have seen any money either way since this particular user would likely be blocking ads even if they weren’t using Brave. But what about that poor user? He doesn’t want to see ads. He hates ads just as much as I do. Thats why he’s trying Brave out in the first place. But Brave seems to have tricked him into looking at ads anyway for no reason other than to funnel all of that sweet advertising money away from the old ad network and content publisher and straight into Brave’s pocket instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aha!” you exclaim. “What about BAT?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;What-about-BAT&quot;&gt;What about BAT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day at school I whipped open my pack in the middle of the school yard, announced loudly that I’m selling a bunch of sweet toys and junk food, and started to give free Daddy-O dollars to anyone who expressed even the slightest interest in what I was doing. Friends, friends of friends, complete strangers–everyone got a few Daddy-O dollars for free and was invited to browse the Daddy-O Shop-O’ Treats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want a bag of chips? That will be two of the Daddy-O dollars that I just handed you for free. Thanks! A pack of gum? That will be one Daddy-O dollar. Oh you didn’t get any Daddy-O dollars? Here’s three on the house! The cheaper food items and the junkier of my brother’s toys quickly flew off the proverbial shelves, leaving just a few big-ticket items in my pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How much for that cap gun?” a kid named Graham asked me. This is the moment I’d been waiting for. In my mind I was twirling my handlebar mustache and cackling. Several other kids who had been eyeing the remaining toys–including the cap gun and several action figures–turned to me expectantly, anxiously clutching what few post-it notes they still had in their greasy little palms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, that?” I replied calmly. “Seventy five Daddy-O dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was already aware that Graham could not afford this. None of the kids could. The most I handed out to any one kid was probably five DDs and they had all spent them on junk food, candy, and other worthless trash. Graham frowned and shook his head, then asked a question that sent shivers of glee down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I only have one left, how do I get more?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I’d be willing to buy stuff of yours for Daddy-O dollars, if you’ve got anything worth selling,” I said. Several kids opened their own back packs and started rooting around, and I was grinning like the Cheshire Cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Daddy-O-Dollars-and-Crypto-Tokens&quot;&gt;Daddy-O Dollars and Crypto Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep in mind that I didn’t understand a lick about any of this prior to doing a minimum of research for this article specifically, so my understanding may be incomplete or flawed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to create your own crypto token based on the Ethereum blockchain (same as BAT), here are the basic steps that would seem to be involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come up with a name for your token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a symbol for your token that would show up on crypto exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide how many tokens you want to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an ERC-20 smart contract that defines all of the above with some boilerplate code to handle balance lookups and transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, step 4 may sound daunting, especially for a non-programmer, but it can be done in under 50 lines of code, and probably just copy-and-pasted from an existing one with minor tweaks. It’s really not that hard. There are five minute video tutorials on YouTube that show you how to create crypto tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating tokens is easy. And as implied in step 3, you can make as many as you want. Brave created 1.5 billion BAT just like that with the stroke of a keyboard. I probably spent way more time drawing my little Daddy-O dude on post-it notes than it took them to do that. The difficulty, obviously, lies in generating value for your crypto tokens–getting people to want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s throw BAT into our relationship diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rudism.com/images/brave_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;diagram 3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly once a month, Brave sends some BAT to the user as a reward for looking at ads. The user can choose to send some of that BAT back to Brave to hold on to for their favorite publishers to claim, but in order to actually claim that BAT the publisher must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;be aware that Brave and BAT is a thing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;register for a publisher account and BAT wallet with Brave;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and comply with a bunch of terms and policies dictated by Brave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest; at least at present and for the distant foreseeable future, the percentage of content publishers taken as a whole across the entire internet who will actually receive any BAT for their content is negligible enough to be effectively zero. So while Brave is extending a purple BAT arrow toward the content publisher, in reality that’s just going straight back to a pool of BAT that Brave calls the “User Growth Pool” or UGP. I did leave a few purple crumbs for savvy content publishers to scoop up in the diagram, but they are almost certainly not to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BAT in the UGP, which I assume is just another wallet controlled by Brave, are given away to new users as an incentive to start using the Brave browser. This is in Brave’s interest, as more eye balls means more of that money flowing in from the advertisers. This is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; also where the BAT comes from for their referral program, through which a Brave user who writes a positively glowing review of the browser could entice other users to download and use Brave using their referral link and earn themselves some extra BAT. This is what I was referring to earlier when I mentioned I didn’t fully trust all of the reviews and articles out there raving about Brave’s incredible speed and ad-blocking capabilities–most of the ones I came across had referral links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other thing that BAT adds to the relationship is the ability for users to also give their money to Brave in exchange for BAT. I suppose this is for those users who wish to make the gesture of donating BAT to content publishers without having to look at Brave’s ads, though, as mentioned, in reality are likely just donating it back to the UGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is BAT worth anything? Why do people want it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In grade 7 I generated value for my Daddy-O dollars by giving them away for free, then selling a bunch of stuff that didn’t actually have any value to me so that other kids would perceive them as valuable. I kept the lion’s share of Daddy-O dollars to myself so that I could then use them to buy things that did have value to me from other kids. I was literally printing my own money, controlling my own economy, and trading ridiculous little post-it note doodles for actual tangible goods like digital watches and Far Side comic books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave is certainly giving away BAT for free–that’s the whole purpose of the UGP, but I don’t entirely understand where the value is coming from. I have anecdotal evidence from a Brave user who earned around $25 worth of BAT (at current exchange rates) from just browsing the web normally over the course of a month. The idea that a single user browsing the web could have earned Brave anywhere near $25 in ad revenue is (coming from someone who &lt;a href=&quot;https://rudism.com/exploiting-android-users-for-fun-and-profit/&quot;&gt;worked in the ad industry&lt;/a&gt; for a couple years) completely absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just the hype around the lofty vision that Brave espouses in its marketing material? The idea of an ad network that respects privacy and pays both content publishers and consumers of that content is certainly appealing, right up there in too-good-to-be-true territory. Or maybe the kind of user who seeks out third party ad-blocking web browsers is also inclined to get excited and perceive value in a new crypto currency just for the sake of having a new crypto currency? I don’t know. I do know that if I were in Brave’s position–taking ad revenue from advertisers, not paying any of that to the publishers of the content over which I display the ads, and controlling a whole secondary crypto economy which serves as yet another potential source of revenue–well, let’s just say my Cheshire Cat grin would probably start hurting my face muscles after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, some teachers at my junior high caught wind of the ridiculous economy I had created. They contacted my parents and I was made to destroy my remaining stash of Daddy-O dollars and return all of the stuff I had bought from other kids. I also had to pay restitution to my brother by giving him some of my toys to replace the ones of his that I had sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My little scheme didn’t really play out as I had imagined. Will Brave’s? I don’t know. I just know that I’m not going to use their browser any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netlify raises $53M Series C as microservices approach to web development grows</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, the startup that wants to kill the web server and change the way developers build websites, announced a $53 million Series C today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/eqtventures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;eqtventures&quot;&gt;EQT Ventures&lt;/a&gt; Fund led the round with contributions from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins and newcomer Preston-Werner Ventures. Under the terms of the deal Laura Yao, deal partner and investment advisor at EQT Ventures will be joining the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/netlify&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;netlify&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; board. The startup has now raised $97 million, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many startups recently, Netlify’s co-founder Chris Bach says they weren’t looking for new funding, but felt with the company growing rapidly, it would be prudent to take the money to help continue that growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Bach and CEO Matt Biilmann didn’t want to discuss valuation, they said it was “very generous” and in line with how they see their business. Neither did they want to disclose specific revenue figures, but did say that the company has tripled revenue three years running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing fueling that growth is the sheer number of developers joining the platform. When we spoke to the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/netlify-just-got-30-million-to-change-the-way-developers-build-websites/&quot;&gt;for its Series B&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, it had 300,000 sign-ups. Today that number has ballooned to 800,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrote about the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/netlify-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-web-developers-to-use-aws-lambda-event-triggers/&quot;&gt;in a 2018 article&lt;/a&gt;, it wants to change the way people develop web sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Netlify has abstracted away the concept of a web server, which it says is slow to deploy and hard to secure and scale. By shifting from a monolithic website to a static front end with back-end microservices, it believes it can solve security and scaling issues and deliver the site much faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While developer popularity is a good starting point, getting larger customers on board is the ultimate goal that will drive more revenue, and the company wants to use its new injection of capital to build the enterprise side of the business. Current enterprise customers include Google, Facebook, Citrix and Unilever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify has grown from 38 to 97 employees since the beginning of last year and hopes to reach 180 by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A googol-to-one gear ratio [video]</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate being alive for a billion seconds, Daniel Bruin built a machine with 100 gears with a 10-to-1 gear ratio…meaning that the overall gear ratio is a googol-to-one. (A googol is 1 with 100 zeros.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;widescreen embedded&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFslB0AcVmM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine has a gear reduction of 1 to 10 a hundred times. In order to get the last gear to turn once you’ll need to spin the first one a google [sic] amount around. Or better said you’ll need more energy than the entire known universe has to do that. That boggles my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the machine spin for an hour — it’s kinda relaxing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruin says his machine was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/15/02/machine-with-concrete&quot;&gt;Arthur Ganson’s Machine with Concrete&lt;/a&gt;, a contraption whose gears spin so slowly that the final gear is embedded in concrete.

&lt;div class=&quot;n em en eo ep&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o n&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sia.tech/@davidvorick?source=post_page-----8a34043e93bb----------------------&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;David Vorick&quot; class=&quot;r eq er es&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*VyyA44ch6zcB8qyyPpql6A.png&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8d5f&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;One of the frequent claims of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sia.tech&quot; class=&quot;cp fx hu hv hw hx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sia&lt;/a&gt; network is that over the long term, storage will be cheaper than $2 / TB / Mo, assuming that storage economics do not change. Though we’ve claimed this many times, we’ve never published a detailed model explaining where this number comes from. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e6c7&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;For the purposes of this model, we are going to be assuming an endgame where Sia has substantially outgrown all of the latent / unused storage in the world, where the only way Sia can continue to grow is by having new datacenters established for the sole purpose of profiting from selling data to the Sia network. You can follow along with the math using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hGc-DHftI5c9zgJuyfKpQZJPQJfam_TN2tK8qxCzeg4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; class=&quot;cp fx hu hv hw hx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;2022&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj ik hl il hn im hp in hr io ht dl&quot;&gt;One of the key ways that the Sia network distinguishes itself from traditional cloud storage is its datacenter architecture and requirements. The Sia network only expects hosts to have a 95–98% uptime. Despite this, the Sia network is able to achieve 99.9999% uptime for files. This is because each piece of data on the Sia network is stored on many hosts, requiring only a subset of them to be online in order for the file to remain available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ef23&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Today, data is typically stored on the Sia network with a 10-of-30 redundancy scheme. This means that there’s a 3x overhead, and that as long as &lt;strong class=&quot;hi ip&quot;&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; 10 hosts are online, the file itself is still retrievable. Once the Sia network is more mature, we will likely be switching to 64-of-96 hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9d08&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;If we assume that the 30 hosts go offline independently, and each host has a 95% chance of being online over a given time interval, the equation to determine the probability that a file is unavailable looks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+of+%2830+choose+x%29+*+0.95%5Ex+*+%281-0.95%29%5E%2830-x%29%2C+from+1+to+10&quot; class=&quot;cp fx hu hv hw hx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;like this,&lt;/a&gt; giving a result of 10^-19, or 18 nines of uptime. Practically speaking host failures are not truly independent and you have to account for black swan situations like world war three. The true reality is that no system actually hits 18 nines of uptime (nor 11 nines of reliability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2a49&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Amazingly, even though 64-of-96 is only 1.5x redundancy, exactly half of the total copies of 10-of-30, the uptime equation has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+of+%2896+choose+x%29+*+0.95%5Ex+*+%281-0.95%29%5E%2896-x%29%2C+from+1+to+64&quot; class=&quot;cp fx hu hv hw hx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a nearly identical result&lt;/a&gt; — 17 nines of uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1f12&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;In Sia’s endgame, 1.5x redundancy is the number that is most likely to be used in production contexts, so that is the number we are going to be using when we model the long term cost of storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d48a&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;What’s going here is we’re buying 32 HDDs, and then finding a low cost way to put them together. This is a technique that was championed by the Bitcoin mining industry, with unprecedented levels of corner cutting, bitcoin mining farms were able to get prices to be absurdly low. We can employ the same strategies here. With 95% uptime requirements, we don’t need to splurge on expensive parts like a full computer tower. The mobo selected above supports 48 gbps in data transfer, which means we still end up with over 1gbps per HDD even though we are doing a ton of splitting. It also turns out that 32 HDDs only consume 200w, so the 750w PSU we picked is more than sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3f55&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;In total, we’re spending $4945 to get a rig with 192 TB, or about $26/TB. And this is all paying consumer prices. This rig was assembled using consumer parts, when buying a large number of rigs at scale, a datacenter should be able to get much better pricing. So we will be using a rig cost of $4500 in our spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;5cb7&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Often times for datacenter buildout, you budget around $1mm per megawatt in costs, or about $1 per watt. These rigs are going to consume about 400w each (6 watts per HDD, 65 for the CPU, 70 for RAM and mobo, and then loss from the PSU and datacenter PUE). In total, that means budgeting about $500 in capex for datacenter buildout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;659c&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Another cost that needs to be considered is networking equipment. If we’re assuming that you can fit about 8 machines per rack, and you need $2,000 of networking equipment in the datacenter per rack, you get $250 per rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9dce&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Finally, everything is going to have to be assembled and constructed. Including screws and such, each rig has in the ballpark of 400 parts. That means about 2 hours of labor per rig. We’ll call that $50, bringing our total buildout expenses to $800 per rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;9824&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj ik hl il hn im hp in hr io ht dl&quot;&gt;The whole purpose of understanding capex for the purposes of a profitable datacenter build is to model depreciation. We need to understand how much value we are losing on our hardware every year that the datacenter is in operation. Hard drives last on average about 7 years. Hard drives also go down in price over time, meaning that you lose value a little faster than hard drives break. For this example, we are going to assume a 15% depreciation rate on our storage rigs, and a 5% depreciation on our build-out. That means our total depreciation costs are $785 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f94b&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Investors putting money into datacenter buildout are going to expect to make more revenue than just operational costs and depreciation costs. I think a reasonable profit expectation for a datacenter built to support a mature Sia ecosystem is around 10%, because the risk of building storage for a mature platform should be relatively low. Earlier in the life of the Sia network, risk may be higher, therefore profit requirements may be higher. At 10% profit expectation, the rigs will need to earn $570 per year in profit to be considered a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;1bcc&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Our rig takes up about 2 square feet. The shelf that I linked should actually be able to hold about 3 of these rigs, and should be able to stack 3 or more of these shelves together. If you account for leaving space for airflow and aisles, you end up with about 1 square foot per rig, meaning a 2,000 square foot datacenter can hold 200,000 TB. The cost of rent is going to be negligible compared to other expenses, and is therefore excluded. Electricity aside, utilities should be approximately negligible as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;62df&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;If we assume a PSU efficiency of 93% (this is easily attained at datacenters) and a PUE of 1.4 (generally attainable for this type of setup), you get about 400w per rig. Mining farms often have electricity costs at low as 4 cents, but Sia datacenters are restricted by the fact that they need to have access to good network connections, so we will budget 10 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. At 500 watts per rig, this comes out to $450 per year in electricity expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5cfb&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;On Sia, bandwidth is priced separately, renters pay for upload bandwidth and download bandwidth independently from storage, which means that we can exclude all ISP costs from this equation. Those expenses are covered as renters utilize the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b19c&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Typical datacenters often have multiple redundant power agreements, backup power setups, batteries, etc, so that they can maintain 99.99% uptime. They will also have technical staff at the datacenter 24/7 to react quickly to any failures or outages. None of these things are required when your uptime target is 95%, and therefore this is a huge set of costs we can ignore when designing Sia datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51c9&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Sia datacenters will however need at least a bit of maintenance. For a 32 HDD system, you expect about 5 drives to fail per year. This takes time to repair and you will need on-site staff (just not 24/7). To account for these costs, we will budget $50 per year per rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f168&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;All told, we are at about $1850 per year in expected revenue. This combines the depreciation costs, the electricity costs, the utility costs, and the profit requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;5be0&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj ik hl il hn im hp in hr io ht dl&quot;&gt;A mature datacenter should be able to maintain a utilization of 90% or more by purchasing equipment on an as-needed basis. Assuming that a datacenter does achieve 90% utilization, a 192 TB storage rig is going to need to earn all of its revenue on only 172 TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;011f&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;Something that is unique to the Sia network is collateral lockup. When hosting someone’s data, you need to lock up collateral to retain that data. When storing 172 TB of data, a host should expect to have about 6 months worth of revenue locked up. At a 10% profit expectation, that comes down to losing about 1 month worth of revenue to capital expenses per year on actively used storage. So really, we should only be counting 11 months of revenue, as that 12th month is going to pay for our collateral lockup expenses. We compute the collateral expenses as a number of months lost because it can be computed independently of other values this way and simplifies the math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a895&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;The final expense is the siafund fee. All storage on the network incurs a roughly 10% fee, which means the renter is going to be paying more than the host is earning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bcac&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj ik hl il hn im hp in hr io ht dl&quot;&gt;With a total revenue requirement of about $1750, an effective utilization of about 172 TB, and an effective earnings period of 11 months, we compute that the host needs to be earning about 90 cents per TB per month in revenue for an investment to make sense. Accounting for siafund fees, the renter needs to pay about $1.00 per TB per month. And then accounting for 1.5x redundancy, the final cost of redundant storage is about &lt;strong class=&quot;hi ip&quot;&gt;$1.50 per TB per month&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;34f3&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;This is possible because the Sia network is designed so that datacenters can take shortcuts while building. The traditional model for the cloud assumes that datacenters need to be ultra high reliability, and often also assumes certain performance requirements on the internal network and servers of the datacenter. Sia is much more relaxed, everything needs to happen on the order of milliseconds as opposed to microseconds, and is perfectly comfortable with datacenters and storage rigs that have over a day of downtime per month on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1bd6&quot; class=&quot;hg hh dt at hi b hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht dl&quot;&gt;More to the point, as a whole the Sia network has been carefully designed to be optimal as a decentralized system. Many of the fundamental design choices for Sia had to be different to achieve decentralization, and we have been able to leverage the strengths and weaknesses of these requirements to create something entirely new, and ultimately far superior to the traditional cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 23, YC will host our 30th Demo Day online. With the growing concern over COVID-19, we believe this is the right thing to do for the safety of all attendees, including our team, founders, investors, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we won’t be able to recreate every aspect of Demo Day, we’ll try our best to create an amazing experience for our founders and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations will be pre-recorded and released to all investors at the same time on Monday, March 23 on our Demo Day website. We will also provide additional written background information on each company and access to their decks. Finally, our software will make it easy for investors and founders to exchange contact information so that they can arrange one-on-one meetings. All of this will happen on the same YC Demo Day website that investors and founders have used over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, startup investors have supported every new batch of YC companies, and we know the same will be true for this batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The EARN IT act is an attack on end-to-end encryption</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators introduced a new bill called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21162983/congress-senate-earn-it-act-lindsey-graham-richard-blumenthal-section-230-encryption-bill-proposed&quot;&gt;EARN IT&lt;/a&gt; act. On its face, the bill seems like a bit of inside baseball having to do with legal liability for information service providers. In reality, it represents a sophisticated and direct governmental attack on the right of Americans to communicate privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress how dangerous this bill is, though others have &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/03/earn-it-act-here-surprise-it%E2%80%99s-still-bad-news&quot;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt;. In this post I’m going to try to do my best to explain why it scares me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Going Dark”, and the background behind EARN IT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have been pursuing an aggressive campaign to eliminate end-to-end encryption services. This is a category that includes text messaging systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/&quot;&gt;Apple’s iMessage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatsapp.com/&quot;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://telegram.org/&quot;&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;. Those services protect your data by encrypting it, and ensuring that the keys are only available to you and the person you’re communicating with. That means your provider, the person who hacks your provider, and (inadvertently) the FBI, are all left in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbi.gov/services/operational-technology/going-dark&quot;&gt;anti-encryption campaign&lt;/a&gt; has not been very successful. There are basically two reasons for this. First, people &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; communicating privately. If there’s anything we’ve learned over the past few years, it’s that the world is &lt;em&gt;not a safe place&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;for your private information&lt;/em&gt;. You don’t have to be worried about the NSA spying on you to be worried that some hacker will steal your messages or email. In fact, this kind of hack occurs so routinely that there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;popular website&lt;/a&gt; you can use to check if your accounts have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason that the government has failed to win hearts and minds is that providers like Facebook and Google and Microsoft also care very much about encryption. While some firms (*cough* Facebook and Google) do like to collect your data, even those companies are starting to realize that they hold way too much of it. This presents a  risk for them, and increasingly it’s producing a backlash from their own customers. Companies like Facebook are realizing that if they can encrypt some of that data — such that they no longer have access to it — then they can make their customers happier and safer at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have tried to navigate this impasse by asking for “exceptional access” systems. These are basically “backdoors” in cyrptographic systems that would allow providers to occasionally access user data with a warrant, but only when a specific criminal act has occurred. This is an exceptionally hard problem to get right, and many experts have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about why this is. But as hard as that problem is, it’s nothing compared to what EARN IT is asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is EARN IT, and how is it an attack on encryption?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Department of Justice has largely failed in its mission to convince the public that tech firms should stop using end-to-end encryption, it’s decided to try a different tack. Instead of demanding that tech firms provide access to messages &lt;em&gt;only in serious criminal circumstances and with a warrant,&lt;/em&gt; the DoJ and backers in Congress have decided to leverage concern around the distribution of child pornography, also known as child sexual abuse material, or CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be a bit more blunt about this than I usually would be, but only because I think the following statement is accurate. The real goal here is to make it financially impossible for providers to deploy encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me be clear: the existence of CSAM is despicable, and represents a real problem for many providers. To address it, many file sharing and messaging services voluntarily perform scanning for these types of media. This involves checking images and videos against a database of known “photo hashes” and sending a report to an organization called NCMEC when one is found. NCMEC then passes these reports on to local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end encryption systems make CSAM scanning more challenging: this is because photo scanning systems are essentially a form of mass surveillance — one that’s deployed for a good cause — and end-to-end encryption is explicitly designed to prevent mass surveillance. So photo scanning while also allowing encryption is a fundamentally hard problem, one that providers &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2019/12/08/on-client-side-media-scanning/&quot;&gt;don’t yet know how to solve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this brings us to EARN IT. The new bill, out of Lindsey Graham’s Judiciary committee, is designed to force providers to either solve the encryption-while-scanning problem, or stop using encryption entirely. And given that we don’t yet know how to solve the problem — and the techniques to do it are basically at the &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt; stage of R&amp;amp;D —  it’s likely that “stop using encryption” is really the preferred goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EARN IT works by revoking a type of liability called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230&quot;&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt; that makes it possible for providers to operate on the Internet, by preventing the provider for being held responsible for what their customers do on a platform like Facebook. The new bill would make it financially impossible for providers like WhatsApp and Apple to operate services unless they conduct “best practices” for scanning their systems for CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are no “best practices” in existence, and the techniques for doing this while preserving privacy are completely unknown, the bill creates a government-appointed committee that will tell technology providers what technology they have to use. The specific nature of the committee is byzantine and described within the bill itself. Needless to say, the makeup of the committee, which can include as few as zero data security experts, ensures that end-to-end encryption will almost certainly not be considered a best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in short: this bill is a backdoor way to allow the government to ban encryption on commercial services. And even more beautifully: it doesn’t come out and actually &lt;em&gt;ban&lt;/em&gt; the use of encryption, it just makes encryption commercially infeasible for major providers to deploy, ensuring that they’ll go bankrupt if they try to disobey this committee’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of bill you’d come up with if you knew the thing you wanted to do was unconstitutional and highly unpopular, and you basically didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So why is EARN IT a terrible idea?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we’re shockingly bad at keeping computer systems secure. This has expensive, trillion dollar costs to our economy, More than that, our failure to manage the security of data has intangible costs for our ability to function as a working society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of promising technologies that could solve this problem. End-to-end encryption happens to be one of those. It is, in fact, &lt;em&gt;the single most promising&lt;/em&gt; technology that we have to prevent hacking, loss of data, and all of the harm that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2015/07/02/technology/revenge-porn-hacker-charlie-evens/index.html&quot;&gt;befall vulnerable people because of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the technology for securing our infrastructure isn’t mature enough that we can appoint a government-appointed committee to dictate what sorts of tech it’s “ok” for  firms to provide. Maybe some day we’ll be there, but we’re years from the point where we can protect your data and also have Washington DC deciding what technology we can use to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that yes, some technologies, like CSAM scanning, will have to be re-imagined and in some cases their effectiveness will be reduced. But tech firms have been aggressive about developing this technology on their own (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/using-ai-help-organizations-detect-and-report-child-sexual-abuse-material-online/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some of the advanced work Google has been doing using Machine Learning), and they will continue to do so. The tech industry has many problems, in many areas. But it doesn’t need Senators to tell it how to do this specific job, because people in California have kids too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you support the goals of EARN IT, remember: if the U.S. Senate &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; decide to tell Silicon Valley how to do their job — at the point of a liability gun — you can bet the industry will revert to doing the &lt;em&gt;minimum possible.&lt;/em&gt; Why would the tech firms continue to invest in developing more sophisticated and expensive technology in this area, knowing that they could be mandated to deploy any new technology they invent, regardless of the cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that will be the real outcome of this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On cynicism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years there has been a vigorous debate about the value of end-to-end encryption, and the demand for law enforcement to have access to more user data. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf&quot;&gt;participated in this debate,&lt;/a&gt; and while I’ve disagreed with many on the other side of it, I’ve always fundamentally &lt;em&gt;respected&lt;/em&gt; their position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EARN IT turns all of this on its head. It’s extremely difficult to believe that this bill stems from an honest consideration of the rights of child victims, and that this legislation is anything other than a direct attack on the use of end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that the Internet community and civil society will treat this proposal with the seriousness it deserves, and that we’ll see Senators rally behind a bill that actually protects children from abuse, rather than using those issues as a cynical attempt to bring about a “backdoor ban” on encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
