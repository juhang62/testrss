<title>Facebook Referred to Kids as Young as Five as “Whales” for Its Monetized Games</title>

<description>&lt;header class=&quot;header-standard&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;details&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;p itemprop=&quot;summary&quot; class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;Facebook wouldn't refund large purchases made by underage gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've heard this story before: kid wants to buy something in the mobile game they're playing, asks their parents for their credit card info, then accidentally racks up a bunch of charges. It turns out the same thing happened on Facebook, newly unsealed court documents reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Facebook fought a class-action lawsuit which claimed the social media company profited from children who accidentally racked up huge credit card charges. The lead plaintiff was playing a game on Facebook when they asked to borrow their mother's credit card to make a $20 in-game purchase. According to lawyers, the child continued to make charges to the same card for weeks without realizing it. They believed they were making the purchases &quot;with virtual currency[.]&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/blog/a-judge-unsealed-a-trove-of-internal-facebook-documents-following-our-legal-action/&quot;&gt;The Reveal&lt;/a&gt; was recently able to unseal internal Facebook documents regarding refunds for games. According to the documents, Facebook conducted an analysis of users playing Facebook games after employees began expressing concern. The results found the average age of Angry Birds players on Facebook was five years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/uWk1Is4cEBc?wmode=opaque&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal Facebook memo discovered that while parents are aware of their children playing games on Facebook, many don't believe their child would be able to purchase anything without authorization. This is how purchases on Apple iOS work as buyers must re-authorize every purchase with their password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reveal reports that in one of the unsealed documents, two Facebook employees are recorded discussing whether or not to refund a child—whom they refer to as a &quot;whale&quot;—who racked up $6,545 in charges from a Facebook game. &quot;Is the user writing in [as] a parent, or is this user a 13ish year old,&quot; asks one employee recorded as Michael. The other Facebook employee named Gillian responds, &quot;It's a 12ish yr[sic] old. Says [it's] 15. Looks a big younger. She* not its. Lol.&quot; Michael then replies, &quot;...I wouldn't refund.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class-action lawsuit against Facebook was settled confidentially in 2016, but the judge who unsealed the documents notes the information will &quot;be of great public interest, particularly since it relates specifically to Facebook's transactions with minors.&quot; This comes at a time where Facebook is facing a new level of scrutiny after the company is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usgamer.net/articles/psa-massive-facebook-breach-stole-login-info-of-50-million-accounts&quot;&gt;was accused of using personal data inappropriately&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although gaming is just one part of Facebook, information from the documents should shed light on how Facebook interacts with its users and treats the customers that entrust it with personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Germany, France, Britain to Launch Mechanism for Trade with Iran</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-sanctions-eu/germany-france-britain-to-launch-mechanism-for-trade-with-iran-idUSKCN1PP0K3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-sanctions-eu/germany-france-britain-to-launch-mechanism-for-trade-with-iran-idUSKCN1PP0K3</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France, Germany and Britain have set up a mechanism for non-dollar trade with Iran to avert U.S. sanctions, although diplomats acknowledge it is unlikely to free up the big transactions that Tehran says it needs to keep a nuclear deal afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20190131&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1351754833&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEF0U0LE&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaks during his visit to the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, south of Tehran, Iran, January 30, 2019. Official President website/Handout via REUTERS&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaks during his visit to the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, south of Tehran, Iran, January 30, 2019. Official President website/Handout via REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington’s major European allies opposed last year’s decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to abandon the 2015 deal, under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal unless the European powers enable it to receive economic benefits. The Europeans have promised to help companies do business with Iran as long as it abides by the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington says that, although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile program or curb its regional meddling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New U.S. sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to abandon plans to invest in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European trade vehicle was conceived as a way to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods. However, those ambitions have been toned down, with diplomats saying that, realistically, it will be used only for smaller trade, for example of humanitarian products or food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It won’t change things dramatically, but it’s an important political message to Iran to show that we are determined to save the JCPOA (Iran deal) and also to the United States to show we defend our interests despite their extraterritorial sanctions,” one European diplomat said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has spent months preparing the system and it will take several months more to become operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RELATIONS WORSENING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, is registered in France and will be headed by German banker Per Fischer, a former Commerzbank director. The three European powers are shareholders and hope other states will join later, although a senior German official said this was not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the mechanism was a good first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European powers must now establish a budget for INSTEX and define its rules. Iran must also set up a mirror company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that Iran should set up the same system inside Iran to organize rial transactions for Iranian companies,” Araqchi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Embassy in Germany said it did not expect INSTEX to blunt its effort to pile economic pressure on Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as European powers and the European Union have worked to preserve the nuclear deal, relations with Tehran have been worsening. The EU this month imposed its first sanctions on Iran since the nuclear pact, in response to the ballistic missile tests and assassination plots on European soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a symbolic move, the EU added two Iranian individuals and an Iranian intelligence unit to its terrorist list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three big European powers are also assessing whether to push for new sanctions on Iran over its missile program, diplomats have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters at an ministerial meeting in Bucharest that European countries shared some of Washington’s concerns, but that abandoning the nuclear deal would not help address them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook shares shoot up after strong Q4 earnings despite data breach</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/facebook-earnings-q4-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/facebook-earnings-q4-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; managed to beat Wall Street’s estimates in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Results/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Q4 earnings&lt;/a&gt; amidst a constant beatdown in the press. Facebook hit 2.32 billion monthly users, up 2.2 percent from 2.27 billion last quarter, speeding up its growth rate. Facebook climbed to 1.52 billion daily active users from 1.49 billion last quarter for a 2 percent growth rate that dwarfed last quarter’s 1.36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook earned $16.91 billion off all those users with a $2.38 GAAP earnings per share. Those numbers handily beat Wall Street’s expectations of $16.39 billion in revenue and $2.18 GAAP earnings per share, plus 2.32 billion monthly and 1.51 billion daily active users. Facebook’s daily to monthly user ratio, or stickiness, held firm at 66 percent where it’s stayed for years, showing those still on Facebook aren’t using it much less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1776777&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;442&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?resize=768,500 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-DAU.png?resize=50,33 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook shares had closed today at $150.42 but shot up over 11 percent following the record revenue and profit announcements to hover around $167. A big 30 percent year-over-year boost in average revenue per user in North America fueled those gains. Yet that’s still down from $186 where it was a year ago and a peak of $217 in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg went beyond his usual intro to the earnings report where he assures investors things are going well and highlights new opportunities. This quarter he noted “We’ve fundamentally changed how we run our company to focus on the biggest social issues, and we’re investing more to build new and inspiring ways for people to connect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Squeezing Money From The Olds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook managed to grow its DAU in both the critical US &amp;amp; Canada and Europe markets where it earns the most money after stagnation or shrinkage in previous quarters. The fact that Facebook is no longer dwindling it its most lucrative markets is surely contributing to its share price climb. Facebook’s monthly active user plateaued in North America but roared up in Europe. That was shored up by a reversal of last quarter’s decline in Rest Of World average revenue per user, which fell 4.7% in Q3 but bounced back with 16.5 percent growth in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-1776786&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;440&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png 1678w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Earnings-Q4-2018-MAU.png?resize=50,32 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook raked in $6.8 billion in profit this quarter as it slowed down hiring and only grew headcount 5 percent from 33,606 to 35,587. It seems Facebook has gotten to a comfortable place with its security staff-up in the wake of election interference, fake news, and content moderation troubles. Its revenue is up 30 percent year-over-year while profits grew 61 percent, which is pretty remarkable for a 15-year old technology company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s plan to concentrate on product innovation in 2019 after focusing on security in 2018 was the core of today’s earnings call. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/instagram-stories-500-million/&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg laid out a product roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for more ephemerality and encryption, how unifying the infrastructure of Facebook’s messaging apps will better connect Marketplace to WhatsApp, Groups will become an organizing function for more of the Facebook experience, and shopping features will crop up across the family of apps. You can read Zuckerberg’s full opening statement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/4/posts/10106340834478671/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New stats included 500 million daily Instagram Stories users and 2 million advertisers on Stories. Zuckerberg said he was pleasantly surprised by Facebook Portal sales but didn’t give specifics. He revealed 2.7 billion people now use Facebook’s family of apps each month. However, CFO David Wehner warned the company would eventually stop sharing Facebook-only stats, presumably to mask the shift of younger users to its other apps. He also cautioned that due to the shift of users from feeds to Stories that Facebook has less experience monetizing, and targeting headwinds due to increased privacy scrutiny, Facebook predicts mid-single digit revenue growth rate reductions each quarter this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the quarter went well, morale isn’t quite as rosy. It’s been a brutal quarter for Facebook At least its swifter user growth rates show Facebook survived its biggest ever data breach without scaring off too many people. Meanwhile it’s continuously struggled with scandals like hiring opposition research firm Definers, and it saw its new teen app Lasso largely flop. Facebook will have to convince investors it knows how to win back the next generation, or at least keep squeezing a lot more money out of the last one like it did in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Statistics Done Wrong</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;The woefully complete guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.refsmmat.com&quot;&gt;Alex Reinhart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a practicing scientist, you probably use statistics to analyze your data. From basic &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; tests and standard error calculations to Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score matching, we rely on statistics to give answers to scientific problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unfortunate, because statistical errors are rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistics Done Wrong&lt;/em&gt; is a guide to the most popular statistical errors and slip-ups committed by scientists every day, in the lab and in peer-reviewed journals. Many of the errors are prevalent in vast swaths of the published literature, casting doubt on the findings of thousands of papers. &lt;em&gt;Statistics Done Wrong&lt;/em&gt; assumes no prior knowledge of statistics, so you can read it before your first statistics course or after thirty years of scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find any errors or typos, or want to suggest other popular misconceptions, &lt;a class=&quot;reference internal&quot; href=&quot;https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/introduction.html#contact&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;std std-ref&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Google’s also peddling a data collector through Apple’s back door</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;It looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; was not the only one abusing Apple’s system for distributing employee-only apps to sidestep the App Store and collect extensive data on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has been running an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7573812?hl=en&amp;amp;amp;ref_topic=7574346&quot;&gt;Screenwise Meter&lt;/a&gt;, which bears a strong resemblance to the app distributed by Facebook Research that has now been barred by Apple, TechCrunch has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its app, Google invites users aged 18 and up (or 13 if part of a family group) to download the app by way of a special code and registration process using an Enterprise Certificate. That’s the same type of policy violation that led Apple to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/&quot;&gt;shut down Facebook’s similar Research VPN iOS app&lt;/a&gt;, which had the knock-on effect of also disabling usage of Facebook’s legitimate employee-only apps — which run on the same Facebook Enterprise Certificate — and making Facebook look very iffy in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1776676&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout wp-image-1776676 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;511&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=50,25 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Google’s Screenwise Meter app for iPhones (Images: Google)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we asked Google whether its app violated Apple policy, Google announced it will remove Screenwise Meter from Apple’s Enterprise Certificate program and disable it on iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement to TechCrunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Screenwise Meter iOS app should not have operated under Apple’s developer enterprise program — this was a mistake, and we apologize. We have disabled this app on iOS devices. This app is completely voluntary and always has been. We’ve been upfront with users about the way we use their data in this app, we have no access to encrypted data in apps and on devices, and users can opt out of the program at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screen(un)wise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/google-offers-to-pay-for-people-to-have-their-web-use-tracked-minutely/&quot;&gt;launched in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Screenwise lets users &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7689542?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=7648088&quot;&gt;earn gift cards&lt;/a&gt; for sideloading an Enterprise Certificate-based VPN app that allows Google to monitor and analyze their traffic and data. Google has rebranded the program as part of the Cross Media Panel and &lt;a href=&quot;https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/audience-measurement/&quot;&gt;Google Opinion Rewards programs&lt;/a&gt; that reward users for installing tracking systems on their mobile phone, PC web browser, router and TV. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7574391?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google actually sends participants a special router&lt;/a&gt; that it can monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Screenwise was open to users as young as 13, just like Facebook’s Research app that’s now been shut down on iOS but remains on Android. Now, according to the site’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7566134?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=7563962&quot;&gt;Panelist Eligibility&lt;/a&gt; rules, Google requires the primary users of its Opinion Rewards to be 18 or older, but still allows secondary panelists as young as 13 in the same household to join the program and have their devices tracked, as demonstrated in this video below (which was created in August of last year, underscoring that the program is still active).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uikWgn5MswY?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Facebook, Google is much more upfront about how its research data collection programs work, what’s collected and that it’s directly involved. It also gives users the option of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7568157?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=7648088&quot;&gt;guest mode&lt;/a&gt;” for when they don’t want traffic monitored, or someone younger than 13 is using the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the not-insignificant issues of privacy aside — in short, many people lured by financial rewards may not fully take in what it means to have a company fully monitoring all your screen-based activity — and the implications of what extent tech businesses are willing to go to to amass more data about users to get an edge on competitors, Google Screenwise Meter for iOS appears to violate Apple’s policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This states, in essence, that the Enterprise Certificate program for distributing apps without the App Store or Apple’s oversight is only for internal employee-only apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google walks users through how to install the Enterprise Certificate and VPN on their phone. Developers seeking to do external testing on iOS are supposed to use the TestFlight system that sees apps reviewed and limits their distribution to 10,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve yet to hear back from Apple, but Google moving quickly to cancel its iOS Screenwise Meter might save it from further punishment. We’ll see if Apple still invalidates the certifications for all of Google’s legitimate employee-only apps that run using the same certificate the way it did to Facebook. That would throw a wrench into Google’s product development and daily work flow that could be more damaging than just removing one way it gathers competitive intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than taking seven hours to respond as backlash swelled like Facebook, Google managed to get things sorted in a little under three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve updated this post throughout in response to Google’s statement that it will shut down the iOS version of Screenwise Meter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Use DuckDuckGo to improve your privacy online (2018)</title>
<link>https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-simplified/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-simplified/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;DuckDuckGo moves beyond search to also protect you while browsing.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, DuckDuckGo has offered millions of people a private alternative to Google, serving over &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html&quot;&gt;16 billion anonymous searches&lt;/a&gt;. Today we're excited to launch fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, extending DuckDuckGo's protection beyond the search box to wherever the Internet takes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to use the Internet without it feeling a bit creepy – like there’s a nosey neighbor watching everything you do from across the street. Except, instead of a nosey neighbor, it’s a vast array of highly sophisticated tracker networks, run by big companies like Google and Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity&quot;&gt;recording everything you do online&lt;/a&gt;, often without your knowledge, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16405974/facebook-russian-election-ads-10-million-viewers&quot;&gt;selling their findings&lt;/a&gt; to the highest bidder via targeted ads. While closing the blinds at home can put a stop to your neighbors, there isn’t something that simple that can work online. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re taking a major step to simplify online privacy with the launch of fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, now with built-in tracker network blocking, smarter encryption, and, of course, private search – all designed to operate seamlessly together while you search and browse the web. Our updated app and extension are now available across all major platforms – &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.duckduckgo.safari-HKE973VLUW&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-for-chrome/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id663592361?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; – so that you can easily get all the privacy essentials you need on any device with just one download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app will also now show you a Privacy Grade rating (A-F) when you visit a website. This rating lets you see at a glance how protected you are, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying website's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2018/01/creepy-site_devices-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the DuckDuckGo app and extension showing how a site's privacy has been improved.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, cobbling together an effective privacy solution has required researching complicated technologies, installing multiple add-ons and apps on each device, and often worsening your Internet experience. Others have been unfortunately misled by supposed simple solutions. Think “Incognito” mode blocks Google from watching what you’re doing? Think again. Private browsing modes are marketed to make you think that if it's not in your device’s browser history, it never happened. Sadly, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/is-private-browsing-really-private/&quot;&gt;couldn't be further from the truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new DuckDuckGo browser extension or mobile app, you are now able to seamlessly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking&quot;&gt;Expose and Block Tracker Networks Watching You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of websites across the Internet &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/followed-by-ads/&quot;&gt;contain hidden tracker networks&lt;/a&gt;, with Google trackers now lurking behind 76% of pages, Facebook’s trackers on 24% of pages, and countless others soaking up your personal information to follow you with ads around the Web, or worse. Our Privacy Protection will block all the hidden trackers we can find, exposing the major advertising networks tracking you over time, so that you can track who's trying to track you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2018/01/creepy-site_iphone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the DuckDuckGo app showing how many trackers have been blocked.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;https&quot;&gt;Increase Encryption Protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not all sites offer an encrypted version, thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads&quot;&gt;this has been rapidly changing&lt;/a&gt;. If we discover a site offers an encrypted version but does not send you to it automatically, DuckDuckGo will. This encryption protects you from eavesdroppers, like ISPs, grabbing up your personal information as it travels across the Internet between you and the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tosdr&quot;&gt;Decode a Website’s Privacy Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most privacy policies are difficult to understand, and aren’t reviewed closely enough. Even if we block all the tracker networks we find, and even if we upgrade encryption, a website could still be using your data for nefarious purposes, such as selling it to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tosdr.org/&quot;&gt;Terms of Service Didn't Read&lt;/a&gt; (TOSDR) to include their scores of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available. However, because most privacy policies still remain unstudied, we’re working with TOSDR to help them to rate and label as many websites as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search Privately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our app and extension also include DuckDuckGo private search! You share your most personal information with your search engine, like your financial, medical, and political questions. What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn’t track you. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you start using the new app and browser extension, you’ll quickly notice something: hardly any website currently gets an &quot;A&quot; on privacy. That’s because hardly any website out there truly prioritizes your privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these widespread poor privacy practices, too many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet. We disagree, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of trust online. We want privacy to be the default, not the exception, and this launch is a major step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last decade, DuckDuckGo has been giving you the ability to search privately, but that privacy was only limited to our search box. Now, when you also use the DuckDuckGo browser extension or mobile app, we will provide you with seamless privacy protection on the websites you visit. Our goal is to expand this privacy protection over time by adding even more privacy features into this single package. While not all privacy protection can be as seamless, the essentials available today and those that we will be adding will go a long way to protecting your privacy online, without compromising your Internet experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more people start taking their privacy back online, the companies who make money off our personal information will be put on more notice and we’ll collectively raise the Internet’s privacy grade, ending the widespread use of invasive tracking. True to the collective nature of this effort, we’re also building our extension and app in the open with all of the code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duckduckgo/&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so we invite you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/app&quot;&gt;Install DuckDuckGo on any device to take back your privacy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more privacy advice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/duckduckgo&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; get our &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter&quot;&gt;privacy crash course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Foxconn Is Reconsidering Plan for Manufacturing in Wisconsin</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/foxconn-wisconsin-manufacturing.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/foxconn-wisconsin-manufacturing.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was heralded a year and a half ago as the start of a Midwestern manufacturing renaissance: Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics behemoth, would build a $10 billion Wisconsin plant to make flat-screen televisions, creating 13,000 jobs. President Trump later called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/trump-wisconsin-foxconn-harley.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the project&lt;/a&gt; “the eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now that prospect looks less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Pointing to “new realities” in the market, the company said Wednesday that it was reassessing the plans, underscoring the difficult economics of manufacturing in the United States. “The global market environment that existed when the project was first announced has changed,” Foxconn said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Company officials had signaled for months that their emphasis was increasingly on research and development rather than large-scale production, dampening the potential for blue-collar job creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That turn runs counter to Mr. Trump’s vision for the project, which he had cited as a milestone in reversing the decline in factory jobs. The twist also brought new friction in Wisconsin, where the initiative has been politically fraught from the start because of its billions of dollars in tax subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Foxconn said that it remained committed to creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and that it was “moving forward with plans to build an advanced manufacturing facility.” But it did not address the share of jobs to be devoted to production, and economists questioned how such a large work force could be created if the plant’s focus was on other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Foxconn statement followed a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-wisconsin-exclusive/exclusive-foxconn-reconsidering-plans-to-make-lcd-panels-at-wisconsin-plant-idUSKCN1PO0FV&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reuters report&lt;/a&gt; that Louis Woo, a special assistant to the company’s chairman, Terry Gou, had said the costs of manufacturing screens for televisions and other consumer products were too high in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“In terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S.,” Mr. Woo told Reuters. “We can’t compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to revitalize American manufacturing was considered an important factor in his capturing Wisconsin and other battleground states in 2016. Yet the cost of luring Foxconn set off a partisan battle in Wisconsin that extended into the midterm elections last year, when Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Walker and state lawmakers had agreed to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/trump-wisconsin-foxconn-harley.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;more than $4 billion in tax credits&lt;/a&gt; and other inducements over a 15-year period, an unusually high figure, for a plant in Mount Pleasant, near Racine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Wisconsin residents have had mixed feelings about the investment, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.biztimes.com/2018/industries/construction/foxconn-sentiment-remains-unchanged-among-wisconsin-residents/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polls show&lt;/a&gt;. And early on, economists questioned whether the large-scale manufacturing plant and the thousands of jobs would come to fruition. The increasing focus on research raised new doubts about the scale of hiring — economists said that strategy could produce a smaller number of higher-paying jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There aren’t that many R&amp;amp;D facilities in the world with 13,000 people,” said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the fall campaign, Wisconsin Democrats held up the Foxconn pursuit as evidence that Republicans were focused on businesses, not ordinary people — and too willing to hand out state funds to a single company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Defending their eight years in power, Republicans countered that the plant would re-establish Wisconsin’s strength as a manufacturing hub, and residents in the southeastern part of the state, closest to the plant, were especially receptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Trump, Gov. Scott Walker and Foxconn’s chairman, Terry Gou, right, at the groundbreaking. Mr. Trump hailed the project as an example of his efforts to attract foreign investment to create manufacturing jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evan Vucci/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, reports of Foxconn’s reassessment set off a new round in that political fight. Republicans who control Wisconsin’s Legislature suggested that the arrival of Gov. Tony Evers, the Democrat who ousted Mr. Walker, was partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration,” said a statement from the Assembly’s speaker, Robin Vos, and the Senate’s majority leader, Scott Fitzgerald. “Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Evers, who took office this month, has indicated that he would not block the Foxconn project, although he and other Democrats called it regrettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This deal was reckless from the beginning,” said Martha Laning, the state’s Democratic chairwoman. “Despite multiple red flags throughout the negotiation process, Wisconsin Republicans put taxpayers on the line for $4.5 billion and rewrote the entire rule book for an election-year talking point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plans for the plant — including what it would produce, and the composition of its work force — have changed over time. Tim Sheehy, president of greater Milwaukee’s chamber of commerce, said Foxconn had initially believed that 70 percent of its hires would be for “plant floor” jobs and 30 percent in design and engineering. Now, he said, those proportions have flipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Foxconn’s agreement with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation “does protect the state to some extent if Foxconn falls short of promised job creation,” said Timothy Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich. “But the capital investment tax credit, in particular, does not seem to fully adjust for this if Foxconn ends up doing a much less job-intensive and more capital-intensive project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At this point, the cost to taxpayers across the state is likely minimal. The company has said it will forfeit tax credits for 2018 because it fell short of the hiring target on which they were based. The company did receive a sales-tax exemption on some purchases of material, Mr. Bartik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County have borne most of the preliminary costs. According to Michael Farren, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia, Mount Pleasant had acquired 85 percent of the initial 1,200 acres intended for the factory through eminent domain, and turned over at least 65 percent of the land to Foxconn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Local officials pointed out that Foxconn had already invested $200 million in Wisconsin and built a 120,000-square-foot structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But others noted that the company had failed to follow through on grand proposals in the past. It announced in 2013 that it would invest $30 million in a high-tech factory in Pennsylvania that would create 500 jobs. The factory never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company laid out &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/business/foxconn-trump-wisconsin.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;ambitious plans in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, too — for 100,000 jobs. That project was mostly left on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Foxconn has a history of not delivering on its jobs and manufacturing commitments that it’s made,” said Megan Randall, a research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington. “These types of instances are exactly why accountability measures are so important in state and local tax-incentive deals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Bartik said Foxconn’s rationale about changing global conditions was puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It is hard for me to see how global conditions have dramatically changed the competitive position of the U.S.’s labor costs in producing flat-screen TVs from when the project was announced in 2017,” he said. Wage growth has accelerated as the labor market has tightened in the past year and a half, but increases have been modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It could mean that “this project will end up mostly being a R&amp;amp;D operation in Madison, with a much smaller factory in southeast Wisconsin,” Mr. Bartik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
