<title>Protections Against Fingerprinting and Crypto Mining in Firefox Nightly and Beta</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/04/09/protections-against-fingerprinting-and-cryptocurrency-mining-available-in-firefox-nightly-and-beta/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/04/09/protections-against-fingerprinting-and-cryptocurrency-mining-available-in-firefox-nightly-and-beta/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we have been working hard to protect you from threats and annoyances on the web, so you can live your online life with less to worry about. Last year, we told you about adapting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/&quot;&gt;approach to anti-tracking&lt;/a&gt; given the added importance of keeping people’s information on the web private in today’s climate. We talked about blocking tracking while also offering a clear set of controls to give our users more choice over what information they share with sites. One of the three key initiatives we listed was mitigating harmful practices like fingerprinting and cryptomining. We have added a feature to block fingerprinting and cryptomining in Firefox Nightly as an option for users to turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are fingerprinting and cryptomining scripts?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of popular “fingerprinting” scripts are invisibly embedded on many web pages, harvesting a snapshot of your computer’s configuration to build a digital fingerprint that can be used to track you across the web, even if you clear your cookies. Fingerprinting violates Firefox’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anti_tracking_policy#2._Tracking_via_unintended_identification_techniques&quot;&gt;anti-tracking policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another category of scripts called “cryptominers” run costly operations on your web browser without your knowledge or consent, using the power of your computer’s CPU to generate cryptocurrency for someone else’s benefit. These scripts slow down your computer, drain your battery and rack up your electric bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How will Firefox block these harmful scripts?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat these threats, we are pleased to announce new protections against fingerprinters and cryptominers. In collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://disconnect.me/&quot;&gt;Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;, we have compiled lists of domains that serve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-prod-lists/blob/7eaadac98bc9dcc95ce917eff7bbb21cb71484ec/disconnect-blacklist.json#L9316&quot;&gt;fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-prod-lists/blob/7eaadac98bc9dcc95ce917eff7bbb21cb71484ec/disconnect-blacklist.json#L9537&quot;&gt;cryptomining&lt;/a&gt; scripts. Now in the latest Firefox Nightly and Beta versions, we give users the option to block both kinds of scripts as part of our Content Blocking suite of protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox Nightly 68 and Beta 67, these new protections against fingerprinting and cryptomining are currently disabled by default. You can enable them with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click the Firefox main menu: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/hamburger.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2622&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/hamburger.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;68&quot; height=&quot;64&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose “Preferences”: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/prefs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2623 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/prefs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;52&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the “Privacy and Security” tab at left: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/privsec.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2624 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/privsec-300x66.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;66&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/files/2019/04/privsec-300x66.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/files/2019/04/privsec.png 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under “Content Blocking”, click on “Custom”: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/custom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2625&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/custom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;212&quot; height=&quot;76&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, check “Cryptominers” and “Fingerprinters” so that they are both blocked: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/cm_fp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2626&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/cm_fp-300x162.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/files/2019/04/cm_fp-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/files/2019/04/cm_fp.png 416w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once enabled, Firefox will block any scripts that have been identified by Disconnect to participate in cryptomining or fingerprinting. (These protections will be turned on by default in Nightly in the coming weeks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing these protections by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, we will start testing these protections with small groups of users and will continue to work with Disconnect to improve and expand the set of domains blocked by Firefox. We plan to enable these protections by default for all Firefox users in a future release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome your reports of any broken websites you may encounter. Just click on the Tracking Protection “shield” in the address bar and click “Report a Problem”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2621&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/2019-04-04-12.20.31.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-2621 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/futurereleases/files/2019/04/2019-04-04-12.20.31.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;794&quot; height=&quot;1022&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Help us by reporting broken websites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to check out this feature to keep users safe on the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/&quot;&gt;Nightly and Beta releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Can it survive itself?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t’s not what celebrants want to hear when the champagne is exploding out of shaken bottles of Dom, the confetti is falling, and their stock is up 8.7 percent at the market’s close, but I have an announcement to make: San Francisco is past its prime and the fires of creation have abated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the millionaires newly minted by Lyft’s IPO, and with those set to be minted by Uber’s and Palantir’s and AirBnB’s, you might expect this enclave to become the next Babylon of American capitalism. While our moralists in the media — Nellie Bowles, Emily Chang, et al. — busily tsk-tsk the greed and the lust and the hypocrisy and the hubris, there is a story here they miss: The city’s current concentration of wealth likely doesn’t represent the beginning of a golden-if-sinful era, but the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnificent in the distance, San Francisco is now shockingly ugly up close. In the decade I have lived here, the city has achieved the seemingly impossible: It has combined the expensive and the bland and the appalling into a new form of decadence. To the untrained eye, it looks magical: a city of the future, a city of gasps. Then, slowly, it reveals itself to be a city of lies, one that dismisses the idea of city living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distant future Silicon Valley sells with the zeal of a crusader — all the lip service it pays to making the world a better place — shimmers like fool’s gold, monopolistic surveillance capitalism cloaked in the language of the common good. Billboards off the highway announce the coming of artificial intelligence as new nonprofits pop up to defend us against HAL and Skynet, but in reality “AI” is machine learning — pattern-recognition software parsing out subtle statistical connections to win board games and show you better ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a devilish consistency, this city sets you up for disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--native&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a venture-capital fund that invests as early as possible in startups, I now see fewer and fewer companies choosing to come launch here. When we opened our doors in 2015, maybe 80 percent of our investments were in Bay Area companies. Last year, half of them were, and we expect to see that number decrease even more in the years ahead. Andreessen-Horowitz, the famed Silicon Valley VC firm, has announced that it’s becoming more or less a hedge fund, presumably to focus on later-stage opportunities. Peter Thiel, who had lived here since the mid 90s, has now decamped to Los Angeles, and says there is a less than 50 percent chance the next great tech company will arise in an increasingly expensive, conformist Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Silicon Valley is now more fashion than opportunity,” Thiel told the Swiss newspaper &lt;em&gt;Zeitung&lt;/em&gt;. “The heads are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of independent thought aside, the &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; has identified the source of the problem: You can’t build a successful startup from a garage if a garage costs a million bucks. The flow of new creations is being choked off first and foremost because there are fewer cheap places for new things to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--native&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco recently hit $3690 per month, 30 percent greater than in New York City. Over the last decade, the Bay Area has added 722,000 jobs but built only 106,000 new homes. Proposition M, passed in the 1980s to avoid “Manhattanization,” limits the supply of office space. The city’s average Class A asking rent has risen 124 percent since 2010 to over $80 per square foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legendary urbanist Jane Jacobs once remarked that new ideas come from old buildings, the types of places you can alter without permission because no one cares about them. This is one reason why so many garage startups and garage bands and artists spilling paint in discarded warehouse lofts have left their mark on the world. The true creative class can’t afford to rent expensive new studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in San Francisco, the true creative class can’t afford to rent &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; space anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artists have fled. Sadie Valeri, an artist who has been painting and drawing in San Francisco for over 20 years, recently announced that she is closing her famed Potrero Hill atelier. “Our studio lease is ending,” she wrote in an email to her students last month. “And we have been informed that our rent will be increasing significantly to more than we can afford.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no longer a San Francisco music scene, either. The house the Grateful Dead lived in at 710 Ashbury Street during their formative years in the 1960s is surrounded by Victorian townhouses that today sell for $3 million and more. A tourist review of the location puts it well: “Unless you knew who lived there, you wouldn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can stomach all that blandness, I wish you luck with the appalling. Up and down the city’s disorienting hills, you notice homeless men and women — junkies, winos, the dispossessed — passed out in the vestibules of empty storefronts on otherwise busy streets. Encampments of tents sprout in every shadowy corner: under highway overpasses, down alleys. Streets are peppered with used syringes. Strolling the sidewalks, you smell the faint malodorous traces of human excrement and soiled clothing. Crowded thoroughfares such as Market Street, even in the light of midday, stage a carnival of indecipherable outbursts and drug-induced thrashings about which the police seem to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confused mumble, the incoherent finger-pointing tirade, the twitch, the cold daemonic stare, the drunken stumble and drool — these are the rhythms of a city on the edge of a schizophrenic explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of this blight is codified nostalgia and greed. (Nellie Bowles where are you?) Baby Boomer civil servants act as urban taxidermists stuffing and mounting a dead city so it always resembles the past. The &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; tells us that there is indeed a mayor, and maybe even a chief of police, but it is not known who is actually in charge. Housing and zoning committees obscure responsibility for governance. But somewhere in the bureaucratic hierarchy faceless city functionaries administer labyrinthine regulations that benefit the rich over the poor, the old over the young, the here over those to come, the past over the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the more comical examples of this sclerosis, a real-estate developer worked for five years and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to show that a proposed housing development wouldn’t cast shadows on a nearby playground or destroy the historic character of the laundromat it sat atop. In another, it took two years for a woman to open an ice-cream shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the days pass in a foggy calm. Coit Tower, the Painted Ladies, both bridges, and Alcatraz all stand serene. It is not a city of urgency and restless insomnia, not a city of any discernable power. It never roars like New York or snaps cold like Chicago. It is a pastel city that optimizes its sleep with a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not holding my breath for a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco has been overwhelmingly Democratic since the 1950s. The last Republican mayor won an election in 1956. It is a one-party city touting a civic philosophy with its back to the wall. From afar city Democrats pay lip service to helping the poor. But up close the facts tell a different story. None of their policies in the last half-century have done much to rescue the poor from poverty. Inflexible limits on the housing supply push marginalized groups even further to the margins. The stratospheric cost of housing has flung minority families to the outer edges of the Bay Area, reinforcing segregation. A UC Berkeley study found that a 30 percent increase in the median rent led to a 28 percent decrease in the number of minority households in a neighborhood. Whole neighborhoods from the city have decamped to the hinterlands of Antioch and Vallejo. Stories of three-hour commutes from Stockton have become more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the media seems to have never taken an economics class, much less read Paul Krugman. It is quite simply baffling. Housing restrictions have made the situation worse and worse for decades. No one seems to notice that the same debates play out time and again to no positive end. Instead, for commentary, reporters invariably trot out someone who disguises greed with the piety of a San Franciscan born and raised. Ah, those picturesque locals! Whatever sad story they tell, they shamelessly aim to limit the housing supply, inflating the prices of their own properties. Meanwhile, the media prints their moralistic scolding of the gentrifiers, i.e. anyone with an urge to build affordable housing. No one seems to care about the unseen: the people who never get to live here because the apartments they would live in aren’t ever built, the bookstores unopened, the dance steps untried, the poetry never recited because the rent’s too damn high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities are nearly immortal; though they decline, they rarely die. But creative clusters can and do bite the dust. They are fragile, fleeting things. Rome survived the fall of a civilization and two world wars; Ancient Athens and Quattrocento Florence dazzled and faded. Now, San Francisco has passed its prime and settled into a sad late-middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad-unit--inline__label&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cities that become dominated by a single industry, cities that reward generation of wealth and financial success over a sense of shared humanity and community have a hard time preserving social capital,” Sam Altman, the president of YCombinator, told the economist Tyler Cowen in a recent interview. “Where I grew up, no one would walk past a person collapsed on the side of the street on their way to work and not do something about it. I hope I never get used to the fact that that happens in San Francisco.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True revolution would involve curbing the authority of the San Francisco Planning Commission. If Democrats in the city or in Sacramento actually cared about the poor or the environment (density is green), they would enact a land-value tax and establish a redistributive policy to align the interests of the city, current residents, and future citizens. Strong government housing policy could spur growth and redistribute the city’s wealth fairly. But most of all, the freedom to build and experiment is the engine of Silicon Valley dynamism. Allow the experiments of the few to become the prosperity and fulfillment of the many, and the city could thrive once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to happen anytime soon, of course. But If the dream is lost, the skills and funding remain . . . for now. I’m advising all the startups I meet with to consider staying in other cities. And anyone else who comes here should be aware that most bathrooms require a code to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;Just in time for Tax Day, the for-profit tax preparation industry is about to realize one of its long-sought goals. Congressional Democrats and Republicans are moving to permanently bar the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee, led by Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/N000015-richard-e-neal&quot;&gt;Richard Neal, D-Mass.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ways-means-committee-passes-historic-legislation-redesign-irs&quot;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/116/hr1957&quot;&gt;Taxpayer First Act&lt;/a&gt;, a wide-ranging bill making several administrative changes to the IRS that is sponsored by Reps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/L000287-john-lewis&quot;&gt;John Lewis, D-Ga.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/K000376-mike-kelly&quot;&gt;Mike Kelly, R-Pa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;In one of its provisions, the bill makes it illegal for the IRS to create its own online system of tax filing. Companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&amp;amp;R Block have lobbied for years to block the IRS from creating such a system. If the tax agency created its own program, which would be similar to programs other developed countries have, it would threaten the industry’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.3&quot;&gt;“This could be a disaster. It could be the final nail in the coffin of the idea of the IRS ever being able to create its own program,” said Mandi Matlock, a tax attorney who does work for the National Consumer Law Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;Experts have long argued that the IRS has failed to make filing taxes as easy and cheap as it could be. In addition to a free system of online tax preparation and filing, the agency could provide people with pre-filled tax forms containing the salary data the agency already has, as ProPublica first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;The Free File Alliance, a private industry group, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://freefilealliance.org/&quot;&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of American taxpayers are eligible to file for free. Those taxpayers, who must make less than $66,000, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/&quot;&gt;access&lt;/a&gt; to free tax software provided by the companies. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-file-your-taxes-for-free-online-if-you-make-less-than-66000-a-year-2018-03-28&quot;&gt;just 3%&lt;/a&gt; of eligible U.S. taxpayers actually use the free program each year. Critics of the program &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/395762-free-file-providers-scam-taxpayers-congress-cant-be-fooled&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that companies use it as a cross-marketing tool to upsell paid products, that they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/free-file-online-tax-preparation-fees-intuit-turbotax-h-r-block&quot;&gt;deliberately underpromoted&lt;/a&gt; the free option and that it leaves consumer data open to privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;The congressional move would codify the status quo. Under an existing memorandum of understanding with the industry group, the IRS pledges not to create its own online filing system and, in exchange, the companies offer their free filing services to those below the income threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;One member of the Free File Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/free-file-online-tax-preparation-fees-intuit-turbotax-h-r-block&quot;&gt;explicitly told&lt;/a&gt; shareholders that the IRS “developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation … may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;The IRS’ deal with the Free File Alliance is regularly renegotiated and there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/free-file-online-tax-preparation-fees-intuit-turbotax-h-r-block&quot;&gt;repeated&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/republicans-and-dems-come-together-to-keep-irs-from-competing-turbotax&quot;&gt;bipartisan&lt;/a&gt; efforts in Congress to put the deal into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;Those efforts have been fueled by hefty lobbying spending and campaign contributions by the industry. Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block last year poured a combined $6.6 million into lobbying related to the IRS filing deal and other issues. Neal, who became Ways and Means chair this year after Democrats took control of the House, received $16,000 in contributions from Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block in the last two election cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;Neal, who describes himself as a longtime champion of the existing Free File program, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://neal.house.gov/press-releases/neal-opening-statement-markup-retirement-tax-administration-and-reemployment-services&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that it would “would help low- and moderate-income taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;Free File Alliance Executive Director Tim Hugo called it “a great idea when you can provide a great product — free tax returns — to Americans at no cost to the federal government.” An H&amp;amp;R Block spokesperson said the company believes “Free File should be the subject of ongoing improvement, and we are committed to working with all parties to strengthen and improve Free File on behalf of the American taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;Spokespeople for Neal, Lewis and Kelly did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the provision. A companion Senate bill with the same provision has been introduced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/G000386-charles-e-grassley&quot;&gt;Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/W000779-ron-wyden&quot;&gt;Ron Wyden, D-Ore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;While efforts to make the IRS’ deal with the tax preparation industry permanent have fizzled in the past, critics are particularly worried this year. The Taxpayer First Act also includes a provision that would restrict the IRS’ use of private debt collectors to those above a certain income. A Wyden spokesperson said the current bill is a “bipartisan, bicameral compromise so it includes priorities of both chairmen and ranking members.” Wyden “supports giving the IRS the resources it needs to offer more services to taxpayers,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China says it wants to eliminate Bitcoin mining</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cryptocurrency/china-says-it-wants-to-eliminate-bitcoin-mining-idUSKCN1RL0C4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cryptocurrency/china-says-it-wants-to-eliminate-bitcoin-mining-idUSKCN1RL0C4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s state planner wants to eliminate bitcoin mining in the country, according to a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop in a sign of growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory grey area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to more than 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday the draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NDRC’s move is in line overall with China’s desire to control different layers of the rapidly growing crypto industry, and does not yet signal a major shift in policy,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment firm Kenetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe China simply wants to ‘reboot’ the crypto industry into one that they have oversight on, the same approach they took with the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bitcoin traders said they were not surprised by the government’s move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin mining wastes a lot of electricity,” said one Chinese bitcoin trader who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CRACKDOWN CONTINUES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted they were puzzled by the surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, which accounts for around half of the cryptocurrency market, was down by around 1.4 percent on Tuesday, while other major coins such as Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP also fell by similar amounts. Traders in London said it was unclear how much the Chinese move was weighing on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners that team up for economies of scale - are located in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Half of the network is probably located in China,” said Alex de Vries, a consultant with PwC in Amsterdam who specializes on blockchain and researches cryptocurrency mining. He added that the number of mining facilities in the world is still limited to several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries with relatively cheap electricity have emerged as major hosts of cryptocurrency mining. Mati Greenspan, an analyst with eToro in Israel, said any ban by China would cut a key supply of cheap electricity for the industry and raise the average cost to mine bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc, have since let their applications lapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies’ business models and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitmain declined to comment on the NDRC’s proposal to ban bitcoin mining. Canaan did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Canaan’s IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for cryptocurrency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloud Run beta pricing</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</guid>
<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;special&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beta release of Cloud Run. This feature might be changed in backward-incompatible ways and is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;This page provides pricing information for Cloud Run and Cloud Run on GKE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudrun-pricing&quot;&gt;Cloud Run pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Run charges you only for the resources you use, rounded up to the nearest 100 millisecond. Note that each of these resources have free quota. Your total Cloud Run bill will be the sum of the resources in the pricing table. Note that when setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency&quot;&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; higher than one request at a time, multiple requests can share the allocated CPU and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing_table_us-central1&quot;&gt;Pricing table (us-central1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;CPU&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Memory&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Requests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Networking&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First 180,000 vCPU-seconds free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First 360,000 GB-seconds free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 million requests free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First 1 GB egress traffic free platform-wide&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0.00002400 / vCPU-seconds beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$0.00000250 / GB-second beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$0.40 / million requests beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Free during beta. At beta exit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing&quot;&gt;Compute Engine networking prices&lt;/a&gt; apply to egress beyond free tier.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/skus/&quot;&gt;Cloud Platform SKUs&lt;/a&gt; apply.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free quota resets every month; you are billed only for usage past the free quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;billable_time&quot;&gt;Billable Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given container instance, billable time occurs when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The container instance is starting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one request is being processed by the container instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are billed only for the CPU and memory allocated while a request is active on a container instance, rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a container instance receives many requests at the same time, billable time begins with the start of the first request and ends at the end of the last request, as shown in the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudrun-gke-pricing&quot;&gt;Cloud Run on GKE pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Run on GKE is an add-on for Google Kubernetes Engine. Workloads running in a cluster are included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing&quot;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine pricing&lt;/a&gt;. Final pricing for Cloud Run on GKE will be determined before GA.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft says its data shows FCC reports overstate broadband adoption</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/microsoft-says-its-data-shows-fcc-reports-massively-overstate-broadband-adoption/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The broadband divide in the U.S. is real, but if you want to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; real, don’t ask the FCC. Its yearly broadband deployment report, already under fire for &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/fcc-looking-into-reported-error-throwing-broadband-deployment-numbers-off-by-millions/&quot;&gt;serious data problems&lt;/a&gt;, has now been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/04/08/its-time-for-a-new-approach-for-mapping-broadband-data-to-better-serve-americans/&quot;&gt;further questioned by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which says its own data contradicts coverage data provided by internet providers. Despite $22 billion in government &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/02/fcc-gets-ready-to-kick-off-2-billion-rural-broadband-fund/&quot;&gt;spending&lt;/a&gt;, the company says, “adoption has barely budged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; explained that it was concerned with apparent inaccuracies in reports purporting to document broadband availability throughout the country. Leveraging data sourced from its various online services, it came to vastly different conclusions than the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have 200 services that we operate as a company,” said Microsoft President Brad Smith &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/rural-broadband/&quot;&gt;in a recent talk&lt;/a&gt;. “We can see download speeds across the country, and in every county, and we’ve assembled our own map with our own estimates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the FCC report suggests that broadband, as it is currently defined, is not currently available to around 25 million people. Sounds reasonable. But Microsoft’s data says that some 163 million people “do not use the internet at broadband speeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren’t the same thing, obviously, but you’d think if a person had broadband available they would use it at least now and then, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look further into the problem, Microsoft checked out a few locales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our home state of Washington, the FCC data indicates that 100 percent of Ferry County residents have access to broadband. When we spoke to local officials, they indicated that very few residents in this rural county had access and those that did were using broadband in business. Our data bears this out, showing that only 2 percent of Ferry County is using broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the entire county has broadband, but next to no one uses it? Seems odd. The pattern repeats elsewhere as well, rural and urban, with similar deltas between &lt;em&gt;reported&lt;/em&gt; broadband availability and &lt;em&gt;observed&lt;/em&gt; broadband activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These significant discrepancies across nearly all counties in all 50 states indicates there is a problem with the accuracy of the access data reported by the FCC,” concludes Microsoft’s chief data analytics officer, John Kahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1809486&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png 1318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=50,27 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part of the issue is that internet providers essentially just report their own coverage via a form, and the FCC reports it more or less as fact. That’s a problem not just when a mistake on a form adds tens of millions of subscribers that don’t actually exist, but when large ISPs overstate their coverage so they don’t have to pay to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s suggestions, which it has made to Members of Congress and the FCC (though it won’t, as I originally wrote here, testify in the Senate on Wednesday) would make it far more difficult to fib on the Form 477, which as written seems to provide enormous leeway for a company to imply coverage that isn’t actually there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems described here are not new or obscure, and even FCC commissioners have taken issue with the way this data is collected. Hopefully given the continued and growing outcry concerning this misleading report we will soon know better who in our country has, or needs, help getting online. That the FCC wants to help I don’t doubt, but in order to do so they need better data.&lt;/p&gt;
