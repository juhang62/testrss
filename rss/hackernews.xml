<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-info&quot;&gt;Posted by naruse on 25 Sep 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 3.0.0-preview1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces a number of new features and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RBS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is a language to describe the types of Ruby programs. Type checkers including type-profiler and other tools supporting RBS will understand Ruby programs much better with RBS definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write down the definition of classes and modules: methods defined in the class, instance variables and their types, and inheritance/mix-in relations. The goal of RBS is to support commonly seen patterns in Ruby programs and it allows writing advanced types including union types, method overloading, and generics. It also supports duck typing with &lt;em&gt;interface types&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby 3.0 ships with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rbs&lt;/code&gt; gem, which allows parsing and processing type definitions written in RBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a small example of RBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rbs&quot; data-lang=&quot;rbs&quot;&gt;module ChatApp
  VERSION: String

  class Channel
    attr_reader name: String
    attr_reader messages: Array[Message]
    attr_reader users: Array[User | Bot]              # `|` means union types, `User` or `Bot`.

    def initialize: (String) -&amp;gt; void

    def post: (String, from: User | Bot) -&amp;gt; Message   # Method overloading is supported.
            | (File, from: User | Bot) -&amp;gt; Message
  end
end&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rbs&quot;&gt;README of rbs gem&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ractor (experimental)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ractor is an Actor-model like concurrent abstraction designed to provide a parallel execution feature without thread-safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make multiple ractors and you can run them in parallel. Ractor enables to make thread-safe parallel programs because ractors can not share normal objects. Communication between ractors are supported by message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To limit sharing objects, Ractor introduces several restrictions to the Ruby’s syntax (without multiple Ractors, there is no changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification and implmentation are not matured and changed in future, so this feature is marked as experimental and show the experimental feature warning if Ractor is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following small program calculates &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prime?&lt;/code&gt; in parallel with two ractors and about x2 times faster with two or more cores than sequential program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'prime'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# n.prime? with sent integers in r1, r2 run in parallel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Ractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Ractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;recv&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;prime?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# send parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;61&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;61&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# wait for the results of expr1, expr2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/ractor.md&quot;&gt;doc/ractor.md&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduler (Experimental)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thread#scheduler&lt;/code&gt; is introduced for intercepting blocking operations. This allows for light-weight concurrency without changing existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently supported classes/methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mutex#lock&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mutex#unlock&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mutex#sleep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ConditionVariable#wait&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue#pop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SizedQueue#push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thread#join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kernel#sleep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IO#wait&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IO#read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IO#write&lt;/code&gt; and related methods (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#wait_readable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#gets&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#puts&lt;/code&gt; and so on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IO#select&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not supported&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current entry point for concurrency is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fiber.schedule{...}&lt;/code&gt; however this is subject to change by the time Ruby 3 is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is a test scheduler available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/socketry/async/pull/56&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Async::Scheduler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/scheduler.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doc/scheduler.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more details. [Feature #16786]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAUTION&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature is strongly experimental. Both the name and feature will change in next preview release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notable New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rightward assignment statement is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; 55&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endless method definition is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find pattern is added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;e&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; [&quot;a&quot;, 1]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; &quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; &quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; [2, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hash#except&lt;/code&gt; is now built-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;a: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;b: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;c: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; {:b=&amp;gt;2, :c=&amp;gt;3}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many improvements were implemented in MJIT. See NEWS in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other notable changes since 2.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keyword arguments are separated from other arguments.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In principle, code that prints a warning on Ruby 2.7 won’t work. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, arguments forwarding now supports leading arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;method_missing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;meth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:&quot;do_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;meth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$SAFE&lt;/code&gt; was completely removed; now it is a normal global variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of backtrace had been reversed at Ruby 2.5, but it was cancelled. Now it behaves like Ruby 2.4; an error message and the line number where the exception occurs are printed first, and its callers are printed later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some standard libraries are updated.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RubyGems 3.2.0.rc.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundler 2.2.0.rc.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRB 1.2.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reline 0.1.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following libraries are no longer bundled gems. Install corresponding gems to use these features.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;net-telnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xmlrpc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote default gems to bundled gems.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote stdlib to default gems. The following default gems were published on rubygems.org
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;abbrev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;base64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;erb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;io-nonblock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;io-wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net-ftp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net-http&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net-imap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net-protocol&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;resolv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolv-replace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rinda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;securerandom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shellwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tempfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tmpdir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tsort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weakref&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Swift System Is Now Open Source</title>

<description>&lt;header readability=&quot;1.7872340425532&quot;&gt;
&lt;time pubdate=&quot;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-09-25T05:00:00-04:00&quot;&gt;September 25, 2020&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Ilseman is an engineer on the Swift Standard Library team at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Apple introduced Swift System, a new library for Apple platforms that provides idiomatic interfaces to system calls and low-level currency types. Today, I’m excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-system&quot;&gt;System&lt;/a&gt; and adding Linux support! Our vision is for System to eventually act as the single home for low-level system interfaces for all supported Swift platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;goodbye-imported-c-interfaces&quot;&gt;Goodbye Imported C Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most operating systems today support some flavor of system interfaces written in C that have existed for decades. While it is possible to use these APIs directly from Swift, these weakly-typed system interfaces imported from C can be error-prone and unwieldy. For example, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; system call (available on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and Apple platforms) imports as a pair of global functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UnsafePointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;CChar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;oflag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UnsafePointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;CChar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;oflag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mode_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These weakly-typed functions suffer from several shortcomings and fail to utilize the expressivity and type safety of Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File descriptors, alongside options, commands, errno, and other values, are imported as ordinary &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oflag&lt;/code&gt; argument is actually a logical OR-ing of exactly one file access mode and any number of flags, but this is not captured in the type of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oflag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callers of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; have to remember to check for a negative return value indicating an error, and if so check the value of the global variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; to know what error occurred. Additionally, some system calls may be canceled if a signal occurred, requiring callers to remember to write a loop around such calls checking for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EINTR&lt;/code&gt; errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File paths are unmanaged pointers, and if they are derived from a managed object (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Array&amp;lt;CChar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), then callers must ensure that array is always null-terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these semantic rules are captured in the API’s signature, preventing the programming language from guiding the user towards correct usage of the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hello-idiomatic-swift-interfaces&quot;&gt;Hello Idiomatic Swift Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; module brings various language features to bear to improve expressivity and eliminate these opportunities for error. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; defines the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; system call as a static function with defaulted arguments in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; namespace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// Opens or creates a file for reading or writing.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// - Parameters:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///  - path: The location of the file to open.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///  - mode: The read and write access to use.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///  - options: The behavior for opening the file.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///  - permissions: The file permissions to use for created files.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///  - retryOnInterrupt: Whether to retry the open operation&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///    if it throws `Errno.interrupted`.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///    The default is `true`.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///    Pass `false` to try only once and throw an error upon interruption.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// - Returns: A file descriptor for the open file&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// The corresponding C function is `open`.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FilePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;AccessMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;OpenOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;OpenOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;permissions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FilePermissions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;retryOnInterrupt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one compares this version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; to the original version from C, several significant differences stand out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; pervasively uses raw representable structs and option sets. These strong types help catch mistakes at compile time and are trivial to convert to and from the weaker C types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors are thrown using the standard language mechanism and cannot be missed. Further, all system calls interruptible by a signal take a defaulted-true &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;retryOnInterrupt&lt;/code&gt; argument, causing them to retry on failure. When combined, these two changes dramatically simplify error and signal handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FilePath&lt;/code&gt; is a managed, null-terminated bag-of-bytes that conforms to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExpressibleByStringLiteral&lt;/code&gt; — far safer to work with than a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UnsafePointer&amp;lt;CChar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is code that reads and behaves like idiomatic Swift. For example, this code creates a file path from a string literal and uses it to open and append to a log file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FilePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/tmp/log&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;fd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FileDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;writeAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;utf8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-multi-platform-library&quot;&gt;A Multi-platform Library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; is a multi-platform library, not a cross-platform one. It provides a separate set of APIs and behaviors on every supported platform, closely reflecting the underlying OS interfaces. A single &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; will pull in the native platform interfaces specific for the targeted OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our immediate goal is to simplify building cross-platform libraries and applications such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-nio&quot;&gt;SwiftNIO&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager&quot;&gt;Swift Package Manager&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; does not eliminate the need for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#if os()&lt;/code&gt; conditionals to implement cross-platform abstractions, but it does make it safer and more expressive to fill out the platform-specific parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System is only in its infancy—it currently includes a small number of system calls, currency types, and convenience functionality. As part of the effort to increase the API coverage, we’ll be working to adopt System in the Swift Package Manager. This will include &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-system/pull/2&quot;&gt;enhancements to FilePath&lt;/a&gt; and adding support for the recently announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://swift.org/blog/swift-on-windows/&quot;&gt;Swift on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a ton of exciting work left to do. System (especially the forthcoming Windows support!) is a fantastic opportunity to get involved in the Swift project and help it grow into a strong, vibrant, cross-platform ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get Involved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your experience, feedback, and contributions are greatly encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Swift System is Now Open Source</og:title>
<og:url>https://swift.org/blog/swift-system/</og:url>
<og:description>In June, Apple introduced Swift System, a new library for Apple platforms that provides idiomatic interfaces to system calls and low-level currency types. Today, I’m excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing System and adding Linux support! Our vision is for System to eventually act as the single home for low-level system interfaces for all supported Swift platforms.</og:description>

<title>PG and Jessica</title>
<link>https://blog.samaltman.com/pg-and-jessica</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.samaltman.com/pg-and-jessica</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to replicate YC in some other industry or some other place or with some other strategy. In general, people seem to assume that: 1) although there was some degree of mystery or luck about how YC got going, it can’t be that hard, and 2) if you can get it off the ground, the network effects are self-sustaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More YC-like things are good for the world; I generally try to be helpful. But almost none of them work. People are right about the self-sustaining part, but they can’t figure out how to get something going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire secret to YC getting going was PG and Jessica—there was no other magic trick. A few times a year, I end up in a conversation at a party where someone tells a story about how much PG changed their life—people speak with more gratitude than they do towards pretty much anyone else. Then everyone else agrees, YC founders and otherwise (non-YC founders might talk about an impactful essay or getting hired at a YC company). Jessica still sadly doesn’t get nearly the same degree of public credit, but the people who were around the early days of YC know the real story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did they do? They took bets on unknown people and believed in them more than anyone had before. They set strong norms and fought back hard against bad behavior towards YC founders. They trusted their own convictions, were willing to do things their way, and were willing to be disliked by the existing power structures. They focused on the most important things, they worked hard, and they spent a huge amount of time 1:1 with people. They understood the value of community and long-term orientation. When YC was very small, it felt like a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, they built an ecosystem (thanks to Joe Gebbia for pointing this out). This is easy to talk about but hard to do, because it requires not being greedy. YC has left a lot of money on the table; other people have made more money from the ecosystem than YC has itself. This has cemented YC’s place—the benefits to the partners, alumni, current batch founders, Hacker News readers, Demo Day investors, and everyone else around YC is a huge part of what makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if any of this is particularly useful advice—none of it sounds that hard, and yet in the 15 years since, it hasn’t been close to replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems worth trying. I am pretty sure no one has had a bigger total impact on the careers of people in the startup industry over that time period than the two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox&amp;#039;s JIT is getting significantly faster</title>
<link>https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/1PHhxBxSehQ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/1PHhxBxSehQ</guid>
<description>Hi all,&lt;p&gt;The SpiderMonkey (JS) team has been working on a significant update to&lt;br /&gt;our JITs called WarpBuilder (or just Warp) [0,1]. Before we enable&lt;br /&gt;Warp by default in Nightly (hopefully next cycle in 83) we need your&lt;br /&gt;help dogfooding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warp improves performance by reducing the amount of internal type&lt;br /&gt;information that is tracked, optimizing for a broader spectrum of&lt;br /&gt;cases, and by leveraging the same CacheIR optimizations used by last&lt;br /&gt;year’s BaselineInterpreter work [2]. As a result, Warp has a much&lt;br /&gt;simpler design and improves responsiveness and page load performance&lt;br /&gt;significantly (we're seeing 5-15% improvements on many visual metrics&lt;br /&gt;tests). Speedometer is about 10% faster with Warp. The JS engine also&lt;br /&gt;uses less memory when Warp is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable Warp in Nightly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Update to a recent Nightly&lt;br /&gt;2. Go to about:config and set the &quot;javascript.options.warp&quot; pref to true&lt;br /&gt;3. Restart the browser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're especially interested in stability issues and real-world&lt;br /&gt;performance problems. Warp is currently slower on various synthetic JS&lt;br /&gt;benchmarks such as Octane (which we will continue investigating in the&lt;br /&gt;coming months) but should perform well on web content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find any issues, please file bugs blocking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613592&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice any improvements, we'd love to hear about those too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to thank our amazing contributors André Bargull and&lt;br /&gt;Tom Schuster for their help implementing and porting many&lt;br /&gt;optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning Warp on is only our first step, and we expect to see a lot of&lt;br /&gt;new optimization work over the next year as we build on this. We are&lt;br /&gt;excited for what the future holds here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;The Warp team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0] WarpBuilder still utilizes the backend of IonMonkey so we don't&lt;br /&gt;feel it has earned the WarpMonkey name just yet.&lt;br /&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613592&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/the-baseline-interpreter-a-faster-js-interpreter-in-firefox-70/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/the-baseline-interpreter-a-faster-js-interpreter-in-firefox-70/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p id=&quot;fb09&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Whenever you’re just starting out with &lt;a class=&quot;cl fp hz ia ib ic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.codegiant.io/software-development-life-cycle-the-ultimate-guide-2020-153d17bb20fb&quot;&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt; or simply want to uplevel your programming skills, you’ll need the right info resources to achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;993e&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;So, if you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you can jump over to the last section where you’ll find all the 22 YouTube channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2c67&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;If you are a beginner developer, however, I recommend that you go through each section of this article as we’ll talk about coding in general, programming skills, your computer programming resume, job opportunities, and some of the most in-demand programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;65e3&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;359c&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc iw he hf hg ix hi hj hk iy hm hn ho iz hq hr hs ja hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Coding is the end result of a specific set of actions triggered to create a tangible result, whether it is a web page, an app, a video, or just an image on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c92e&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;The great thing about computer coding (or programming) is that you can have a big idea and actually code it out into reality. And it doesn’t cost much, barring some time and effort on your side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e5a&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Many non-tech people consider the definition of a computer programmer to be someone who just makes programs. Although that’s partly true, partly not, it’s a mistake. Managers believe that the more lines of code a programmer can produce a month, the more creative he will be — another mistake. You can’t put a &lt;a class=&quot;cl fp hz ia ib ic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.codegiant.io/software-developer-vs-software-engineer-31e873e787bc&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; into a cubicle, set a deadline, ask him to work for 8–9 hours straight, and expect a top-notch quality software at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9e66&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Instead of thinking about the programs a developer composes, one should consider the possible computations evoked by the developed program. “Designing a set of computations” is a more accurate description of what programmers actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5647&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;One can also imagine programmers as writers that have to think and write carefully, because the readers (the computers) take what the programmers write literally.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;f506&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Many non-tech folks believe that programming is all about acquiring technical skills. I believe that being a developer requires more than just knowing how to code. To make it in the software development world, you’ll need to dig up some creativity and inject it into your coding skills. The ability to think analytically is highly valued among developers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1779&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;One of the most essential skills a developer can have isn’t actually technical, it’s social, and that is empathy. Lack of empathy inevitably leads to poor communication (barring you are a narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath and therefore can be charming as hell). On the other hand, being able to put empathy into practice will, without doubt, boost your career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9732&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;When it comes to &lt;strong class=&quot;hb hx&quot;&gt;planning software&lt;/strong&gt;, developers should know how to use models and flowcharts to convey instructions clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;e7df&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;hb hx&quot;&gt;Debugging code&lt;/strong&gt;. Yup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8ced&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Showing up and practicing your programming skills seem to be the main ingredients to getting better at programming and coding. You gotta be programming in your spare time; you gotta be obsessed with it. Load yourself with patience because becoming a skilled coder takes years. And anyone who is telling you that you can learn and become good at coding in a month is probably trying to sell you something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e25&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Senior developers have all adopted common traits and basic coding skills that have helped them to rise in the hierarchy during their programming careers. Here are some valuable skills needed for you to be a senior developer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3a2c&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;One, being able to easily explain tech stuff to non-technical people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;eb41&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Six, vast knowledge of the technicalities for their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5ec1&quot; class=&quot;jf ie do ce if jg jh he ji jj hi jk jl hm jm jn hq jo jp hu jq eg&quot;&gt;Understand how the language works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e035&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc iw he hf hg ix hi hj hk iy hm hn ho iz hq hr hs ja hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Focus on one language while learning. Having your focus split between two or three languages will discombobulate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c797&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;It becomes obvious when a programmer doesn’t have a good understanding of the programming language he’s using. He’ll try to solve problems by following the logic of other languages and thus litter the code with unnecessary statements that can otherwise be reduced to fewer lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;094c&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Also, you must know how to organize code into a system that makes sense. Creating rigid classes, schemas, and hierarchies require you to first think them through. Design can be a broad topic so I won’t cover much, but if you wish to read more, head over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks&quot; class=&quot;cl fp hz ia ib ic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e256&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Poorly designed software lacks well-defined concepts, and its responsibilities are vague. Good software, on the other hand, comes with clear concepts and responsibilities. Take a look at mathematicians and physicists. They spend a huge amount of time trying to develop a clear definition of something because that will allow them to understand the truth about it. Developers should take a similar approach and spend a considerable amount of time brainstorming before writing code.

&lt;p id=&quot;d2d4&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Most people think that you need a diploma from Harvard or universities alike to be considered for a job in big tech companies. Although that may be partially true (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html&quot; class=&quot;cl fp hz ia ib ic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;not always though, it seems Apple and Google no longer require you to have a college degree&lt;/a&gt;), some companies prefer the opposite, or at least don’t want you to be coming for Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3c6c&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;There are CEOs out there looking for developers that are qualified but not overly qualified… hard workers, being on time, but also leaving at the stroke of 5. Such CEOs consider Ivy League schools to be a red flag. Big resumes are also a red flag. That’s because developers coming from such schools can’t get off their high horse, question whether every decision is optimal, and are always hungry for praise, recognition, and “interesting work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c97a&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Instead, these CEOs are looking for loyal people who know how to take orders without questioning, and are ready to do the work, day in and day out, because they need the paycheck at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6749&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;At a glance, this might seem quite controversial.

Some companies with that kind of culture say that they have produced a 100% employee retention rate which means developers are happy with their work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;2aa7&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;So, what should you list on your resume?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bab&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Proficiency in programming languages is, ostensibly, a vital thing to include. Always remember that companies are getting tens, hundreds, even thousands of applications a month. All of which say “I can do X.” The thing is skill level varies between each applicant. You should describe your coding experience and give examples of successful projects you’ve completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dbb6&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;When listing your most valuable programming skills, there are a couple of things you need to know in order to have a fully optimized programming resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;72b7&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw kd js jt eg&quot;&gt;Before sending your resume, always go through the job description a couple of times and try to understand what is relevant to the job you are applying for. Then make yourself relevant to the job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;dd11&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc ju he hf hg jv hi hj hk jw hm hn ho jx hq hr hs jy hu hv hw kd js jt eg&quot;&gt;Always be honest with yourself. Don’t list programming languages you don’t know because they are mentioned in the job description. Don’t tell them you have 5 years of experience when you only have 4 years and 1 month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;1642&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc ju he hf hg jv hi hj hk jw hm hn ho jx hq hr hs jy hu hv hw kd js jt eg&quot;&gt;Place your programming skills (languages) right at the top, below the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;a384&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc ju he hf hg jv hi hj hk jw hm hn ho jx hq hr hs jy hu hv hw kd js jt eg&quot;&gt;List your most advanced coding skills first, then in the middle list the ones you are least experienced with, and at the end, list the programming skills you have a decent experience with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;44ae&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc ju he hf hg jv hi hj hk jw hm hn ho jx hq hr hs jy hu hv hw kd js jt eg&quot;&gt;Create horizontal categories instead of vertical ones. This eliminates the blank space on your resume while remaining aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;1230&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;In your resume, except for talking about what you bring to the table, you can also mention what you’re looking for in an employer. You’ll thus earn the respect you are looking for if you get the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;48b7&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Also, avoid using phrases that everybody else is using. Don’t be afraid to infuse your CV with some personality. You’ll thus stand out. Not everybody will like your personality, but those that do will adore you. Try to be specific in your writing. Instead of “extensive experience,” say “5 years and 6 months of experience.” Instead of saying “Y number of successful projects,” say “Y amount of successful projects that helped us achieve A, B, and C.” You get the drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3122&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Quite often, though, a seasoned developer will have so much experience and projects under his belt that his resume would spread 10 pages long if he were to list everything. Try to identify what’s most relevant to the job you’re applying for and list those skills and projects that will make you most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f4a8&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;It’s a good idea, although laborious and tiresome, to rewrite your resume for each job you are applying for. Thus you’ll be able to fine-tune some details to look like a great fit in the eyes of the people hiring you. Never send a generic CV; you won’t stand out; you’ll look like “&lt;em class=&quot;hy&quot;&gt;just the next boring applicant in the list,&lt;/em&gt;” and your chances of getting hired will be significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7c24&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;You can also try a different approach when applying for online coding jobs. Some developers send in their “normal” CV (listing computer programming skills, education, experience, etc.) along with another one, a “personal” CV, that explains their previous works on keynote slides with pictures of algorithms and tech stuff. This also wakes up the reader if your CV comes after a batch of 500 boring resumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e1c&quot; class=&quot;gz ha do hb b hc hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw dg eg&quot;&gt;Remember, you have to capture your reader’s attention almost immediately. The attention span of the average person these days is about 8 seconds. Given that your resume will be read by people reading CVs all day long, they’ll probably have a shorter attention span, around 5 seconds, I’d say.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People expect technology to suck because it sucks</title>
<link>https://tonsky.me/blog/tech-sucks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tonsky.me/blog/tech-sucks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Jay Sitter in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kilobitspersecond.com/2020/09/22/people-expect-technology-to-suck/&quot;&gt;People expect technology to suck&lt;/a&gt; writes about people who keep using tech despite heavy annoyances like very dim screen or constant popups and not doing anything about it. He concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my screen were at 5% brightness, or if I couldn’t use my phone without hitting “Cancel” every five seconds, I’d spend hours or days on Google trying to find a solution if that’s what it took. That these people mostly just lived with it means that these problems couldn’t have been markedly worse than technology has already been for them historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples are a bit extreme, but it is important to remember that they are real. This is not an exaggregation. This happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1308718882245562374&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; people keep replying that those users should’ve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;do something about it,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look for a replacement,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or are just being lazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I would agree: if it was just a single case, of course, they should’ve done something about it! The point is, this happens all the time, every day, multiple times a day, and one person can dedicate only so much time to dealing with it. The stream of minor annoyances is so large people just got tired of dealing with it! And no, there’re no better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove my point, I decided to record every broken interaction I had during one day. Here’s the full list I wrote yesterday, September 24, 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;iOS 14 discharged phone battery 80% to 20% during the night (no activity, much worse than iOS 13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube.app randomly scrolled to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram reset scroll position after locking/unlocking the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Race condition in keyboard in DuoLingo during typing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AirPods just randomly reconnected during use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcuts.app stopped reacting to touch for ~30 sec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wondered why my apps were not up to date, found nine apps waiting for manual button click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workflowy cursor obscured by Workflowy toolbar, typing happened behind keyboard:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AirPods showed connected notification, but sound played from the speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passcode unlock worked for the third time only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcast widget disappeared while switching to another app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube forgot video I was just watching after locking/unlocking the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube forgot the resolution I chose for the video, keep resetting me to 360p on a 750p screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On macOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 hour lost trying to connect 4k @ 120 Hz monitor to MacBook Pro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workflowy date autocomplete keeps offering me dates in 2021 instead of 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In macOS context menu, “Tags” is in smaller font:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tonsky.me/blog/tech-sucks/tags.png&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transmission quit unexpectedly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic Trackpad didn’t connect right away after boot, showed the “No Trackpad” window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hammerspoon did not load profile on boot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telegram stuck with one unread message counter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugging iPhone for charging asks for a software update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragging an image from Firefox doesn’t work until I open it in a separate tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube fullscreen is disabled in an embed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack loaded, I started typing a response, then it reloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter was cropping important parts of my image so I had to manually letterbox it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TVTime failed to mark an episode as watched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple TV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infuse took 10 minutes to fetch ~100 file names from smb share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all happened on a single random day! And not a particularly busy one. And I didn’t include anything I did for work that day (VirtualBox alone can produce a list like this in 20 minutes). And I am a professional software developer with 20 years behind the screen every day, learning how to tame it. I imagine I have my setup already organized way more thoroughly than an average person. I am also using the most expensive Apple products and staying strictly inside the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I decided to invest time into thinning this list down, I could theoretically do what? Update some software somewhere so I can charge my iPhone without a popup showing every time? Buy a new MacBook that works with the monitor? I guess I can do something about Hammerspoon, although I already invested two hours into it and didn’t solve it. But I have a feeling it’s solvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that will reduce this list from 27 down to 24! At least 24 annoyances per day I have to live with. That’s the world WE ALL are living in now. Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China blocks Wikimedia Foundation’s accreditation to WIPO</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;848&quot; src=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WIPO_HQ.jpg?w=1024&quot; class=&quot;attachment-large size-large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; srcset=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WIPO_HQ.jpg 1237w, https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WIPO_HQ.jpg?resize=300,248 300w, https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WIPO_HQ.jpg?resize=768,636 768w, https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WIPO_HQ.jpg?resize=1024,848 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;photo-caption&quot;&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Headquarters (the Árpád Bogsch Building also known as the Main Building) in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China yesterday blocked the Wikimedia Foundation’s application for observer status at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the United Nations (UN) organization that develops international treaties on copyright, IP, trademarks, patents and related issues. As a result of the block, the Foundation’s application for observer status has been suspended and will be reconsidered at a future WIPO meeting in 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;China was the only country to raise objections to the accreditation of the Wikimedia Foundation as an official observer. Their last-minute objections claimed Wikimedia’s application was incomplete, and suggested that the Wikimedia Foundation was carrying out political activities via the volunteer-led Wikimedia Taiwan chapter. The United Kingdom and the United States voiced support for the Foundation’s application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WIPO’s work, which shapes international laws and policies that affect the sharing of free knowledge, impacts Wikipedia’s ability to provide hundreds of millions of people with information in their own languages. The Wikimedia Foundation’s absence from these meetings further separates those people from global events that shape their access to knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Wikimedia Foundation operates Wikipedia, one of the most popular sources of information for people around the world. Our organization can provide insights into global issues surrounding intellectual property, copyright law, and treaties addressed by WIPO that ensure access to free knowledge and information,” said Amanda Keton, General Counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation. “The objection by the Chinese delegation limits Wikimedia’s ability to engage with WIPO and interferes with the Foundation’s mission to strengthen access to free knowledge everywhere. We urge WIPO members, including China, to withdraw their objection and approve our application.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A wide range of international and non-profit organizations as well as private companies are official observers of WIPO proceedings and debates. These outside groups offer technical expertise, on-the-ground experience, and diversity of opinions to help WIPO with its global mandate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Wikimedia Foundation calls on the member states of WIPO to reconsider our application for observer status and encourages other UN member states to voice their support for civil society inclusion and international cooperation,” said Keton.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge and advocates for a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MS treatment a step closer after drug shown to repair nerve coating</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/25/ms-treatment-step-closer-drug-shown-to-repair-nerve-coating-trial-multiple-sclerosis</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/25/ms-treatment-step-closer-drug-shown-to-repair-nerve-coating-trial-multiple-sclerosis</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Doctors believe they are closer to a treatment for multiple sclerosis after discovering a drug that repairs the coatings around nerves that are damaged by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;A clinical trial of the cancer drug bexarotene showed that it repaired the protective myelin sheaths that MS destroys. The loss of myelin causes a range of neurological problems including balance, vision and muscle disorders, and ultimately, disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;sign-in-gate&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;While bexarotene cannot be used as a treatment, because the side-effects are too serious, doctors behind the trial said the results showed “remyelination” was possible in humans, suggesting other drugs or drug combinations will halt MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;“It’s disappointing that this is not the drug we’ll use, but it’s exciting that repair is achievable and it gives us great hope for another trial we hope to start this year,” said Prof Alasdair Coles, who led the research at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;MS arises when the immune system mistakenly attacks the fatty myelin coating that wraps around nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Without the lipid-rich substance, signals travel more slowly along nerves, are disrupted, or fail to get through at all. About 100,000 people in the UK live with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Funded by the MS Society, bexarotene was assessed in a phase 2a trial that used brain scans to monitor changes to damaged neurons in patients with relapsing MS. This is an early stage of the condition that precedes secondary progressive disease, where neurons die off and cause permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;The drug had some serious side-effects, from thyroid disease to raised levels of fats in the blood, which can lead to dangerous inflammation of the pancreas. But brain scans revealed that neurons had regrown their myelin sheaths, a finding confirmed by tests that showed signals sent from the retina to the visual cortex at the back of the brain had quickened. “That can only be achieved through remyelination,” said Coles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Details of the work were presented on Friday at MSVirtual2020, a joint meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis and its Americas counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;While bexarotene will not go into phase 3 trials for MS, the finding that the nervous system can be stimulated to resheath damaged neurons has given scientists fresh hopes for another trial they hope to launch later this year. That trial will monitor the effects of the diabetes drug metformin along with clemastine, an antihistamine, a combination that Prof Robin Franklin at the Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/02/diabetes-drug-offers-hope-new-treatment-multiple-sclerosis&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;showed last year&lt;/a&gt; could drive remyelination in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Metformin seems to work by rejuvenating stem cells in the central nervous system, which then go on to become myelin-producing cells called oligodendrocytes. These churn out fresh myelin to replace that destroyed by MS. The researchers hope the drug combination will at least slow the progression of the disease, but there is a chance it will prevent further damage to neurons completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;“The results of this trial give us confidence that medicines that promote myelin regeneration will have a real impact on the treatment of MS, and we look forward to the outcome of future trials with increased optimism,” said Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-38z03z&quot;&gt;Dr Emma Gray, at the MS Society, said: “Finding treatments to stop MS progression is our number one priority, and to do that we need ways to protect nerves from damage and repair lost myelin. This new research is a major milestone in our plan to stop MS and we’re incredibly excited about the potential it’s shown for future studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The US is using the Guardian to justify jailing Assange for life</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Julian Assange is not on trial simply for his liberty and his life. He is fighting for the right of every journalist to do hard-hitting investigative journalism without fear of arrest and extradition to the United States. Assange faces 175 years in a US super-max prison on the basis of claims by Donald Trump’s administration that his exposure of US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan amounts to “espionage”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges against Assange rewrite the meaning of “espionage” in unmistakably dangerous ways. Publishing evidence of state crimes, as Assange’s Wikileaks organisation has done, is covered by both free speech and public interest defences. Publishing evidence furnished by whistleblowers is at the heart of any journalism that aspires to hold power to account and in check. Whistleblowers typically emerge in reaction to parts of the executive turning rogue, when the state itself starts breaking its own laws. That is why journalism is protected in the US by the First Amendment. Jettison that and one can no longer claim to live in a free society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware that journalists might understand this threat and rally in solidarity with Assange, US officials initially pretended that they were not seeking to prosecute the Wikileaks founder for journalism – in fact, they denied he was a journalist. That was why they preferred to charge him under the arcane, highly repressive Espionage Act of 1917. The goal was to isolate Assange and persuade other journalists that they would not share his fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange explained this US strategy way back in 2011, in a fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/11763267503/extended-interview-with-julian-assange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; he gave to Australian journalist Mark Davis. (The relevant section occurs from minute 24 to 43.) This was when the Obama administration first began seeking a way to distinguish Assange from liberal media organisations, such as the New York Times and Guardian that had been working with him, so that only he would be charged with espionage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4562&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-16-at-13.02.43.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-16-at-13.02.43.png 520w, https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-16-at-13.02.43-300x246.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange warned then that the New York Times and its editor Bill Keller had already set a terrible precedent on legitimising the administration’s redefinition of espionage by assuring the Justice Department – falsely, as it happens – that they had been simply passive recipients of Wikileaks’ documents. Assange noted (40.00 mins):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I am a conspirator to commit espionage, then all these other media organisations and the principal journalists in them are also conspirators to commit espionage. What needs to be done is to have a united face in this.&lt;span&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of the current extradition hearings, US officials have found it much harder to make plausible this distinction principle than they may have assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalism is an activity, and anyone who regularly engages in that activity qualifies as a journalist. It is not the same as being a doctor or a lawyer, where you need a specific professional qualification to practice. You are a journalist if you do journalism – and you are an investigative journalist if, like Assange, you publish information the powerful want concealed. Which is why in the current extradition hearings at the Old Bailey in London, the arguments made by lawyers for the US that Assange is not a journalist but rather someone engaged in espionage are coming unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Corporate journalists have barely bothered to cover Assange's trial. But while they doze, the US has changed its argument, as ex-ambassador Craig Murray reports. Now the US is threatening to lock up other journalists for espionage if they expose its crimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4dpYUQ0EAZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4dpYUQ0EAZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jonathan_K_Cook/status/1306188681359880192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dictionary defines “espionage” as “the practice of spying or of using spies, typically by governments to obtain political and military information”. A spy is defined as someone who “secretly obtains information on an enemy or competitor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very obviously the work of Wikileaks, a transparency organisation, is not secret. By publishing the Afghan and Iraq war diaries, Wikileaks exposed crimes the United States wished to keep secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange did not help a rival state to gain an advantage, he helped all of us become better informed about the crimes our own states commit in our names. He is on trial not because he traded in secrets, but because he blew up the business of secrets – the very kind of secrets that have enabled the west to pursue permanent, resource-grabbing wars and are pushing our species to the verge of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Assange was doing exactly what journalists claim to do every day in a democracy: monitor power for the public good. Which is why ultimately the Obama administration abandoned the idea of issuing an indictment against Assange. There was simply no way to charge him without also putting journalists at the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Guardian on trial too. And doing that would have made explicit that the press is not free but works on licence from those in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Media indifference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason alone, one might have imagined that the entire media – from rightwing to liberal-left outlets – would be up in arms about Assange’s current predicament. After all, the practice of journalism as we have known it for at least 100 years is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact, as Assange feared nine years ago, the media have chosen not to adopt a “united face” – or at least, not a united face with Wikileaks. They have remained all but silent. They have ignored – apart from occasionally to ridicule – Assange’s terrifying ordeal, even though he has been locked up for many months in Belmarsh high-security prison awaiting efforts to extradite him as a spy. Assange’s very visible and prolonged physical and mental abuse – both in Belmarsh and, before that, in the Ecuadorian embassy, where he was given political asylum – have already served part of their purpose: to deter young journalists from contemplating following in his footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4565&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EVZlkjTXgAAIKKC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EVZlkjTXgAAIKKC.jpg 520w, https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EVZlkjTXgAAIKKC-293x300.jpg 293w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more astounding is the fact that the media have taken no more than a cursory interest in the events of the extradition hearing itself. What reporting there has been has given no sense of the gravity of the proceedings or the threat they pose to the public’s right to know what crimes are being committed in their name. Instead, serious, detailed coverage has been restricted to a handful of independent outlets and bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most troubling of all, the media have not reported the fact that during the hearing lawyers for the US have abandoned the implausible premise of their main argument that Assange’s work did not constitute journalism. Now they appear to accept that Assange did indeed do journalism, and that other journalists could suffer his fate. What was once implicit has become explicit, as Assange warned: any journalist who exposes serious state crimes now risks the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; of being locked away for the rest of their lives under the draconian Espionage Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The BBC's Kuenssberg and ITV's Peston haven't mentioned Assange for years, even as his extradition hearing – our generation's Dreyfus Trial – is under way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be proof, if more were needed, that these people aren't journalists, they are courtiers of the British state &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2ybAEkoAhz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2ybAEkoAhz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jonathan_K_Cook/status/1303308023499288576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This glaring indifference to the case and its outcome is extremely revealing about what we usually refer to as the “mainstream” media. In truth, there is nothing mainstream or popular about this kind of media. It is in reality a media elite, a corporate media, owned by and answerable to billionaire owners – or in the case of the BBC, ultimately to the state – whose interests it really serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate media’s indifference to Assange’s trial hints at the fact that it is actually doing very little of the sort of journalism that threatens corporate and state interests and that challenges real power. It won’t suffer Assange’s fate because, as we shall see, it doesn’t attempt to do the kind of journalism Assange and his Wikileaks organisation specialise in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indifference suggests rather starkly that the primary role of the corporate media – aside from its roles in selling us advertising and keeping us pacified through entertainment and consumerism – is to serve as an arena in which rival centres of power within the establishment fight for their narrow interests, settling scores with each other, reinforcing narratives that benefit them, and spreading disinformation against their competitors. On this battlefield, the public are mostly spectators, with our interests only marginally affected by the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A journalist due to testify at Julian Assange's extradition hearing makes a very pertinent point. This is the biggest attack on press freedom in our lifetimes. Why are UK editors not demanding to be heard at the Old Bailey? Where are they? Where is the Guardian? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fFRFvGpYdi&quot;&gt;https://t.co/fFRFvGpYdi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jonathan_K_Cook/status/1303261218292011008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gauntlet thrown down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate media in the US and UK is no more diverse and pluralistic than the major corporate-funded political parties they identify with. This kind of media mirrors the same flaws as the Republican and Democratic parties in the US: they cheerlead consumption-based, globalised capitalism; they favour a policy of unsustainable, infinite growth on a finite planet; and they invariably support colonial, profit-driven, resource-grabbing wars, nowadays often dressed up as humanitarian intervention. The corporate media and the corporate political parties serve the interests of the same power establishment because they are equally embedded in that establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In this context, it was revealing that when Assange’s lawyers argued earlier this year that he could not be extradited to the US because extradition for political work is barred under its treaty with the UK, the US insisted that Assange be denied this defence. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://consortiumnews.com/2020/02/27/assange-extradition-your-man-in-public-gallery-day-no-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that “political” referred narrowly to “party political” – that is, politics that served the interests of a recognised party.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outset, the work of Assange and Wikileaks threatened to disrupt the cosy relationship between the media elite and the political elite. Assange threw down a gauntlet to journalists, especially those in the liberal parts of the media, who present themselves as fearless muckrakers and watchdogs on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the corporate media, Wikileaks doesn’t depend on access to those in power for its revelations, or on the subsidies of billionaires, or on income from corporate advertisers. Wikileaks receives secret documents direct from whistleblowers, giving the public an unvarnished, unmediated perspective on what the powerful are doing – and what they want us to think they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikileaks has allowed us to see raw, naked power before it puts on a suit and tie, slicks back its hair and conceals the knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as this has been an empowering development for the general public, it is at best a very mixed blessing for the corporate media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today’s column is a salute to Julian Assange, selflessly raising the bar on nightmare houseguest stories &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bgqeEakGBj&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bgqeEakGBj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Hadley Freeman (@HadleyFreeman) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HadleyFreeman/status/1119539990155935744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2010, the fledgling Wikileaks organisation received its first tranche of documents from US army whistleblower Chelsea Manning: hundreds of thousands of classified files exposing US crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange and “liberal” elements of the corporate media were briefly and uncomfortably thrown into each others’ arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Assange needed the manpower and expertise provided by big-hitting newspapers like the New York Times, the Guardian and Der Spiegel to help Wikileaks sift through vast trove to find important, hidden disclosures. He also needed the mass audiences those papers could secure for the revelations, as well as those outlets’ ability to set the news agenda in other media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberal media, on the other hand, needed to court Assange and Wikileaks to avoid being left behind in the media war for big, Pulitzer Prize-winning stories, for audience share and for revenues. Each worried that, were it not to do a deal with Wikileaks, a rival would publish those world-shattering exclusives instead and erode its market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gatekeeper role under threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief while, this mutual dependency just about worked. But only for a short time. In truth, the liberal corporate media is far from committed to a model of unmediated, whole-truth journalism. The Wikileaks model undermined the corporate media’s relationship to the power establishment and threatened its access. It introduced a tension and division between the functions of the political elite and the media elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those intimate and self-serving ties are illustrated in the most famous example of corporate media working with a “whistleblower”: the use of a source, known as Deep Throat, who exposed the crimes of President Richard Nixon to Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein back in the early 1970s, in what became known as Watergate. That source, it emerged much later, was actually the associate director of the FBI, Mark Felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC3YFyah_Yg&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from being driven to bring down Nixon out of principle, Felt wished to settle a score with the administration after he was passed over for promotion. Later, and quite separately, Felt was convicted of authorising his own Watergate-style crimes on behalf of the FBI. In the period before it was known that Felt had been Deep Throat, President Ronald Reagan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/james-comey-firing-trump-fbi-hoover&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;pardoned&lt;/a&gt; him for those crimes. It is perhaps not surprising that this less than glorious context is never mentioned in the self-congratulatory coverage of Watergate by the corporate media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But worse than the potential rupture between the media elite and the political elite, the Wikileaks model implied an imminent redundancy for the corporate media. In publishing Wikileaks’ revelations, the corporate media feared it was being reduced to the role of a platform – one that could be discarded later – for the publication of truths sourced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undeclared role of the corporate media, dependent on corporate owners and corporate advertising, is to serve as gatekeeper, deciding which truths should be revealed in the “public interest”, and which whistleblowers will be allowed to disseminate which secrets in their possession. The Wikileaks model threatened to expose that gatekeeping role, and make clearer that the criterion used by corporate media for publication was less “public interest” than “corporate interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, from the start the relationship between Assange and “liberal” elements of the corporate media was fraught with instability and antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate media had two possible responses to the promised Wikileaks revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was to get behind it. But that was not straightforward. As we have noted, Wikileaks’ goal of transparency was fundamentally at odds both with the corporate media’s need for access to members of the power elite and with its embedded role, representing one side in the “competition” between rival power centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I bet Assange is stuffing himself full of flattened guinea pigs. He really is the most massive turd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— suzanne moore (@suzanne_moore) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/suzanne_moore/status/215209474716209152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 19, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate media’s other possible response was to get behind the political elite’s efforts to destroy Wikileaks. Once Wikileaks and Assange were disabled, there could be a return to media business as usual. Outlets would once again chase tidbits of information from the corridors of power, getting “exclusives” from the power centres they were allied with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in simple terms, Fox News would continue to get self-serving exclusives against the Democratic party, and MSNBC would get self-serving exclusives against Trump and the Republican Party. That way, everyone would get a slice of editorial action and advertising revenue – and nothing significant would change. The power elite in its two flavours, Democrat and Republican, would continue to run the show unchallenged, switching chairs occasionally as elections required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From dependency to hostility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typifying the media’s fraught, early relationship with Assange and Wikileaks – sliding rapidly from initial dependency to outright hostility – was the Guardian. It was a major beneficiary of the Afghan and Iraq war diaries, but very quickly turned its guns on Assange. (Notably, the Guardian would also lead the attack in the UK on the former leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, who was seen as threatening a “populist” political insurgency in parallel to Assange’s “populist” media insurgency.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being widely viewed as a bastion of liberal-left journalism, the Guardian has been actively complicit in rationalising Assange’s confinement and abuse over the past decade and in trivialising the threat posed to him and the future of real journalism by Washington’s long-term efforts to permanently lock him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not enough space on this page to highlight all the appalling examples of the Guardian’s ridiculing of Assange (a few illustrative tweets scattered through this post will have to suffice) and disparaging of renowned experts in international law who have tried to focus attention on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2016-02-06/lies-about-un-body-imperil-not-just-assange/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;arbitrary detention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25249&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;. But the compilation of headlines in the tweet below conveys an impression of the antipathy the Guardian has long harboured for Assange, most of it – such as James Ball’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-wikileaks-us-sweden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; – now exposed as journalistic malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s failings have extended too to the current extradition hearings, which have stripped away years of media noise and character assassination to make plain why Assange has been deprived of his liberty for the past 10 years: because the US wants revenge on him for publishing evidence of its crimes and seeks to deter others from following in his footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its pages, the Guardian has barely bothered to cover the case, running superficial, repackaged agency copy. This week it belatedly ran a solitary opinion piece from Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s former leftwing president, to mark the fact that many dozens of former world leaders have called on the UK to halt the extradition proceedings. They appear to appreciate the gravity of the case much more clearly than the Guardian and most other corporate media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But among the Guardian’s own columnists, even its supposedly leftwing ones like Gorge Monbiot and Owen Jones, there has been blanket silence about the hearings. In familiar style, the only in-house commentary on the case so far is yet another snide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/09/politicising-and-weaponising-are-becoming-rather-convenient-arguments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hit-piece&lt;/a&gt; – this one in the fashion section written by Hadley Freeman. It simply ignores the terrifying developments for journalism taking place at the Old Bailey, close by the Guardian’s offices. Instead Freeman mocks the credible fears of Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, that, if Assange is extradited, his two young children may not be allowed contact with their father again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman’s goal, as has been typical of the Guardian’s modus operandi, is not to raise an issue of substance about what is happening to Assange but to score hollow points in a distracting culture war the paper has become so well-versed in monetising. In her piece, entitled “Ask Hadley: ‘Politicising’ and ‘weaponising’ are becoming rather convenient arguments”, Freeman exploits Assange and Moris’s suffering to advance her own convenient argument that the word “politicised” is much misused – especially, it seems, when criticising the Guardian for its treatment of Assange and Corbyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper could not make it any plainer. It dismisses the idea that it is a “political” act for the most militarised state on the planet to put on trial a journalist for publishing evidence of its systematic war crimes, with the aim of locking him up permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Password divulged&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian may be largely ignoring the hearings, but the Old Bailey is far from ignoring the Guardian. The paper’s name has been cited over and over again in court by lawyers for the US. They have regularly quoted from a 2011 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/WikiLeaks-Inside-Julian-Assanges-Secrecy/dp/1783350172/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;qid=1600685398&amp;amp;refinements=p_27%3ADavid+Leigh&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;text=David+Leigh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;book on Assange&lt;/a&gt; by two Guardian reporters, David Leigh and Luke Harding, to bolster the Trump administration’s increasingly frantic arguments for extraditing Assange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Leigh worked with Assange, back in 2010, he was the Guardian’s investigations editor and, it should be noted, the brother-in-law of the then-editor, Alan Rusbridger. Harding, meanwhile, is a long-time reporter whose main talent appears to be churning out Guardian books at high speed that closely track the main concerns of the UK and US security services. In the interests of full disclosure, I should note that I had underwhelming experiences dealing with both of them during my years working at the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally a newspaper would not hesitate to put on its front page reports of the most momentous trial of recent times, and especially one on which the future of journalism depends. That imperative would be all the stronger were its own reporters’ testimony likely to be critical in determining the outcome of the trial. For the Guardian, detailed and prominent reporting of, and commentary on, the Assange extradition hearings should be a double priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how to explain the Guardian’s silence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book by Leigh and Harding, &lt;em&gt;WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy, &lt;/em&gt;made a lot of money for the Guardian and its authors by hurriedly cashing in on the early notoriety around Assange and Wikileaks. But the problem today is that the Guardian has precisely no interest in drawing attention to the book outside the confines of a repressive courtroom. Indeed, were the book to be subjected to any serious scrutiny, it might now look like an embarrassing, journalistic fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two authors used the book not only to vent their personal animosity towards Assange – in part because he refused to let them write his official biography – but also to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/guardian-journalist-accused-of-recklessly-disclosing-password-2347842.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;divulge a complex password&lt;/a&gt; entrusted to Leigh by Assange that provided access to an online cache of encrypted documents. That egregious mistake by the Guardian opened the door for every security service in the world to break into the file, as well as other files once they could crack Assange’s sophisticated formula for devising passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the furore about Assange’s supposed failure to protect names in the leaked documents published by Assange – now at the heart of the extradition case – stems from Leigh’s much-obscured role in sabotaging Wikileaks’ work. Assange was forced into a damage limitation operation because of Leigh’s incompetence, forcing him to hurriedly publish files so that anyone worried they had been named in the documents could know before hostile security services identified them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Guardian has sought for nearly a decade to obscure David Leigh's deeply irresponsible antics in publishing that critically important Wikileaks password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's another reason why the Guardian has barely covered the Assange hearings. It goes way beyond 'conflict of interest'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jonathan_K_Cook/status/1308344424179605504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week at the Assange hearings, Professor Christian Grothoff, a computer expert at Bern University, noted that Leigh had recounted in his 2011 book how he pressured a reluctant Assange into giving him the password. In his testimony, Grothoff &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;referred&lt;/a&gt; to Leigh as a “bad faith actor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Not a reliable source’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade ago Leigh and Harding could not have imagined what would be at stake all these years later – for Assange and for other journalists – because of an accusation in their book that the Wikileaks founder recklessly failed to redact names before publishing the Afghan and Iraq war diaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of the accusation rests on Leigh’s highly contentious recollection of a discussion with three other journalists and Assange at a restaurant near the Guardian’s former offices in July 2010, shortly before publication of the Afghan revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Leigh, during a conversation about the risks of publication to those who had worked with the US, Assange said: “They’re informants, they deserve to die.” Lawyers for the US have repeatedly cited this line as proof that Assange was indifferent to the fate of those identified in the documents and so did not expend care in redacting names. (Let us note, as an aside, that the US has failed to show that anyone was actually put in harm’s way from publication, and in the Manning trial a US official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/bradley-manning-sentencing-hearing-pentagon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that no one had been harmed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Leigh’s recollection of the dinner has not been confirmed by anyone else, and is hotly disputed by another participant, John Goetz of Der Spiegel. He has sworn an affidavit saying Leigh is wrong. He gave testimony at the Old Bailey for the defence last week. Extraordinarily the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, refused to allow him to contest Leigh’s claim, even though lawyers for the US have repeatedly cited that claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Statement from journalist John Goetz of Der Spiegel attesting that Assange never made the &quot;they deserve it&quot; comment he was accused of saying by The Guardian's David Leigh. Goetz was at the dinner Assange is alleged to have said it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wexkKhwKg7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/wexkKhwKg7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FdFRAG4oNH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FdFRAG4oNH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Goetz, as well as Nicky Hager, an investigative journalist from New Zealand, and Professor John Sloboda, of Iraq Body Count, all of whom worked with Wikileaks to redact names at different times, have testified that Assange was meticulous about the redaction process. Goetz &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/us-informants-not-harmed-by-wikileaks-releases-assange-extradition-trial-told/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that he had been personally exasperated by the delays imposed by Assange to carry out redactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I remember being very, very irritated by the constant, unending reminders by Assange that we needed to be secure, that we needed to encrypt things, that we needed to use encrypted chats. … The amount of precautions around the safety of the material were enormous. I thought it was paranoid and crazy but it later became standard journalistic practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Sloboda noted that, as Goetz had implied in his testimony, the pressure to cut corners on redaction came not from Assange but from Wikileaks’ “media partners”, who were desperate to get on with publication. One of the most prominent of those partners, of course, was the Guardian. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-11/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; of proceedings at the Old Bailey by former UK ambassador Craig Murray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goetz [of Der Spiegel] recalled an email from David Leigh of The Guardian stating that publication of some stories was delayed because of the amount of time WikiLeaks were devoting to the redaction process to get rid of the “bad stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted by US counsel with Leigh’s claim in the book about the restaurant conversation, Hager &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; witheringly: “I would not regard that [Leigh and Harding’s book] as a reliable source.” Under oath, he ascribed Leigh’s account of the events of that time to “animosity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scoop exposed as fabrication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harding is hardly a dispassionate observer either. His most recent “scoop” on Assange, published in the Guardian two years ago, has been exposed as an entirely fabricated smear. It claimed that Assange secretly met a Trump aide, Paul Manafort, and unnamed “Russians” while he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-4537&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/manafort.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/manafort.png 520w, https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/manafort-300x136.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harding’s transparent aim in making this false claim was to revive a so-called “Russiagate” smear suggesting that, in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election, Assange conspired with the Trump camp and Russian president Vladimir Putin to help get Trump elected. These allegations proved pivotal in alienating Democrats who might otherwise have rallied to Assange’s side, and have helped forge bipartisan support for Trump’s current efforts to extradite Assange and jail him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now forgotten context for these claims was Wikileaks’ publication shortly before the election of a stash of internal Democratic party emails. They exposed corruption, including efforts by Democratic officials to sabotage the party’s primaries to undermine Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton’s rival for the party’s presidential nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those closest to the release of the emails have maintained that they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4034038/Ex-British-ambassador-WikiLeaks-operative-claims-Russia-did-NOT-provide-Clinton-emails-handed-D-C-park-intermediary-disgusted-Democratic-insiders.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; by a Democratic party insider. But the Democratic leadership had a pressing need to deflect attention from what the emails revealed. Instead they actively sought to warm up a Cold War-style narrative that the emails had been hacked by Russia to foil the US democratic process and get Trump into power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No evidence was ever produced for this allegation. Harding, however, was one of the leading proponents of the Russiagate narrative, producing another of his famously fast turnaround books on the subject, Collusion. The complete absence of any supporting evidence for Harding’s claims was exposed in dramatic fashion when he was questioned by journalist Aaron Mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ikf1uZli4g&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harding’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/manafort-held-secret-talks-with-assange-in-ecuadorian-embassy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2018 story&lt;/a&gt; about Manafort was meant to add another layer of confusing mischief to an already tawdry smear campaign. But problematically for Harding, the Ecuadorian embassy at the time of Manafort’s supposed visit was probably the most heavily surveilled building in London. The CIA, as we would later learn, had even &lt;a href=&quot;https://consortiumnews.com/2020/05/15/assange-extradition-court-files-expose-sheldon-adelsons-security-team-in-us-spying-on-assange/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;illegally installed&lt;/a&gt; cameras inside Assange’s quarters to spy on him. There was no way that Manafort and various “Russians” could have visited Assange without leaving a trail of video evidence. And yet none exists. Rather than retract the story, the Guardian has &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/01/02/five-weeks-after-the-guardians-viral-blockbuster-assangemanafort-scoop-no-evidence-has-emerged-just-stonewalling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;gone to ground&lt;/a&gt;, simply refusing to engage with critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, either Harding or a source were fed the story by a security service in a further bid to damage Assange. Harding made not even the most cursory checks to ensure that his “exclusive” was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unwilling to speak in court&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite both Leigh and Harding’s dismal track record in their dealings with Assange, one might imagine that at this critical point – as Assange faces extradition and jail for doing journalism – the pair would want to have their voices heard directly in court rather than allow lawyers to speak for them or allow other journalists to suggest unchallenged that they are “unreliable” or “bad faith” actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leigh could testify at the Old Bailey that he stands by his claims that Assange was indifferent to the dangers posed to informants; or he could concede that his recollection of events may have been mistaken; or clarify that, whatever Assange said at the infamous dinner, he did in fact work scrupulously to redact names – as other witnesses have testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the grave stakes, for Assange and for journalism, that would be the only honourable thing for Leigh to do: to give his testimony and submit to cross-examination. Instead he shelters behind the US counsel’s interpretation of his words and Judge Baraitser’s refusal to allow anyone else to challenge it, as though Leigh brought his claim down from the mountain top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian too, given it central role in the Assange saga, might have been expected to insist on appearing in court, or at the very least to be publishing editorials furiously defending Assange from the concerted legal assault on his rights and journalism’s future. The Guardian’s “star” leftwing columnists, figures like George Monbiot and Owen Jones, might similarly be expected to be rallying readers’ concerns, both in the paper’s pages and on their own social media accounts. Instead they have barely raised their voices above a whisper, as though fearful for their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These failings are not about the behaviour of any single journalist. They reflect a culture at the Guardian, and by extension in the wider corporate media, that abhors the kind of journalism Assange promoted: a journalism that is open, genuinely truth-seeking, non-aligned and collaborative rather than competitive. The Guardian wants journalism as a closed club, one where journalists are once again treated as high priests by their flock of readers, who know only what the corporate media is willing to disclose to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange understood the problem back in 2011, as he explained in his interview with Mark Davis (38.00mins):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a point I want to make about perceived moral institutions, such as the Guardian and New York Times. The Guardian has good people in it. It also has a coterie of people at the top who have other interests. … What drives a paper like the Guardian or New York Times is not their inner moral values. It is simply that they have a market. In the UK, there is a market called “educated liberals”. Educated liberals want to buy a newspaper like the Guardian and therefore an institution arises to fulfil that market. … What is in the newspaper is not a reflection of the values of the people in that institution, it is a reflection of the market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That market demand, in turn, is shaped not by moral values but by economic forces – forces that need a media elite, just as they do a political elite, to shore up an ideological worldview that keeps those elites in power. Assange threatened to bring that whole edifice crashing down. That is why the institutions of the Guardian and the New York Times will shed no more tears than Donald Trump and Joe Biden if Assange ends up spending the rest of his life behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Hearing Day 17</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;During the hearing of medical evidence the last three days, the British government has been caught twice directly telling important lies about events in Belmarsh prison, each lie proven by documentary evidence. The common factor has been the medical records kept by Dr Daly, head of the jail’s medical services. There has also been, to put it at its very lightest, one apparent misrepresentation by Dr Daly. Personally, I am wary of the kind of person who impresses Ross Kemp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1249.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;742&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-60679&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1249.png 742w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1249-300x144.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a still of Dr Daly from Ross Kemp’s documentary on Belmarsh prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1250-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-60681&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1250-1.png 1267w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1250-1-300x171.png 300w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1250-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-1250-1-768x437.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1267px) 100vw, 1267px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Mr Kemp’s description of the medical wing at Belmarsh: “Security is on another level here with six times more staff per inmate than the rest of the jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the medical wing or “healthcare”, Julian Assange was in effect in solitary confinement, and three psychiatrists and a physician with extensive experience of treating trauma have all testified in court that Assange’s mental and physical condition deteriorated while he was in “healthcare” for several months. They also said he improved after he left “healthcare”. That says something profound about the “healthcare” being provided. The same doctors testified that Assange has a poor relationship with Dr Daly and will not confide his symptoms or feelings to her, and this has also been asserted by defence council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all essential background to the lies. Now let me come to the lies. Unfortunately to do so I must reveal details of Julian’s medical condition which I had withheld, but I think the situation is so serious I must now do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not report that Professor Michael Kopelman gave evidence that, among other preparations for suicide, Julian Assange had hidden a razor blade in his folded underwear, but this had been discovered in a search of his cell. As I did report, Kopelman was subjected to an extremely aggressive cross-examination by James Lewis, which in the morning had focused on the notion that Julian Assange’s mental illness was simply malingering, and that Kopelman had failed to detect this. The razor blade was a key factor in Lewis’s browbeating of Kopelman, and he attacked him on it again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis stated that Kopelman “relied on” the razor blade story for his diagnosis. He then proceeded to portray it as a fantasy concocted by Assange to support his malingering. Lewis asked Kopelman repeatedly why, if the story were true, it was not in Dr Daly’s clinical notes? Surely if a prisoner, known to be depressive, had a razor blade found in his cell, it would be in the prison medical records? Why had Prof Kopelman failed to note in his report that there was no evidence for the razor blade in Dr Daly’s medical records? Was he hiding that information? Was it not very strange that this incident would not be in the medical notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to humiliate Kopelman, Lewis said&lt;br/&gt;“You say you do not rely on the razor blade for your diagnosis. But you do rely on it. Let us then look at your report. You rely on the razor blade at paragraph 8. You mention it again at paragraph 11a. Then 11c. Then paragraph 14, paragraph 16, 17b, 18a. Then we come to the next section and the razor blade is there at paragraph 27 and 28. Then again in the summary it is at paragraphs 36 and again at paragraph 38. So tell me Professor, how can you say that you do not rely on the razor blade?”&lt;br/&gt;[I do not give the actual paragraph numbers; these are illustrative].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis then went on to invite Kopelman to change his diagnosis. He asked him more than once if his diagnosis would be different if there was no razor blade and it were an invention by Assange. Kopelman was plainly unnerved by this attack. He agreed it was “very odd indeed” it was not mentioned in the medical notes if it were true. The plain attack that he had naively believed an obvious lie disconcerted Kopelman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it was Lewis who was not telling the truth. There really was a concealed razor blade, and what Assange had told Kopelman, and what Kopelman had believed, was true in every single detail. In a scene straight out of a TV legal drama, during Kopelman’s testimony, the defence had managed to obtain the charge sheet from Belmarsh Prison – Assange had been charged with the offence of the razor blade. The charge sheet is dated 09.00 on 7 May 2019, and this is what it reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 05/05/19 at approximately 15.30, myself and Officer Carroll were conducting a routine matrix search in 2-1-37 solely occupied by Mr Assange A9379AY. He was asked before we began the search if everything in the cell belonged to him, to which he replied “To my knowledge yes”. During the process of this search I lifted a pair of his personal underwear up whilst searching the cupboard. When I lifted them I heard a metal object drop inside the cupboard. When I investigated what it was I saw half of a razor blade which had been concealed in his personal underwear. This had now been placed in evidence bag number M0001094.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed&lt;br/&gt;Off Locke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was later shown a copy and got a quick shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/razor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-60687&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/razor.jpg 1280w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/razor-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/razor-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/razor-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When on Tuesday Edward Fitzgerald QC produced this charge sheet in court, it did not appear to be news to the prosecution. James Lewis QC panicked. Rather too quickly, Lewis leapt to his feet and asked the judge that it should be noted that he had never said that there was no razor blade. Fitzgerald responded that was not the impression that had been given. From the witness box and under oath, Kopelman stated that was not the impression he had been given either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was most certainly not the impression I had been given in the public gallery. In repeatedly asserting that, if the razor blade existed, it would be in the medical notes, Lewis had, at the very least, misled the witness on a material question of fact, that had actually affected his evidence. And Lewis had done so precisely in order to affect the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panicking, Lewis then gave the game away further by making the desperate assertion that the charge against Mr Assange had been dismissed by the Governor. So the prosecution definitely knew rather more about the events around the razor blade than the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser, who was aware that this was a major car crash, grasped at the same straw Lewis was clinging to in desperation, and said that if the charge had been dismissed, then there was no proof the razor blade existed. Fitzgerald pointed out this was absurd. The charge may have been dismissed for numerous reasons. The existence of the blade was not in doubt. Julian Assange had attested to it and two prison warders had attested to it. Baraitser said that she could only base her view on the decision of the Prison Governor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However Baraitser may try to hide it, Lewis attacked Prof Kopelman over the existence of the blade when Lewis gave every appearance afterwards of a man who knew full well all along that there was compelling evidence the blade did exist. For Baraitser to try to protect both Lewis and the prosecution by pretending the existence of the blade is dependent on the outcome of the subsequent charge, when all three people in the cell at the time of the search agreed to its existence, including Assange, is perhaps Baraitser’s most remarkable abuse of legal procedure yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his evidence, I went for a gin and tonic with Professor Kopelman, who is an old friend. We had no contact at all for two years, precisely because of his involvement in the Assange case as a medical expert. Michael was very worried he had not performed strongly in his evidence session in the morning, though he had been able to answer more clearly in the afternoon. And his concern about the morning was because he had been put off by the razor blade question. He had firmly understood Lewis to be saying that there was no razor blade in prison records and Michael had therefore been deceived by Julian. If he had been deceived, it of course would have been a professional failing and Lewis had successfully caused him anxiety while in the witness box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make plain I do not believe for one moment the government side were not aware all along the razor blade was real. Lewis cross-examined using detailed prepared notes on the razor blade and with all the references to it tabulated in Kopelman’s report. That this was undertaken by the prosecution without asking the prison if the incident were true, defies common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday Edward Fitzgerald handed the record of the prison hearing where the charge was discussed to Baraitser. It was a long document. The Governor’s decision was at paragraph 19. Baraitser told Fitzgerald she could not accept the document as it was new evidence. Fitzgerald told her she had herself asked for the outcome of the charge. He said the document contained very interesting information. Baraitser said that the Governor’s decision was at paragraph 19, that was all she had asked for, and she would refuse to take the rest of the document into consideration. Fitzgerald said the defence may wish to make a formal submission on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen this document. Based on Baraitser’s earlier pronouncements, I am fairly certain she is protecting Lewis in this way. At para 19 the Governor’s decision probably dismisses the charges as Lewis said. But the earlier paras, which Baraitser refuses to consider, almost certainly make plain that Assange’s possession of the razor blade was undisputed, and very probably explains his intention to use it for suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to quote Lewis himself, why would this not be in Dr Daly’s medical notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even that startling story I did not consider sufficiently powerful to justify publishing the alarming personal details about Julian. But then it happened again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning, Dr Nigel Blackwood, Reader in Forensic Psychiatry at Kings College London, gave evidence for the prosecution. He essentially downplayed all of Julian’s diagnoses of mental illness, and disputed he had Asperger’s. In the course of this downplaying, he stated that when Julian had been admitted to the healthcare wing on 18 April 2019, it had not been for any medical reason. It had been purely to isolate him from other prisoners because of the video footage of him that had been taken and released by a prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald asked Blackwood how he knew this, and Blackwood said Dr Daly had told him for his report. The defence now produced another document from the prison that showed the government was lying. It was a report from prison staff dated 2.30pm on 18 April 2019 and specifically said that Julian was “very low” and having uncontrollable suicidal urges. It suggested moving him to the medical wing and mentioned a meeting with Dr Daly. Julian was in fact then moved that very same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald put it to Blackwood that plainly Assange was moved to the medical wing for medical reasons. His evidence was wrong. Blackwood continued to assert Assange was moved only because of the video. Dr Daly’s medical notes did not say he was moved for medical reasons. The judge pulled up Fitzgerald for saying “nonsense”, although she had allowed Lewis to be much harder than that on defence witnesses. Fitzgerald asked Blackwood why Assange would be moved to the medical wing because of a video taken by another prisoner? Blackwood said the Governor had found the video “embarrassing” and was concerned about “reputational damage” to the prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us look at this. Dr Daly did not put in the medical notes that Assange had concealed a razor for suicide in his cell. Dr Daly did not put in the medical notes that, on the very day Assange was moved to the medical wing, a staff meeting had said he should be moved to the medical wing for uncontrollable suicidal urges. Then Daly gives Blackwood a cock and bull story on reasons for Assange’s removal to the medical wing, to assist him in his downplaying of Assange’s medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or let us look at the alternative story. The official story is that Healthcare – to quote Ross Kemp where “security is on another level” – is used for solitary confinement, to hold prisoners in isolation for entirely non-medical reasons. Indeed, to avoid “embarrassment”, to avoid “reputational damage”, Assange was kept in isolation in “healthcare” for months while, according to four doctors including on this point even Blackwood, his health deteriorated because of the isolation. While under Dr Daly’s “care”. And that one is the official story. The best they can come up with is “he was not sick, we put him in “Healthcare” for entirely illegitimate reasons as a punishment.” To avoid “embarrassment” if prisoners took his photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to write to Judge Baraitser applying for a copy of the transcript of Lewis cross-examining Professor Kopelman on the razor blade, with a view to reporting Lewis to the Bar Council. I do wonder whether the General Medical Council might not have reason to consider the practice of Dr Daly in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final witness was Dr Sondra Crosby, as the doctor who had been treating Julian since his time in the Ecuadorean Embassy. Dr Crosby seemed a wonderful person and while her evidence was very compelling, again I see no strong reason to reveal it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of Thursday’s proceedings, there were two witness statements read very quickly into the record. This was actually very important but passed almost unnoticed. John Young of cryptome.org gave evidence that Cryptome had published the unredacted cables on 1 September 2011, crucially the day before Wikileaks published them. Cryptome is US based but they had never been approached by law enforcement about these unredacted cables in any way nor asked to take them down. The cables remained online on Cryptome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly Chris Butler, Manager for Internet Archive, gave evidence of the unredacted cables and other classified documents being available on the Wayback machine. They had never been asked to take down nor been threatened with prosecution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Forgive me for pointing out that my ability to provide this coverage is entirely dependent on your kind voluntary subscriptions which keep this blog going.

<og:title>Your Man in the Public Gallery: Assange Hearing Day 17 - Craig Murray</og:title>
<og:description>During the hearing of medical evidence the last three days, the British government has been caught twice directly telling important lies about events in Belmarsh prison, each lie proven by documentary evidence. The common factor has been the medical records kept by Dr Daly, head of the jail’s medical services. There has also been, to […]</og:description>
