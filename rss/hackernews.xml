<title>Bezos Investigation Finds the Saudis Obtained His Private Data</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, I’ve advised at-risk public figures and government agencies on high-stakes security matters. My career has included working with the CIA, FBI, at the Reagan White House, counseling foreign leaders, and advising on controversial murder cases. I’ve seen a lot. And yet, I’ve recently seen things that have surprised even me, such as the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company, AMI, being in league with a foreign nation that’s been actively trying to harm American citizens and companies, including the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. You know him as Jeff Bezos; I know him as my client of 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand where this story goes, some background is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; published a special edition that revealed an intimate relationship Bezos was having. He asked me to learn who provided his private texts to the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, and why. My office quickly identified the person whom the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; had paid as a source: a man named &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7&quot;&gt;Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, the now-estranged brother of Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos was dating. What was unusual, very unusual, was how hard AMI people worked to publicly reveal their source’s identity. First through strong hints they gave to me, and later through direct statements, AMI practically pinned a “kick me” sign on Michael Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not the White House, it was not Saudi Arabia,” a company lawyer said on national television, before telling us more: “It was a person that was known to both Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” In case even more was needed, he added, “Any investigator that was going to investigate this knew who the source was,” a very helpful hint since the name of who was being investigated had been made public 10 days earlier in a &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe&quot;&gt;Daily Beast report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much was made about a recent front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, fingering Michael Sanchez as the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; source—but that information was first published almost seven weeks ago by The Daily Beast, after “multiple sources inside AMI” told The Beast the exact same thing.  The actual news in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; article was that its reporters were able to confirm a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/brother-of-jeff-bezos-girlfriend-admits-a-deal-with-national-enquirer&quot;&gt;claim Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; had been making: It was &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; who first contacted Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; about the affair, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMI has repeatedly &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/business/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-amazon-hollywood.html&quot;&gt;insisted they had only one source&lt;/a&gt; on their Bezos story, but the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; began conversations with Michael Sanchez, they had “already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.” Michael Sanchez has since confirmed to Page Six that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; contacted him back in July, they had already “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2019/03/30/this-was-real-lauren-sanchezs-brother-tells-all-on-bezos-romance/?_ga=2.164107583.1694089182.1553909345-326982824.1534253864&quot;&gt;seen text exchanges&lt;/a&gt;” between the couple. If accurate, the WSJ and Page Six stories would mean, clearly and obviously, that &lt;em&gt;the initial information came from other channels—another source or method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bezos directed me to ‘spend whatever is needed’ to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it. That investigation is now complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is complicated, and can’t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like “the brother did it,” even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid, and even when that brother is an associate of Roger Stone and Carter Page. Though interesting, it turns out those truths are also too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did AMI’s people work so hard to identify a source, and insist to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and others that he was their sole source for everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best answer is contained in what happened next: AMI threatened to publish embarrassing photos of Jeff Bezos unless certain conditions were met. (These were photos that, for some reason, they had held back and not published in their first story on the Bezos affair, or any subsequent story.)  While a brief summary of those terms has been made public before, others that I’m sharing are new—and they reveal a great deal about what was motivating AMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eight-page contract AMI sent for me and Bezos to sign would have required that I make a public statement, composed by them and then widely disseminated, saying that my investigation had concluded they hadn’t relied upon “any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note here that I’d never publicly said anything about electronic eavesdropping or hacking—and they wanted to be sure I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also wanted me to say our investigation had concluded that their Bezos story was not “instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.” External forces? Such a strange phrase. AMI knew these statements did not reflect my conclusions, because I told AMI’s Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard (in a 90-minute recorded phone call) that what they were asking me to say about external forces and hacking “is not my truth,” and would be “just echoing what you are looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Indeed, an earlier set of their proposed terms included AMI making a statement “affirming that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct” – but now they wanted me to say that for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract further held that if Bezos or I were ever in our lives to “state, suggest or allude to” anything contrary to what AMI wanted said about electronic eavesdropping and hacking, then they could publish the embarrassing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this today because it’s exactly what the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; scheme was intended to prevent me from doing. Their contract also contained terms that would have inhibited both me and Bezos from initiating a report to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn’t work out as they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the terms for avoiding publication of personal photos were presented to Jeff Bezos, he responded immediately: “No thank you.” Within hours, he wrote an essay describing his reasons for rejecting AMI’s threatening proposal. Then he &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f&quot;&gt;posted it all on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, including AMI’s actual emails and their salacious descriptions of private photos. (After the Medium post, AMI put out a limp statement saying it “believed fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues Bezos raised in his Medium post have nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Sanchez, any more than revealing the name of a low-level Watergate burglar sheds light on the architects of the Watergate cover-up. Bezos was not expressing concerns about the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; original story; he was focused on what he called “extortion and blackmail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Bezos directed me to “spend whatever is needed” to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investigation is now complete. As has &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7&quot;&gt;been reported elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, my results have been turned over to federal officials. Since it is now out of my hands, I intend today’s writing to be my last public statement on the matter. Further, to respect officials pursuing this case, I won’t disclose details from our investigation. I am, however, comfortable confirming one key fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information. As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not reach our conclusions lightly. The inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cyber security experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (also known as MBS), people who work with his close associate Saud al-Qahtani, Saudi dissidents, and other targets of Saudi action, including writer/activist &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.arabtyrantmanual.com/&quot;&gt;Iyad el-Baghdadi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts with whom we consulted confirmed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports on the Saudi capability to “collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace—including phone calls, texts, emails”—and confirmed that hacking was a key part of the Saudi’s “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html&quot;&gt;extensive surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately led to the killing of [&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;] journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been very intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi campaign against Bezos has already been reported by &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business&quot;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg, &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-saudis-made-jeff-bezos-public-enemy-1&quot;&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia attacks people in many ways, obviously, including through their &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;elaborate social media program&lt;/a&gt; that uses sophisticated technology and paid surrogates to create artificially trending hashtags. To give you an idea of how this program has infected the U.S., the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the Saudis &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;even had an operative inside Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which fired the suspect employee, and later advised select activists and others that “your Twitter account is one of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-sponsored actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the Saudi government &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business/video/playlists/business-jeff-bezos/&quot;&gt;unleashed its cyber army&lt;/a&gt; on Bezos (and later me). Their multi-pronged campaign included public calls for boycotts against Amazon.com and its Saudi subsidiary, Souq.com. Just three examples among thousands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;10.861016949153&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Mobiledoc&quot; readability=&quot;17.196610169492&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We as Saudis will never accept to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aadelljaber/status/1059178591567728640&quot;&gt;attacked by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, only to buy products from Amazon and Souq.com by night! Strange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our weapon is to boycott… because the owner of the newspaper is the same as their owner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yhya_jaber/status/1065352725750259712&quot;&gt;We're after you - the Jew&lt;/a&gt;, worshipper of money, will go bankrupt by the will of God at the hands of Saudi Arabia... the owner of Amazon and Souq is the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is the spiteful Jew who insults us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos is not Jewish, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the well-documented and close relationship between MBS and AMI chairman, David Pecker. That alliance includes David Pecker &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/media/david-pecker-trump-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;bringing MBS intermediary&lt;/a&gt; Kacy Grine to a private White House meeting with President Trump and Jared Kushner. Mr. Pecker has also traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince. Though we don’t know what was discussed in those private meetings, AMI’s actions afterwards are telling. To coincide with MBS’ March 2018 U.S. tour, AMI created a 100-page, ad-free, glossy magazine called &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-publisher-pal-puts-saudi-propaganda-magazine-in-us-supermarkets&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since MBS wasn’t yet a notorious figure in the West (this was before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi), AMI’s magazine introduced him to Americans as “the most influential Arab leader—transforming the world at 32,” and “improving lives of his people &amp;amp; hopes for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press reported that AMI sent &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;an advance digital copy&lt;/a&gt; of their laudatory magazine to the Saudi Embassy three weeks before printing and distributing 200,000 issues. (Despite AP’s substantial forensic evidence, the kingdom denied it received the magazine’s content in advance. While we’re on denials, the kingdom says Saudi Arabia had nothing to with the Bezos matter. The kingdom also says MBS had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When AMI publicly insisted that nobody outside of their executives and editors “had any influence on this publication or its content,” I guess they meant other than Kacy Grine, the very same MBS-intermediary Pecker had brought to The White House. I say that because AMI soon had to disclose to the Department of Justice National Security Division that their mystery magazine included content written by Grine, and that they also gave him the whole working draft for advance review, and that he suggested changes, and that they implemented his changes, and that he provided better photographs of MBS. With friends like AMI, you don’t need… publicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My firm has done many investigations into &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misconduct, including one that became the subject of a &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-29/entertainment/ca-1145_1_national-enquirer&quot;&gt;investigative piece&lt;/a&gt; way back in 1990.  Before then, tabloids had been seen as almost funny publications, mixing celebrity gossip with space aliens and Elvis sightings. But when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; on-again-off-again relationship with the truth percolated into politics, it wasn’t so funny anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though relatively benign at first (“Al Gore’s Diet Is Making Him Stupid”), the Trump/Pecker relationship has metastasized: In effect, the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/national-enquirer-trump-mistresses.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; became an enforcement arm&lt;/a&gt; of the Trump presidential campaign, and presidency, as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York laid out in its case against Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty. The U.S. Attorney has done the country a service by levying extensive controls on AMI, David Pecker, and his deputy Dylan Howard, through a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1119501/download&quot;&gt;non-prosecution agreement&lt;/a&gt; that requires them to commit no other crimes for three years, and requires everyone at AMI to attend annual training on federal election laws. I’m guessing that’s not how they used to spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be wrong to imply that the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t evolved since the 90s, because it has. The tabloid and its chairman have evolved into &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;secretly entangling with a nation-state&lt;/a&gt; that’s using its enormous resources to harm American citizens and companies. And now they’ve evolved into trying to strong-arm an American citizen whom that country’s leadership wanted harmed, compromised, and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Saudi side of the equation: Not only does the kingdom have a close alliance with AMI—which owns the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt;, Radar Online, and many other publications—but the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/saudi-arabia-hollywood-media-deals-where-they-stand-jamal-khashoggi/&quot;&gt;Saudis have pursued investments&lt;/a&gt; and partnerships involving &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the Robb Report&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike these publications, it’s clear that MBS considers the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; to be a major enemy. Saudi Arabia is hardly the first repressive regime that seeks total control of the news media in its own country. Wanting to control the media in the United States—and using any means to do so—will hopefully prove to be an overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coc is an intellisense engine for vim8 &amp;amp; neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works on &lt;code&gt;vim &amp;gt;= 8.1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;neovim &amp;gt;= 0.3.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a completion framework and language server client which supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;extension features of VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/54332743-a32ac180-465a-11e9-9d8e-a00786bcb833.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/54332743-a32ac180-465a-11e9-9d8e-a00786bcb833.gif&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;201&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True snippet and additional text edit support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floating window requires master of neovim to work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/F.A.Q#how-to-make-preview-window-shown-aside-with-pum&quot;&gt;follow the steps in the faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/blob/master/doc/coc.txt&quot;&gt;doc/coc.txt&lt;/a&gt; for vim interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completion experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why yet another completion engine since there is the already widely used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim&quot;&gt;deoplete.nvim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the reasons that led coc.nvim to build it's own engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full LSP completion support&lt;/strong&gt;, especially snippet and &lt;code&gt;additionalTextEdit&lt;/code&gt; feature, you'll understand why it's awesome when you experience it with coc extension like &lt;code&gt;coc-tsserver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous and parallel completion request&lt;/strong&gt;, unless using vim sources, your vim will never blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does completion resolve on completion item change&lt;/strong&gt;. The detail from complete item is echoed after selected, this feature requires the &lt;code&gt;MenuPopupChanged&lt;/code&gt; autocmd to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete request and cancel request support&lt;/strong&gt;, only incomplete complete request would be triggered on filter complete items and cancellation request is send to servers when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start completion without timer&lt;/strong&gt;. The completion will start after you type the first letter of a word by default and is filtered with new input after the completion has finished. Other completion engines use a timer to trigger completion so you always have to wait after the typed character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realtime buffer keywords&lt;/strong&gt;. Coc will generate buffer keywords on buffer change in background (with debounce), while some completion engines use a cache which could be wrong sometimes. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_locality-bonus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Locality bonus feature&lt;/a&gt; from VSCode is enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter completion items when possible.&lt;/strong&gt; When you do a fuzzy filter with completion items, some completion engines would trigger a new completion, but coc.nvim will filter the items when possible which makes it much faster. Filtering completion items on backspace is also supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Table of contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug&quot;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/a&gt; user. Add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-viml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Plug &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;neoclide/coc.nvim&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, {&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;do&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;coc#util#install&lt;/span&gt;()}}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or build from source code by install &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nodejs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl -sL install-node.now.sh/lts &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sh
curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-viml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Plug &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;neoclide/coc.nvim&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, {&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;do&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;yarn install --frozen-lockfile&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to your &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;init.vim&lt;/code&gt;, restart vim and run &lt;code&gt;:PlugInstall&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other plugin managers, run command &lt;code&gt;:call coc#util#build()&lt;/code&gt; to build coc from source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; for vim users, global installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/vim-node-rpc&quot;&gt;vim-node-rpc&lt;/a&gt; module is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; to build from master, don't use &lt;code&gt;'tag': '*'&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Plug&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The first time building from source code could be slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Nix-os Users must follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nodejs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;nix-env&lt;/code&gt; or put them on &lt;code&gt;/etc/nixos/configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'tag': '*', 'do': 'yarn install'}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't forget to put: &lt;code&gt;set shell=/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; in your init.vim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Completion sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion from words of buffers and file paths are supported by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other completion sources, check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Create-custom-source&quot;&gt;create custom source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions are powerful than configured language server. Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;Using coc extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more, to get a full list of coc extensions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Acoc.nvim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search coc.nvim on npm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;code&gt;:CocConfig&lt;/code&gt; to edit the configuration file, auto completion is supported after &lt;code&gt;coc-json&lt;/code&gt; has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example vim configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-viml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; if hidden is not set, TextEdit might fail.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Better display for messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cmdheight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Smaller updatetime for CursorHold &amp;amp; CursorHoldI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;updatetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;shortmess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; always show signcolumns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;signcolumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;yes

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use tab for trigger completion with characters ahead and navigate.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use command ':verbose imap &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;' to make sure tab is not mapped by other plugin.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;inoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;silent&amp;gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pumvisible&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-n&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;check_back_space&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :

&lt;p&gt;There is a good reason people call Twitter the hell website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynicism, egos, unprovoked hostility, unchecked propaganda, sexism, bigotry, and outright hate—Twitter is as full of it as virtually anywhere online, and worse, it’s unbearably nonstop. The design of the place feels uniquely unhealthy due in large part to its speed and unrelenting stream. Opening up TweetDeck, the Twitter-owned client favored by maniacs like me thanks to its real-time updating feature, can seem like stepping into an oncoming tidal wave and getting swept out to sea. Before too long, you feel exhausted and ready to give up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have to be on Twitter due to our jobs, some of us just feel like we have to be. I’m here to offer a few ancient and unsexy alternatives to Twitter as life preservers. We’re doing a nautical theme today, by the way, I hope that’s cool with you. No reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, social media is water in our lungs (I’m sorry, I’m sorry, that’s the last one). With so many of us contemplating deleting our accounts or at least cutting down on that screen time, it’s time to reconsider something that feels lost in this era of algorithm-fueled newsfeeds and timelines: RSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is a family of technologies that give you a simple feed from a spot on the web—a news site, a podcast, a blog—into your RSS reader. It’s a timeline of sorts, yes, but it runs at a sane speed, and it stays in your control, unlike Facebook or Twitter’s unknowable whims, and it excludes the vast majority of toxic noise that characterizes so much of social media. Folks, RSS is still good. More than just good, RSS is better in many ways than Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invented exactly 20 years ago this month on the back-end of a feverish dot-com boom, RSS (Real Simple Syndication) has persisted as a technology despite Google’s infamous abandonment with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/google-reader-is-shutting-down-here-are-the-best-alter-5990456?tag=google-reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://lifehacker.com/google-reader-is-shutting-down-here-are-the-best-alter-5990456?tag=google-reader', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;death of Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; and Silicon Valley social media companies trying and succeeding to supplant it. In the six years since Google shut down Reader, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a million words&lt;/a&gt; written about the technology’s rise and apparent fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s important: RSS is very much still here. Better yet, RSS can be a healthy alternative when Twitter is making you feel like shit. In 2019, that’s, like, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Twitter’s main value proposition is that it delivers up-to-the-second news. Let’s just be honest with ourselves: 99 percent of the time, we don’t need up-to-the-second news. Most of us would do much better waiting until someone has had time to process the news and write more than 280 characters to explain in full what’s going on. Ideally, that happens on news websites themselves, which more often than not still offer RSS feeds. Gizmodo, for instance, is putting RSS out into the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/rss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/rss', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;at this very moment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS has the advantage of &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; slow without being slow. You can get an article in your RSS reader as soon as it’s been published—and how much faster are you really looking to go? What you don’t get is the flash flood of half-thoughts and hot takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I’m not going to pretend I have this abyssal hellscape figured out. I’m not performatively quitting Twitter, this is not a blog about a black-and-white solution requiring you to quit social media and live in a monastery, even though that sounds pretty great. It’s about an alternative to a tool that, after a while, can be a hindrance rather than a help—at least to my sanity. The idea of seeking out the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/find-comfort-on-the-slow-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.wired.com/story/find-comfort-on-the-slow-web/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;slow web&lt;/a&gt;” has been around for a long time. But there’s nothing wrong with wanting to get the latest news as it happens. It’s just a matter of striking the right balance, which RSS provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an easy process to start. First, choose an RSS reader. My two favorites are &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://feedly.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsblur.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.newsblur.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt;. I prefer NewsBlur because I like the iOS app more, but Feedly is very popular and good, so give either one a try. They both accomplish the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, find your feeds. I’d start with, at most, 10 news sites to subscribe to. This will give you a feel for how fast you want the feed to move. Too slow? Add more. To fast? Delete a few. I try to narrow things down even further: Instead of subscribing to the New York Times, which publishes dozens of items per day, I subscribe specifically to the Times’ tech section, which means I get a much more curated selection. For whichever site you want to subscribe to, you should be able to copy and paste the URL into your reader and subscribe from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If RSS alone doesn’t quite do it for you, there are other tools that make finding online content less soul-sucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complement to my RSS reader is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuzzel.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://nuzzel.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Nuzzel&lt;/a&gt; account. Like RSS, Nuzzel is years old, and it’s relatively slow. I cannot stress enough: Slow can be good. Nuzzel looks at your Twitter account and surfaces the stories being shared most within the last few hours or days—an easy way to parse through the headlines your follows think are most important without necessarily getting caught in the hair-trigger tweets that can make it a relentless cesspool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same realm of slow tech, there’s a “new” trend that’s actually older than RSS itself: The email newsletter. Everyone and their dad seem to have one these days, and there’s even a New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;trend piece&lt;/a&gt; on the whole phenomenon, which is how you know it’s already old and uncool as hell. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An email newsletter avoids most of the pitfalls of Twitter hell while still delivering on many of value points. If you’re on Twitter to dive into a specific world—tech, basketball, national security, make up, whatever—there’s almost certainly a good newsletter for it, whether it’s from a specific publication or a smart individual who wants to write and riff but who probably hates Twitter as much as the rest of us. Get the intelligence and links delivered to your inbox daily and then move on. No getting wiped out by the endless social media riptide. Oh, by the way, we’re back to nautical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For newsletters, you can do two things. First, your news websites and blogs of choice probably have newsletters that you can sign up for from the home page—which you probably already know thanks to the charming pop-ups that everyone uses because fuck you that’s why. Second, there are two startups behind many of today’s active newsletters: &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://substack.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/explore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.getrevue.co/explore', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Revue&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at both sites and see what interests you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we’re probably not going to be able to escape social media entirely. I couldn’t even if I wanted to since it’s part of my job, as it may be part of yours. For us poor souls—and those of you who are, for some reason, online all day by choice—know that it’s okay to slow down. You’re not missing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leveraging A Poor Memory In Engineering</title>
<link>https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was burned out and my software career was stalling just three years in. My memory sucked. Was my poor memory from stress, lack of sleep or was it always this bad? Work was a cycle of &quot;TODAY IS THE DAY I CHANGE&quot; and end in a self-loathing dopamine-addicted HackerNews, Reddit and Medium. I was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice I Needed But Ignored #213&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't tie your self-worth to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a good, hell, great software engineer. But my work was mediocre. Even worse, I was trying. My ass was in that chair twelve hours a day, six days a week trying to write beautiful Python code. I was constantly looking up documentation and sucked into the internet's rabbit-hole of distractions. I was a try-hard failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was Kyle. Kyle and I had started programming from scratch; we were both learning on the job. Three years later, our progress was nothing alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kyle is the first 10X engineer I have ever worked with.&quot; - Every. single. coworker. w/ 15+ years experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle worked weekdays from 10AM to 4PM. He got his work done early and single-handedly output 80% of the entire team. Adding more insult to injury, he only worked like 60% of the time. The rest of the time was spent on ... HackerNews, Reddit and Medium. I was the try-hard slow brute, and Kyle was the graceful hare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle didn't have a secret routine. He never meditated. He was skinny despite McDonalds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But, Kyle had a super hero ability. Photographic memory in API syntax and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted that and I was jealous. My career was stuck and something needed to change. And so I began a dedicated journey into spaced repetition. Every day for three years, I spent one to three hours in spaced repetition. It was brutal and I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Spaced Repetition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is a remembering technique that will remind you concepts at &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;spaced&lt;/span&gt; intervals to maximize memory retention efficiently. It's a strategy to remind our brains of facts; it exploits that the best time to be remember a fact is &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;3&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; before we forget it. Our brains are forgetful, but we can use strategies to make it less forgetful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/PQi7hTmXRcue4txkNTRp&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At increasing spacing intervals, memory is more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory (and less likely forgotten). Notice the duration of each reminder is further out every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/2HhUrUsSiqQl0WDPrwcL&quot; alt=&quot;forgetting_curve_2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This image represents exactly the same as above, but in different colors to promote retention. I'm full of brain hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend you had six chances in a year to remind Bill Gates your name. If Bill remembers your name a full calendar year later, you get a million dollars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which reminder interval would you pick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1 - Cram Before the Exam:&lt;/strong&gt; Dec 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2 - The Ivy League Valedictorian:&lt;/strong&gt; 1st of every other month. Jan 1st, March 1st, April 1st, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3 - Spaced Repetition:&lt;/strong&gt; January 1st, January 3rd, January 20th, Feb 28th, April 15th, September 30th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option 3 (Spaced Repetition) gives you the highest probability of Bill remembering your name. Ah, the Captain Obvious Blog Writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Why Option 3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cramming rarely works after it passes from short-term memory. How many cram sessions do you remember from high school?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evenly spaced reminders sort-of works, but you'd have to review all your knowledge at every interval, which doesn't sound scalable/fun/have a social life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our brains work best with exponentially spaced reminders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of medical students and language learning apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, spaced repetition isn't common. It's not as cool as cramming, but it works. Medical students use it to memorize those awful thousand page textbooks. Duolingo uses it because it's effective. Remember that guy dominating Jeopardy a few years ago? Spaced repetition fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it's so amazing, why isn't spaced repetition common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People don't know about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you use it, it's hard to make a habit of reviewing flashcards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making flashcards is annoying. Who wants to type notes into a flashcard app?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People take a big talk about self-improvement, but don't want to do no stinkin' hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not cool. You're not going to bringing up flashcard studying on your first date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But software engineers already have these pain points ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineers are expected to know about upcoming trends. Otherwise, you'd still be using BitBucket and Adobe Flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers are creatures of habit. Make reviewing your flashcard app your first work task (or the train, the toilet right before Candy Crush). Stop StackOverflowing &quot;how do i amend my git commit&quot; five times every month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using Quiver, EverNote, Notion, etc, for notetaking, save it as a flashcard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a good software engineer requires lifelong learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's be honest, you're not getting first dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supermemo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SuperMemo&lt;/a&gt; are the most common spaced repetition applications. Both help create flashcards and quiz based off an spacing algorithm. If you get a question right, it'll ask again further out. Get a card wrong? It'll remind you tomorrow. I use Anki. Anki seems more common among software engineers. Download the mobile app (iOS/Android). &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Android app is fantastic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick terminology (in case you forgot ...):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spaced repetition is a learning technique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki and SuperMemo are applications that will use spaced repetition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create flashcards in Anki and SuperMemo. They quiz you at spaced intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deck is commonly referred to as your entire flashcard collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Habit:&lt;/span&gt; Whenever I search StackOverflow, I'll immediately create a flashcard of my question and the answer(s) into Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/GJKR95RHQI6VsDjQ15Oe&quot; alt=&quot;anki_card_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;298&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Parameter about gsutil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/7wW4UFxS0KRctWNA8T12&quot; alt=&quot;anki_card_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy question I got wrong yesterday. I was almost too embarrassed to show this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is an offline poor man's StackOverflow (Yes, I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://kapeli.com/dash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;). Pre-Anki, I was forgetting syntax equivalent to my daily learnings. I was already using Anki for general knowledge. Why not embrace programming flashcards for Anki? I was hesitant because of a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laziness. Writing good Anki programming flashcards can be hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flashcards w/code is difficult to remember. It's much easier to remember the capital of Mongolia (Ulaanbaatar) than how to copy a list of files in a .txt file from an externally mounted hard drive using xargs (cat list.txt | xargs -l{} mv /Volumes/External/{} /Desktop). Getting a card wrong for multiple days is frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the last three years, I've added EVERYTHING to Anki. Bash aliases, IDE Shortcuts, programming APIs, documentation, design patterns, etc. Having done that, I wouldn't recommend adding EVERYTHING. That topic of my Anki mistakes deserves it's own article ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After embracing Anki, once I had mastered a card, the quick recall around language and framework APIs was like having my prayer to the flow gods finally being answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, my all-too common pattern was :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StackOverflow some syntax I frustratingly forgot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get distracted. Read HackerNews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hmm, nothing new on HackerNews, let's try Reddit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get into flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despair. Maybe someone posted a new story on HackerNews?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now equipped with an improved memory in API syntax, documentation, country capitals, and engineering — there's a stark difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2016 - Short Bursts Followed By Frustrating Distractions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.snag.gy/Z1lXxi.jpg&quot; width=&quot;755&quot; height=&quot;213&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current Year to Date - I Should Find A New Hobby ...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/YJAAIqRFmP6oU79lGWQ8&quot; alt=&quot;github_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;791&quot; height=&quot;223&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Commitment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spaced repetition requires a daily commitment, but guarantees a great memory. Most users average about twenty minutes a day reviewing. If you're adding zero additional cards (cough, slacker), your review time averages to zero as knowledge become long-term memory. The confidence of knowing that once something is added to Anki it won't be forgotten is &lt;strong&gt;intoxicating&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/8rt0jW5TSzucfjEsOeyM&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;871&quot; height=&quot;739&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaced repetition is my most important career/life-hack&lt;/strong&gt;. It's not always easy. It doesn't guarantee you'll be a better engineer (best practices and design beats syntax), but it'll make you a capable one. When you can quickly recall syntax, you'll be amazed at how fast you can code. Sometimes that just results in shitty code, faster. &lt;strong&gt;But the best coders code a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. And that's the only guaranteed way to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge compounds in interesting ways. Many of my flashcards include blogs and articles about engineering — knowing the history of RPC, SOAP, REST and GraphQL has lead to improved design and architecture decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Counter&lt;/strong&gt;: Memorizing binary search tree algorithms has yet to come in handy ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing 10X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this by chasing an absurd dream of &quot;becoming a 10X engineer&quot;. Like there would be a graduation ceremony or something ridiculous. On second thought, the &quot;Biggest Tool of the Year&quot; award sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what constitutes a 10X engineer; we don't have benchmarks that encompass output, leadership, code quality and technical debt. Chasing 10X became meaningless when I finally had the confidence that I was shaping my own self-improvement. An improved memory gave me control of my own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle is still multiples better than I will ever be, and that's perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice I Needed But Ignored #421&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't compare yourself to others. Just make sure you're improving everyday. Compound interest is the most powerful thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>The Programming Language Conundrum</title>
<link>http://evrl.com/programming/2019/03/28/the-language-conundrum.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://evrl.com/programming/2019/03/28/the-language-conundrum.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about “hyperproductive teams”, and a lot has been written how programming languages help here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;&gt;Beating the Averages&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most famous one. I myself worked in Smalltalk full-time, and can share the same kind of story. So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I created my own startup, an Internet hosting company, I went down the same path as Paul Graham: two coders, me and a full time one, a VisualWorks Smalltalk license, and we managed to develop something that was utterly impressive given that we had 1.5FTE on the job. Hosting provisioning, accounting, all sorts of really advanced stuff around whole-sale packaging, multiple currencies, and so on. Later on, I worked at a larger Smalltalk shop and between 5-6 developers we completely beat large companies employing ten times as many people. So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can recite many of such stories; of people keeping up with their ten person team by coding whatever the team did during the day in 2-3 hours at night using Squeak Smalltalk; about an old Lisp hacker working in a research setup with mostly Java colleagues and always estimating to need 10% of the time (and then actually making the estimate). So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is multifaceted, of course. There’s a fear, often more with management than actual techies, of choosing a non mainstream language because hiring for that language will be too hard (wrong). Tooling for niche languages often is not as good as for mainstream stuff (quick, find a way to deploy a Pharo Smalltalk image on EC2 or in a container). The list goes on and on and usually every point can receive the same reaction: yes, that might be true, but if the payoff is that big, why not make the investment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s one thing in common between all the stories I’ve heard and the successes experienced first hand: small teams. Every single time, you are looking at a software development shop with a grand total of, say, less than a dozen developers in a pretty stable setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, I think, is the only way to use these very powerful languages (and do not forget: they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that powerful). Because, each in its own way, these languages encourage you to solve your problem in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a language to solve your problem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve your problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisp is more explicit about this, but I opened an old Smalltalk image and the “application” language ended up being very high level, very domain specific, and just as hard to grok as your average macro-ridden Lisp system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These languages are very powerful, but they don’t scale. So even when you get ten times the productivity, the mostly tribal complexity will not scale beyond your “pizza-sized team” and therefore you now have a hard upper limit on your total software development capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harsh, isn’t it? But I cannot find counterexamples. Whereas I can find plenty of examples of teams using “normal” programming languages (Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, or newer entrants like Elixir or even Golang) that breeze through the 100, 200, 500 developer marks without much trouble. So I must conclude that there seems to be a scaling limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? My theory, completely made up and untested, is that these powerful Lisp/Smalltalk systems weave code and brains together in a way that amplifies both. It’s very organic, very hard to document, and thus it becomes very hard to absorb new brains into the system. When I joined the small Smalltalk group it was very hard to get started in that codebase. It was complex, and completely different from the previous thing I worked on. Both were using the same VM (VisualWorks) but both had their IDEs adapted to a point that they became new and very well-honed tools and new things in their own right. In Smalltalk, there’s no difference between writing “business” code and writing “tooling” code, and even no difference between that and changing your IDE, so everything happens interchangeably and fluidly and you end up with an IDE that’s adapted for the problem at hand, not for everybody’s generic problems. It’s hard to ramp-up in these environments and certainly in the light of the short retention times these days, likely won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that terrible disappointment… I think I’ll end while hoping that someone out there on planet Earth reads this and proves me wrong :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;IPPOCRATES, GALEN&lt;/small&gt;, Avicenna and other ancient physicians frequently used odour as a diagnostic tool. Although scent is not used nearly as often in modern medicine, it still has its place. Paramedics are routinely taught to spot the fruity smell on the breath of diabetics who have become hyperglycaemic and gastroenterologists are trained to detect the odour of digested blood. But there has been scant evidence of a smell associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Now one has been found for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently causing tremors, rigidity and dementia, Parkinson’s is both debilitating and substantially shortens life expectancy. The rate at which these symptoms appear and worsen cannot be stopped or slowed yet but its most harmful effects can be staved off with drugs. As with many diseases, the earlier the intervention, the better. Yet herein lies one of the greatest challenges—there are no tests that diagnose whether Parkinson’s is actually present. The best that neurologists can do is study the symptoms and theorise about whether someone actually has the disease. Hence the search is on for a better form of diagnosis. Unexpectedly, scientists are now literally following someone’s nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy Milne, a retired nurse from Perth, Scotland has an extraordinary sense of smell. Known as hyperosmia, Mrs Milne’s condition allows her to detect odours that are imperceptible to most people. In 1974 Mrs Milne noticed an odd musky smell around her house that had not been present before. In 1986, her husband, Les Milne, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. He lived with the disease for a number of years and while the symptoms were initially manageable with medication, this became harder over time. Eventually, he was forced to retire and, while attending Parkinson’s support groups, Mrs Milne noted something extraordinary. Everyone with the disease had the same distinctive odour that her husband had developed in 1974. It was shortly after that realisation that she started collaborating with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Musky odour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing Mrs Milne with shirts worn by Parkinson’s patients, researchers found she was able to identify that the smell was concentrated along the upper back, and not in armpits as previously assumed. Most remarkably, of the control subjects without the disease, Mrs Milne found one to have the musky odour. Nine months later that person was diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this led Perdita Barran of the University of Manchester, in Britain, to set out to discover what was producing the telltale odour that Mrs Milne could detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work found that patients with Parkinson’s had a tendency to overproduce a waxy compound on the skin of their upper backs. Known as sebum, Dr Barran speculated that something trapped within this compound was producing the odour. Keen to find out, Dr Barran and her colleagues set up an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analysed sebum samples from 43 people suffering from Parkinson’s and 21 who were not. The sebum samples were collected on gauze and warmed to release any volatile compounds that might be found within them. Mass spectrometry and gas chromatography were then used to identify whether there were volatiles present and what they were. For a subset of the patient samples, Mrs Milne smelled the compounds before they entered the mass spectrometer and pressed a button when the distinctive odour was present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Barran reports in &lt;small&gt;ACS&lt;/small&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Central Science&lt;/em&gt;, the mass spectrometer identified four compounds, perillic aldehyde, hippuric acid, eicosane and octadecanal, in the vaporised sebum of the Parkinson’s disease patients that were at entirely different levels to those in the healthy group. To test whether these different levels of compounds were generating the smell that Mrs Milne was detecting, Dr Barran presented them to her and confirmed that they were, indeed, responsible for the musky odour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While relatively small in size, Dr Barran’s experiment is the first to reveal the specific compounds that generate the unique smell of Parkinson’s. Assuming larger follow-up experiments replicate her findings, the work paves the way for the development of a device, a sort of electronic nose, that could sniff the upper backs of patients to quickly determine who has the disease and who does not. That would allow drugs to help mitigate the symptoms to be administered all the sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Finally Killed AirPower</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/14883/what-finally-killed-airpower/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/14883/what-finally-killed-airpower/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a surprising turn of events, Apple has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cancelled its long-awaited AirPower wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The company says the product didn’t meet its “high standards,” but wasn’t specific as to why. We’ve been watching this space carefully and have an informed guess as to what happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was first introduced to the public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/12/apple-airpower-wireless-charging/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;in September of 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;during Apple’s iPhone X reveal. The company promised a single wireless charging mat that could charge three devices at the same time, like your iPhone, Apple Watch, and your AirPods (the last of which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;got wireless charging capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple planned on releasing AirPower the year after the iPhone X, in 2018. However, it was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/apples-airpower-charging-mat-delayed-until-fall-due-to-technical-hurdles/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly hit with numerous delays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And as 2018 dragged on, the speculation of its cancellation loomed large, especially after Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-scrubs-most-references-to-airpower-from-its-website/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;completely wiped its website clean of any mention of the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a full year after its announcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting in 2019, though, a glimmer of hope emerged:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chargerlab/status/1083952811887357952&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rumors surfaced that AirPower’s production was ramping up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pointing to the possibility that this product would finally be close to shipping. So close, in fact, that an iOS 12.2 beta—released just ten days before the AirPower’s cancellation—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/19/latest-ios-12-2-beta-includes-support-for-airpower-charging-mat-as-release-appears-imminent/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;included official support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the now-defunct wireless charger. And the second-generation AirPods even have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471#s233841&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an illustration of the wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the back of the box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/AqHaCKHPMGQWZ6u4&quot; width=&quot;6212&quot; height=&quot;3036&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was cancelled a mere nine days later, making us wonder what must have happened. After all, there are plenty of wireless charging mats on the market that can charge multiple devices at the same time. But unlike those mats (which are really just three separate chargers next to each other in the same unit), Apple wanted to take things to the next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With that said, we have a theory as to why Apple’s wireless charger fell completely flat during its last-second Hail Mary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overheating and Interference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wireless charging pads use electromagnetic induction to juice up your phone. Both the pad and your phone contain wire coils: the pad draws current from the wall and runs it through the coil, creating an electromagnetic field. That field induces an electric current in your phone’s wire coil, which it uses to charge the battery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the electricity being transmitted to your phone isn’t perfectly clean or ideal. It generates some noise, which can interfere with other wireless devices. That’s why the FCC (and regulatory bodies in other countries) set strict limits on wireless emissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Noise from a single coil might not be a problem, but each charging coil generates a slightly different waveform. When those waves overlap, the constructive interference intensifies their strength. Just like when two ocean waves collide and combine their height, radio frequencies can combine their intensity as they interact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Managing these overlapping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;harmonic frequencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is incredibly challenging, and gets harder the more coils that you are integrating. From patent filings, it looks like Apple’s ambitious plan was to use considerably more coils than other charging pads on the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ZeVIYex5sbywgEnk&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rumors speculated that Apple was considering up to 32 coils—up from the fifteen shown in their conceptual patent filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other multi-device wireless chargers place two or three coils side-by-side, but require you to fiddle with your phone to find the “sweet spot” over one coil for it to start charging. With AirPower, Apple was trying to create one large charging surface using overlapping coils, allowing it to power multiple devices from anywhere on the mat. But that introduces multiple challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We asked an engineer with experience building wireless charging systems what obstacles Apple was working to overcome. “Over time, these harmonics add up and they become really powerful signals in the air,” explains William Lumpkins, VP of Engineering at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ons-services.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;O &amp;amp; S Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “And that can be difficult—that can stop someone’s pacemaker if it’s too high of a level. Or it could short circuit someone’s hearing aid.” If Apple’s multi-coil layout was spinning off harmonics left and right, it’s possible AirPower couldn’t pass muster with US or EU regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of what’s astonishing about the AirPower cancellation is how last-minute it was, right on the heels of the AirPods 2 release. But Lumpkins says that happens sometimes. He speculated that Apple had AirPower working in their labs: ”Well, so what always happens is you get it functional first. No one looks at [Electro-Magnetic Interference] until the end.” The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fccid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FCC-Wireless-Charging-Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FCC rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for wireless charging devices like AirPower are quite strict, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/1.1310&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;limit exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at 20 cm (8 in) above the device to 50 mW/cm^2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869072/apple-airpower-overheating-issues&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rumors have circulated for months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about AirPower’s overheating issues, which would click nicely into place with this theory. In order to power multiple devices through a large array of coils, they would need a significant amount of power. “Overheating means they’re putting too much current into it, which means they’re trying to up the power level,” says Lumpkins. “My guess is they’re trying to pump out so much of a field, which is getting it to overheat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple boxed themselves into an electromagnetic corner. What they wanted to do was physically possible—and they surely had it working in the lab—but they couldn’t consistently meet the rigorous transmission requirements that are designed to keep us safe from our gadgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook &amp;#039;mistakenly deleted&amp;#039; years of Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#039;s old Facebook posts</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-old-posts-mark-zuckerberg-disappeared-2019-3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-old-posts-mark-zuckerberg-disappeared-2019-3</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Old Facebook posts by Mark Zuckerberg have disappeared — obscuring details about core moments in Facebook's history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On multiple occassions, years-old public posts made by the 34-year-old billionaire chief executive that were previously public and reported on by news outlets at the time have since vanished, Business Insider has found. That includes all of the posts he made during 2007 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson said the posts were &quot;mistakenly deleted&quot; due to &quot;technical errors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;A few years ago some of Mark's posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn't do it,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we've shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network's historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn't know how many posts in total were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The curious case of Mark Zuckerberg's vanishing Facebook posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In April 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram — a now-pivotal moment in the growth of the Menlo Park, California technology giant. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-instagram-features/&quot;&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-acquires-instagram-for-a-reported-one-billion-dollars-9637&quot;&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; from the time quoted from a public post that Zuckerberg made on his timeline about the acquisition — but that post now inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991&quot;&gt;The links to that post from old news articles&lt;/a&gt; no longer work, and it's nowhere to be seen on his profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was an important document in the history of Facebook, particularly given &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-acquires-instagram-for-a-reported-one-billion-dollars-9637&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg promised that&lt;/a&gt; &quot;we're committed to building and growing Instagram independently&quot; — a commitment he has since walked back. Facebook is now integrating the photo-sharing app into itself ever-more closely, and tensions around this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45635736&quot;&gt;contributed to the departure of Instagram's two cofounders in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;. (A copy of Zuckerbrerg's post has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2012/04/facebook-to-acquire-instagram/&quot;&gt;preserved in Facebook's Newsroom blog&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-exec-andrew-boz-bosworth-broke-rule-real-name-2019-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook exec Andrew Bosworth broke the social network's rule on using your real name for 8 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;This is the error message you see when you click on a link to one of Mark Zuckerberg's vanished Facebook posts. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another, specific example from later on: Facebook's beloved head chef Josef Desimone died in a motorcycle crash in July 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/22/josef-desimone/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch reported at the time that&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg shared the news &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100895107738711&quot;&gt;in a post on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. However, that post is now inaccessible as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook would go on to throw a party in Desimone's memory at its headquarters the following month. Hundreds of people were invited, and booze flowed freely — and it subsequently descended into chaos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-2013-memorial-party-chef-violence-gangs-2019-3&quot;&gt;As Business Insider previously reported, multiple fights broke out among attendees&lt;/a&gt;, which security staff believed were gang-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Numerous other posts by Zuckerberg from these time periods remain publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook has also made it harder to navigate its archives of old announcements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lastly, there have been issues accessing Facebook's archive of older blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In years past, Facebook had a dedicated blog that announcements would often be posted to and which was navigable by month; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090618174214/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;an archived example of a post is available here, via the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2014, Facebook launched its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Newsroom,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; a repository for its key announcements, and broke the public links to old blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn't have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there's no easy way to access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;They &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still exist in one form — as a &quot;note&quot; saved to Facebook's public &quot;Facebook&quot; page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page's thousands of posts over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After Business Insider reached out for comment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebook/notes/?ref=page_internal&quot;&gt;Facebook added a public &quot;notes&quot; tab to the Facebook page to access them&lt;/a&gt;. (A Facebook spokesperson said that the Notes tab should have been available since 2014, but &quot;a bug&quot; meant it wasn't viewable. Business Insider tried to find it prior to publication but encountered page-unavailable error messages.) As of press time, however, the notes tab was loading extremely slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/catalina-facebook-bird-sized-drones-connectivity-data-2019-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook secretly explored building bird-size drones to ferry data to people with bad internet connections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take, for example, the 2006 launch of the News Feed, which is now an advertising juggernaut that now makes billions of dollars for the company. Zuckerberg tried to quash early user backlash against the News Feed with a blog post called &quot;Calm down. Breathe. We hear you,&quot; but &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;a link to it&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/06/facebook-users-revolt-facebook-replies/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch news report from the time&lt;/a&gt; now just redirects to the Newsroom homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There's no copy of the blog post in the Newsroom, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/calm-down-breathe-we-hear-you/2208197130/&quot;&gt;it's currently only available as a note from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090618174214/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;Here's how it looked prior to the closure of the blog&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook's historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg's content has gone AWOL before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This isn't the first time Zuckerberg-related material has disappeared without warning from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In April 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch reported that messages sent by the CEO were being deleted from other people's inboxes&lt;/a&gt; without their knowledge or consent — a feature that wasn't available to ordinary Facebook users at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And back in November 2016, public posts from Zuckerberg about the media and Facebook's role in the 2016 US election also disappeared, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13777018/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election-post-disappeared&quot;&gt;The Verge reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the time, a spokesperson told the Verge that their removal was an accident and subsequently restored them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, on a certain evening about sixty-­six million years ago, you had stood somewhere in North America and looked up at the sky, you would have soon made out what appeared to be a star. If you watched for an hour or two, the star would have seemed to grow in brightness, although it barely moved. That’s because it was not a star but an asteroid, and it was headed directly for Earth at about forty-five thousand miles an hour. Sixty hours later, the asteroid hit. The air in front was compressed and violently heated, and it blasted a hole through the atmosphere, generating a supersonic shock wave. The asteroid struck a shallow sea where the Yucatán peninsula is today. In that moment, the Cretaceous period ended and the Paleogene period began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory used what was then one of the world’s most powerful computers, the so-called Q Machine, to model the effects of the impact. The result was a slow-motion, second-by-second false-color video of the event. Within two minutes of slamming into Earth, the asteroid, which was at least six miles wide, had gouged a crater about eighteen miles deep and lofted twenty-five trillion metric tons of debris into the atmosphere. Picture the splash of a pebble falling into pond water, but on a planetary scale. When Earth’s crust rebounded, a peak higher than Mt. Everest briefly rose up. The energy released was more than that of a billion Hiroshima bombs, but the blast looked nothing like a nuclear explosion, with its signature mushroom cloud. Instead, the initial blowout formed a “rooster tail,” a gigantic jet of molten material, which exited the atmosphere, some of it fanning out over North America. Much of the material was several times hotter than the surface of the sun, and it set fire to everything within a thousand miles. In addition, an inverted cone of liquefied, superheated rock rose, spread outward as countless red-hot blobs of glass, called tektites, and blanketed the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ejecta escaped Earth’s gravitational pull and went into irregular orbits around the sun. Over millions of years, bits of it found their way to other planets and moons in the solar system. Mars was eventually strewn with the debris—just as pieces of Mars, knocked aloft by ancient asteroid impacts, have been found on Earth. A 2013 study in the journal &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Astrobiology&lt;/em&gt; estimated that tens of thousands of pounds of impact rubble may have landed on Titan, a moon of Saturn, and on Europa and Callisto, which orbit Jupiter—three satellites that scientists believe may have promising habitats for life. Mathematical models indicate that at least some of this vagabond debris still harbored living microbes. The asteroid may have sown life throughout the solar system, even as it ravaged life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroid was vaporized on impact. Its substance, mingling with vaporized Earth rock, formed a fiery plume, which reached halfway to the moon before collapsing in a pillar of incandescent dust. Computer models suggest that the atmosphere within fifteen hundred miles of ground zero became red hot from the debris storm, triggering gigantic forest fires. As the Earth rotated, the airborne material converged at the opposite side of the planet, where it fell and set fire to the entire Indian subcontinent. Measurements of the layer of ash and soot that eventually coated the Earth indicate that fires consumed about seventy per cent of the world’s forests. Meanwhile, giant tsunamis resulting from the impact churned across the Gulf of Mexico, tearing up coastlines, sometimes peeling up hundreds of feet of rock, pushing debris inland and then sucking it back out into deep water, leaving jumbled deposits that oilmen sometimes encounter in the course of deep-sea drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage had only begun. Scientists still debate many of the details, which are derived from the computer models, and from field studies of the debris layer, knowledge of extinction rates, fossils and microfossils, and many other clues. But the over-all view is consistently grim. The dust and soot from the impact and the conflagrations prevented all sunlight from reaching the planet’s surface for months. Photosynthesis all but stopped, killing most of the plant life, extinguishing the phytoplankton in the oceans, and causing the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere to plummet. After the fires died down, Earth plunged into a period of cold, perhaps even a deep freeze. Earth’s two essential food chains, in the sea and on land, collapsed. About seventy-five per cent of all species went extinct. More than 99.9999 per cent of all living organisms on Earth died, and the carbon cycle came to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth itself became toxic. When the asteroid struck, it vaporized layers of limestone, releasing into the atmosphere a trillion tons of carbon dioxide, ten billion tons of methane, and a billion tons of carbon monoxide; all three are powerful greenhouse gases. The impact also vaporized anhydrite rock, which blasted ten trillion tons of sulfur compounds aloft. The sulfur combined with water to form sulfuric acid, which then fell as an acid rain that may have been potent enough to strip the leaves from any surviving plants and to leach the nutrients from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the layer of debris, ash, and soot deposited by the asteroid strike is preserved in the Earth’s sediment as a stripe of black about the thickness of a notebook. This is called the KT boundary, because it marks the dividing line between the Cretaceous period and the Tertiary period. (The Tertiary has been redefined as the Paleogene, but the term “KT” persists.) Mysteries abound above and below the KT layer. In the late Cretaceous, widespread volcanoes spewed vast quantities of gas and dust into the atmosphere, and the air contained far higher levels of carbon dioxide than the air that we breathe now. The climate was tropical, and the planet was perhaps entirely free of ice. Yet scientists know very little about the animals and plants that were living at the time, and as a result they have been searching for fossil deposits as close to the KT boundary as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the central mysteries of paleontology is the so-called “three-­metre problem.” In a century and a half of assiduous searching, almost no dinosaur remains have been found in the layers three metres, or about nine feet, below the KT boundary, a depth representing many thousands of years. Consequently, numerous paleontologists have argued that the dinosaurs were on the way to extinction long before the asteroid struck, owing perhaps to the volcanic eruptions and climate change. Other scientists have countered that the three-metre problem merely reflects how hard it is to find fossils. Sooner or later, they’ve contended, a scientist will discover dinosaurs much closer to the moment of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locked in the KT boundary are the answers to our questions about one of the most significant events in the history of life on the planet. If one looks at the Earth as a kind of living organism, as many biologists do, you could say that it was shot by a bullet and almost died. Deciphering what happened on the day of destruction is crucial not only to solving the three-­metre problem but also to explaining our own genesis as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 5, 2013, I received an e-mail from a graduate student named Robert DePalma. I had never met DePalma, but we had corresponded on paleontological matters for years, ever since he had read a novel I’d written that centered on the discovery of a fossilized &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; killed by the KT impact. “I have made an incredible and unprecedented discovery,” he wrote me, from a truck stop in Bowman, North Dakota. “It is extremely confidential and only three others know of it at the moment, all of them close colleagues.” He went on, “It is far more unique and far rarer than any simple dinosaur discovery. I would prefer not outlining the details via e-mail, if possible.” He gave me his cell-phone number and a time to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called, and he told me that he had discovered a site like the one I’d imagined in my novel, which contained, among other things, direct victims of the catastrophe. At first, I was skeptical. DePalma was a scientific nobody, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Kansas, and he said that he had found the site with no institutional backing and no collaborators. I thought that he was likely exaggerating, or that he might even be crazy. (Paleontology has more than its share of unusual people.) But I was intrigued enough to get on a plane to North Dakota to see for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s find was in the Hell Creek geological formation, which outcrops in parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, and contains some of the most storied dinosaur beds in the world. At the time of the impact, the Hell Creek landscape consisted of steamy, subtropical lowlands and floodplains along the shores of an inland sea. The land teemed with life and the conditions were excellent for fossilization, with seasonal floods and meandering rivers that rapidly buried dead animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinosaur hunters first discovered these rich fossil beds in the late nineteenth century. In 1902, Barnum Brown, a flamboyant dinosaur hunter who worked at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, found the first &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; here, causing a worldwide sensation. One paleontologist estimated that in the Cretaceous period Hell Creek was so thick with &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rexes&lt;/em&gt; that they were like hyenas on the Serengeti. It was also home to triceratops and duckbills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hell Creek Formation spanned the Cretaceous and the Paleogene periods, and paleontologists had known for at least half a century that an extinction had occurred then, because dinosaurs were found below, but never above, the KT layer. This was true not only in Hell Creek but all over the world. For many years, scientists believed that the KT extinction was no great mystery: over millions of years, volcanism, climate change, and other events gradually killed off many forms of life. But, in the late nineteen-seventies, a young geologist named Walter Alvarez and his father, Luis Alvarez, a nuclear physicist, discovered that the KT layer was laced with unusually high amounts of the rare metal iridium, which, they hypothesized, was from the dusty remains of an asteroid impact. In an article in &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1980, they proposed that this impact was so large that it triggered the mass extinction, and that the KT layer was the debris from that event. Most paleontologists rejected the idea that a sudden, random encounter with space junk had drastically altered the evolution of life on Earth. But as the years passed the evidence mounted, until, in a 1991 paper, the smoking gun was announced: the discovery of an impact crater buried under thousands of feet of sediment in the Yucatán peninsula, of exactly the right age, and of the right size and geochemistry, to have caused a worldwide cataclysm. The crater and the asteroid were named Chicxulub, after a small Mayan town near the epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the authors of the 1991 paper, David Kring, was so frightened by what he learned of the impact’s destructive nature that he became a leading voice in calling for a system to identify and neutralize threatening asteroids. “There’s no uncertainty to this statement: the Earth will be hit by a Chicxulub-size asteroid again, unless we deflect it,” he told me. “Even a three-hundred-metre rock would end world agriculture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, forty-one researchers in many scientific disciplines announced, in a landmark &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, that the issue should be considered settled: a huge asteroid impact caused the extinction. But opposition to the idea remains passionate. The main competing hypothesis is that the colossal “Deccan” volcanic eruptions, in what would become India, spewed enough sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to cause a climatic shift. The eruptions, which began before the KT impact and continued after it, were among the biggest in Earth’s history, lasting hundreds of thousands of years, and burying half a million square miles of the Earth’s surface a mile deep in lava. The three-­metre gap below the KT layer, proponents argued, was evidence that the mass extinction was well under way by the time of the asteroid strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;85&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, DePalma, at the time a twenty-­two-year-old paleontology undergraduate, began excavating a small site in the Hell Creek Formation. The site had once been a pond, and the deposit consisted of very thin layers of sediment. Normally, one geological layer might represent thousands or millions of years. But DePalma was able to show that each layer in the deposit had been laid down in a single big rainstorm. “We could see when there were buds on the trees,” he told me. “We could see when the cypresses were dropping their needles in the fall. We could experience this in real time.” Peering at the layers was like flipping through a paleo-history book that chronicled decades of ecology in its silty pages. DePalma’s adviser, the late Larry Martin, urged him to find a similar site, but one that had layers closer to the KT boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, DePalma, now thirty-seven, is still working toward his Ph.D. He holds the unpaid position of curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History, a nascent and struggling museum with no exhibition space. In 2012, while looking for a new pond deposit, he heard that a private collector had stumbled upon an unusual site on a cattle ranch near Bowman, North Dakota. (Much of the Hell Creek land is privately owned, and ranchers will sell digging rights to whoever will pay decent money, paleontologists and commercial fossil collectors alike.) The collector felt that the site, a three-foot-deep layer exposed at the surface, was a bust: it was packed with fish fossils, but they were so delicate that they crumbled into tiny flakes as soon as they met the air. The fish were encased in layers of damp, cracked mud and sand that had never solidified; it was so soft that it could be dug with a shovel or pulled apart by hand. In July, 2012, the collector showed DePalma the site and told him that he was welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was immediately very disappointed,” DePalma told me. He was hoping for a site like the one he’d excavated earlier: an ancient pond with fine-grained, fossil-bearing layers that spanned many seasons and years. Instead, everything had been deposited in a single flood. But as DePalma poked around he saw potential. The flood had entombed everything immediately, so specimens were exquisitely preserved. He found many complete fish, which are rare in the Hell Creek Formation, and he figured that he could remove them intact if he worked with painstaking care. He agreed to pay the rancher a certain amount for each season that he worked there. (The specifics of the arrangement, as is standard practice in paleontology, are a closely guarded secret. The site is now under exclusive long-term lease.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following July, DePalma returned to do a preliminary excavation of the site. “Almost right away, I saw it was unusual,” he told me. He began shovelling off the layers of soil above where he’d found the fish. This “overburden” is typically material that was deposited long after the specimen lived; there’s little in it to interest a paleontologist, and it is usually discarded. But as soon as DePalma started digging he noticed grayish-white specks in the layers which looked like grains of sand but which, under a hand lens, proved to be tiny spheres and elongated ­droplets. “I think, Holy shit, these look like microtektites!” DePalma recalled. Micro­tektites are the blobs of glass that form when molten rock is blasted into the air by an asteroid impact and falls back to Earth in a solidifying drizzle. The site appeared to contain micro­tektites by the million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DePalma carefully excavated the upper layers, he began uncovering an extraordinary array of fossils, exceedingly delicate but marvellously well preserved. “There’s amazing plant material in there, all interlaced and interlocked,” he recalled. “There are logjams of wood, fish pressed against cypress-­tree root bundles, tree trunks smeared with amber.” Most fossils end up being squashed flat by the pressure of the overlying stone, but here everything was three-dimensional, including the fish, having been encased in sediment all at once, which acted as a support. “You see skin, you see dorsal fins literally sticking straight up in the sediments, species new to science,” he said. As he dug, the momentousness of what he had come across slowly dawned on him. If the site was what he hoped, he had made the most important paleontological discovery of the new century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DePalma grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, and as a child he was fascinated by bones and the stories they contained. His father, Robert, Sr., practices endodontic surgery in nearby Delray Beach; his great-uncle Anthony, who died in 2005, at the age of a hundred, was a renowned orthopedic surgeon who wrote several standard textbooks on the subject. (Anthony’s son, Robert’s cousin, is the film director Brian De Palma.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between the ages of three and four, I made a visual connection with the gracefulness of individual bones and how they fit together as a system,” DePalma told me. “That really struck me. I went after whatever on the dinner table had bones in it.” His family ­buried their dead pets in one spot and put the burial markers in another, so that he wouldn’t dig up the corpses; he found them anyway. He froze dead lizards in ice-cube trays, which his mother would discover when she had friends over for iced tea. “I was never into sports,” he said. “They tried to get me to do that so I would get along with the other kids. But I was digging up the baseball field looking for bones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s great-uncle Anthony, who lived in Pompano Beach, took him under his wing. “I used to visit him every other weekend and show him my latest finds,” DePalma said. When he was four, someone at a museum in Texas gave him a fragment of dinosaur bone, which he took to his great-uncle. “He taught me that all those little knobs and rough patches and protrusions on a bone had names, and that the bone also had a name,” DePalma said. “I was captivated.” At six or seven, on trips to Central Florida with his family, he started finding his own fossilized bones from mammals dating back to the Ice Age. He found his first dinosaur bone when he was nine, in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, during the summer and on weekends, DePalma collected fossils, made dinosaur models, and mounted skeletons for the Graves Museum of Archaeology and Natural History, in Dania Beach. He loaned the museum his childhood fossil collection for display, but in 2004 the museum went bankrupt and many of the specimens were carted off to a community college. DePalma had no paperwork to prove his ownership, and a court refused to return his fossils, which numbered in the hundreds. They were mostly locked away in storage, unavailable for public display and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismayed by what he called the “wasteful mismanagement” of his collection, DePalma adopted some unusual collecting practices. Typically, paleontologists cede the curation and the care of their specimens to the institutions that hold them. But DePalma insists on contractual clauses that give him oversight of the management of his specimens. He never digs on public land, because of what he considers excessive government red tape. But, without federal support for his work, he must cover almost all the costs himself. His out-of-pocket expenses for working the Hell Creek site amount to tens of thousands of dollars. He helps defray the expenses by mounting fossils, doing reconstructions, and casting and selling replicas for museums, private collectors, and other clients. At times, his parents have chipped in. “I squeak by,” he said. “If it’s a ­tossup between getting more PaleoBond”—an expensive liquid glue used to hold fossils together—“or changing the air-conditioning filter, I’m getting the PaleoBond.” He is single, and shares a three-bedroom apartment with casts of various dinosaurs, including one of a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nanotyrannus&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s hard to have a life outside of my work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s control of his research collection is controversial. Fossils are a big business; wealthy collectors pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, for a rare specimen. (In 1997, a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; nicknamed Sue was sold at a Sotheby’s auction, to the Field Museum of Natural History, in Chicago, for more than $8.3 million.) The American market is awash in fossils illegally smuggled out of China and Mongolia. But in the U.S. fossil collecting on private property is legal, as is the buying, selling, and exporting of fossils. Many scientists view this trade as a threat to paleontology and argue that important fossils belong in museums. “I’m not allowed to have a private collection of anything I’m studying,” one prominent curator told me. DePalma insists that he maintains “the best of both worlds” for his fossils. He has deposited portions of his collection at several nonprofit institutions, including the University of Kansas, the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History, and Florida Atlantic University; some specimens are temporarily housed in various analytical labs that are conducting tests on them—all overseen by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, DePalma briefly made news with a paper he published in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. Four years earlier, in Hell Creek, he and a field assistant, Robert Feeney, found an odd, lumpy growth of fossilized bone that turned out to be two fused vertebrae from the tail of a hadrosaur, a duck-billed dinosaur from the Cretaceous period. DePalma thought that the bone might have grown around a foreign object and encased it. He took it to Lawrence Memorial Hospital, in Kansas, where a CT technician scanned it for free in the middle of the night, when the machine was idle. Inside the nodule was a broken tyrannosaur tooth; the hadrosaur had been bitten by a tyrannosaur and escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery helped refute an old hypothesis, revived by the formidable paleontologist Jack Horner, that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; was solely a scavenger. Horner argued that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; was too slow and lumbering, its arms too puny and its eyesight too poor, to prey on other creatures. When DePalma’s find was picked up by the national media, Horner dismissed it as “speculation” and merely “one data point.” He suggested an alternative scenario: the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; might have accidentally bitten the tail of a sleeping hadrosaur, thinking that it was dead, and then “backed away” when it realized its mistake. “I thought that was absolutely preposterous,” DePalma told me. At the time, he told the Los Angeles &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, “A scavenger doesn’t come across a food source and realize all of a sudden that it’s alive.” Horner eventually conceded that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; may have hunted live prey. But, when I asked Horner about DePalma recently, he said at first that he didn’t remember him: “In the community, we don’t get to know students very well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without his Ph.D., DePalma remains mostly invisible, awaiting the stamp of approval that signals the beginning of a serious research career. Several paleontologists I talked to had not heard of him. Another, who asked not to be named, said, “Finding that kind of fossil was pretty cool, but not life-­changing. People sometimes think I’m dumb because I often say I don’t have the answers—we weren’t there when a fossil was formed. There are other people out there who say they do know, and he’s one of those people. I think he can overinterpret.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;140&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving DePalma’s e-mail, I made arrangements to visit the Hell Creek site; three weeks later I was in Bowman. DePalma pulled up to my hotel in a Toyota 4Runner, its stereo blasting the theme to “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” He wore a coarse cotton work shirt, cargo pants with canvas ­suspenders, and a suède cowboy hat with the left brim snapped up. His face was tanned from long days in the sun and he had a five-day-old beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in, and we drove for an hour or so, turning through a ranch gate and following a maze of bone-rattling roads that eventually petered out in a grassy basin. The scattered badlands of Hell Creek form an otherworldly landscape. This is far-flung ranching and farming country; prairies and sunflower fields stretch to the horizon, domed by the great blue skies of the American West. Roads connect small towns—truck stop, church, motel, houses and trailers—and lonely expanses roll by in between. Here and there in the countryside, abandoned farmhouses lean into the ground. Over millions of years, the Hell Creek layer has been heavily eroded, leaving only remnants, which jut from the prairie like so many rotten teeth. These lifeless buttes and pinnacles are striped in beige, chocolate, yellow, maroon, russet, gray, and white. Fossils, worked loose by wind and rain, spill down the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, DePalma’s site lay open in front of us: a desolate hump of gray, cracked earth, about the size of two soccer fields. It looked as if a piece of the moon had dropped there. One side of the deposit was cut through by a sandy wash, or dry streambed; the other ended in a low escarpment. The dig was a three-foot-deep rectangular hole, sixty feet long by forty feet wide. A couple of two-by-fours, along with various digging tools and some metal pipe for taking core samples, leaned against the far side of the hole. As we strolled around the site, I noticed on DePalma’s belt a long fixed-blade knife and a sheathed bayonet—a Second World War relic that his uncle gave him when he was twelve, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled the moment of discovery. The first fossil he removed, earlier that summer, was a five-foot-long freshwater paddlefish. Paddlefish still live today; they have a long bony snout, with which they probe murky water in search of food. When DePalma took out the fossil, he found underneath it a tooth from a mosasaur, a giant carnivorous marine reptile. He wondered how a freshwater fish and a marine reptile could have ended up in the same place, on a riverbank at least several miles inland from the nearest sea. (At the time, a shallow body of water, called the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the proto-­Gulf of Mexico up through part of North America.) The next day, he found a two-foot-wide tail from another marine fish; it looked as if it had been violently ripped from the fish’s body. “If the fish is dead for any length of time, those tails decay and fall apart,” DePalma said. But this one was perfectly intact, “so I knew that it was transported at the time of death or around then.” Like the mosasaur tooth, it had somehow ended up miles inland from the sea of its origin. “When I found that, I thought, There’s no way, this can’t be right,” DePalma said. The discoveries hinted at an extraordinary conclusion that he wasn’t quite ready to accept. “I was ninety-eight per cent con­vinced at that point,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, DePalma noticed a small disturbance preserved in the sediment. About three inches in diameter, it appeared to be a crater formed by an object that had fallen from the sky and plunked down in mud. Similar formations, caused by hailstones hitting a muddy surface, had been found before in the fossil record. As DePalma shaved back the layers to make a cross-­section of the crater, he found the thing itself—not a hailstone but a small white sphere—at the bottom of the crater. It was a tektite, about three millimetres in diameter—the fallout from an ancient asteroid impact. As he continued excavating, he found another crater with a tektite at the bottom, and another, and another. Glass turns to clay over millions of years, and these tektites were now clay, but some still had glassy cores. The microtektites he had found earlier might have been carried there by water, but these had been trapped where they fell—on what, DePalma believed, must have been the very day of the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I saw that, I knew this wasn’t just any flood deposit,” DePalma said. “We weren’t just near the KT boundary—this whole site &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the KT boundary!” From surveying and mapping the layers, DePalma hypothesized that a massive inland surge of water flooded a river valley and filled the low-lying area where we now stood, perhaps as a result of the KT-impact tsunami, which had roared across the proto-Gulf and up the Western Interior Seaway. As the water slowed and became slack, it deposited everything that had been caught up in its travels—the heaviest material first, up to whatever was floating on the surface. All of it was quickly entombed and preserved in the muck: dying and dead creatures, both marine and freshwater; plants, seeds, tree trunks, roots, cones, pine needles, flowers, and pollen; shells, bones, teeth, and eggs; tektites, shocked minerals, tiny diamonds, iridium-laden dust, ash, charcoal, and amber-smeared wood. As the sediments settled, blobs of glass rained into the mud, the largest first, then finer and finer bits, until grains sifted down like snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have the whole KT event preserved in these sediments,” DePalma said. “With this deposit, we can chart what happened the day the Cretaceous died.” No paleontological site remotely like it had ever been found, and, if DePalma’s hypothesis proves correct, the scientific value of the site will be immense. When Walter Alvarez visited the dig last summer, he was astounded. “It is truly a magnificent site,” he wrote to me, adding that it’s “surely one of the best sites ever found for telling just what happened on the day of the impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;289&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When DePalma finished showing me the dig, he introduced me to a field assistant, Rudy Pascucci, the director of the Palm Beach Museum. Pascucci, a muscular man in his fifties, was sunburned and unshaven, and wore a sleeveless T-shirt, snakeproof camouflage boots, and a dusty Tilley hat. The two men gathered their tools, got down on the floor of the hole, and began probing the three-foot-high walls of the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rough digging, DePalma likes to use his bayonet and a handheld Marsh pick, popularized by the nineteenth-­century Yale paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, who pioneered dinosaur-hunting in the American West and dis­covered eighty new species. The pick was given to him by David Burnham, his thesis adviser at Kansas, when he completed his master’s degree. For fine work, DePalma uses X-Acto knives and brushes—the typical tools of a paleontologist—as well as dental instruments given to him by his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit consisted of dozens of thin layers of mud and sand. Lower down, it graded into a more turbulent band of sand and gravel, which contained the heavier fish fossils, bones, and bigger tektites. Below that layer was a hard surface of sandstone, the original Cretaceous bedrock of the site, much of which had been scoured smooth by the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontology is maddening work, its progress typically measured in millimetres. As I watched, DePalma and Pascucci lay on their stomachs under the beating sun, their eyes inches from the dirt wall, and picked away. DePalma poked the tip of an X-Acto into the thin laminations of sediment and loosened one dime-size flake at a time; he’d examine it closely, and, if he saw nothing, flick it away. When the chips accumulated, he gathered them into small piles with a paintbrush; when those piles accumulated, Pascucci swept them into larger piles with a broom and then shovelled them into a heap at the far end of the dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, DePalma came across small plant fossils—flower petals, leaves, seeds, pine needles, and bits of bark. Many of these were mere impressions in the mud, which would crack and peel as soon as they were exposed to the air. He quickly squirted them with PaleoBond, which soaked into the fossils and held them together. Or, us­ing another technique, he mixed a batch of plaster and poured it on the spec­imen before it fell apart. This would preserve, in plaster, a reverse image of the fossil; the original was too short-lived to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mosquitoes got bad, DePalma took out a briar pipe and packed it with Royal Cherry Cavendish tobacco. He put a lighter to it and vigorously puffed, wreathing himself in sickly-­sweet smoke, then went back to work. “I’m like a shopaholic in a shoe store,” he said. “I want everything!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed me the impression of a round object about two inches wide. “This is either a flower or an echinoderm,” he said, referring to a group of marine life-forms that includes sea urchins and starfish. “I’ll figure it out in the lab.” He swiftly entombed it in Paleo­Bond and plaster. Next, he found a perfect leaf, and near that a seed from a pinecone. “Cretaceous mulch,” he said, dismissively; he already had many similar examples. He found three more small craters with tektites in them, which he sectioned and photographed. Then his X-Acto blade turned up a tiny brown bone—a jaw, less than a quarter inch in length. He held it up between his fingers and peered at it with a lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A mammal,” he said. “This one was already dead when it was buried.” Weeks later, in the lab, he identified the jaw as probably belonging to a mam­mal distantly related to primates—including us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, DePalma discovered a large feather. “Every day is Christmas out here,” he said. He exposed the feather with precise movements. It was a crisp impression in the layer of mud, perhaps thirteen inches long. “This is my ninth feather,” he said. “The first fossil feathers ever found at Hell Creek. I’m convinced these are dinosaur feathers. I don’t know for sure. But these are primitive feathers, and most are a foot long. There are zero birds that big from Hell Creek with feathers this primitive. It’s more parsimonious to suggest it was a known dinosaur, most likely a theropod, possibly a raptor.” He kept digging. “Maybe we’ll find the raptor that these feathers came from, but I doubt it. These feathers could have floated from a long way off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His X-Acto knife unearthed the edge of a fossilized fin. Another paddlefish came to light; it later proved to be nearly six feet long. DePalma probed the sediment around it, to gauge its position and how best to extract it. As more of it was exposed, we could clearly see that the fish’s two-foot-long snout had broken when it was forced—probably by the flood’s surge—against the branches of a submerged araucaria tree. He noted that every fish he’d found in the site had died with its mouth open, which may indicate that the fish had been gasping as they suffocated in the sediment-laden water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most died in a vertical position in the sediment, didn’t even tip over on their sides,” he said. “And they weren’t scavenged, because whatever would have dug them up afterward was probably gone.” He chipped away around the paddlefish, exposing a fin bone, then a half-dollar-size patch of fossilized skin with the scales perfectly visible. He treated these by saturating them with his own special blend of hardener. Because of the extreme fragility of the fossils, he would take them back to his lab, in Florida, totally encased in sediment, or “matrix.” In the lab, he would free each fossil under a magnifying glass, in precisely controlled conditions, away from the damaging effects of sun, wind, and aridity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DePalma worked around the paddlefish, more of the araucaria branch came to light, including its short, spiky needles. “This tree was alive when it was buried,” he said. Then he noticed a golden blob of amber stuck to the branch. Amber is preserved tree resin and often contains traces of whatever was in the air at the time, trapping the atmospheric chemistry and even, sometimes, insects and small reptiles. “This is Cretaceous flypaper,” he said. “I can’t wait to get this back to the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, he had chiselled all the way around the fish, leaving it encased in matrix, supported by a four-inch-tall pedestal of rock. “I’m pretty sure this is a species new to science,” he said. Because the soft tissue had also fossilized, he said, even the animal’s stomach contents might still be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He straightened up. “Time to plaster,” he said. He took off his shirt and began mixing a five-gallon bucket of plaster with his hands, while Pascucci tore strips of burlap. DePalma took a two-by-four and sawed off two foot-long pieces and placed them like splints on either side of the sediment-encased fossil. One by one, he dipped the burlap strips in the plaster and draped them across the top and the sides of the specimen. He added rope handles and plastered them in. An hour later, when the plaster had cured, he chiselled through the rock pedestal beneath the fossil and flipped the specimen over, leaving the underside exposed. Back in the lab, he would go through this surface to access the fossil, with the plaster jacket acting as a cradle below. Using the rope handles, DePalma and Pascucci lugged the specimen, which weighed perhaps two hundred pounds, to the truck and loaded it into the back. Later, DePalma would store it behind a friend’s ranch house, where all his jacketed fossils from the season were laid out in rows, covered with tarps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma resumed digging. Gusts of wind stirred up clouds of dust, and rain fell; when the weather cleared, the late-afternoon sun spilled across the prairie. DePalma was lost in another day, in another time. “Here’s a piece of wood with bark-beetle traces,” he said. Plant fossils from the first several million years after the impact show almost no signs of such damage; the insects were mostly gone. The asteroid had likely struck in the fall, DePalma speculated. He had reached this conclusion by comparing the juvenile paddlefish and sturgeon he’d found with the species’ known growth rates and hatching seasons; he’d also found the seeds of conifers, figs, and certain flowers. “When we analyze the pollen and diatomaceous particles, that will narrow it down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week that followed, fresh riches emerged: more feathers, leaves, seeds, and amber, along with several other fish, three to five feet long, and a dozen more craters with tektites. I have visited many paleontological sites, but I had never seen so many specimens found so quickly. Most digs are boring; days or weeks may pass with little found. DePalma seemed to make a noteworthy discovery about every half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When DePalma first visited the site, he noted, partially embedded on the surface, the hip bone of a dinosaur in the ceratopsian family, of which triceratops is the best-known member. A commercial collector had tried to remove it years earlier; it had been abandoned in place and was crumbling from years of exposure. DePalma initially dismissed it as “trash” and decried the irresponsibility of the collector. Later, though, he wondered how the bone, which was heavy, had arrived there, very close to the high-water mark of the flood. It must have floated, he said, and to have done so it must have been encased in desiccated tissue—suggesting that at least one dinosaur species was alive at the time of the impact. He later found a suitcase-size piece of fossilized skin from a ceratopsian attached to the hip bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, DePalma set off to photograph the layers of the deposit which had been cut through and exposed by the sandy wash. He scraped smooth a vertical section and misted it with water from a spray bottle to bring out the color. The bottom layer was jumbled; the first rush of water had ripped up layers of mud, gravel, and rocks and tumbled them about with pieces of burned (and burning) wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then DePalma came to a faint jug-shaped outline in the wall of the wash. He examined it closely. It started as a tunnel at the top of the KT layer, went down, and then widened into a round cavity, filled with soil of a different color, which stopped at the hard sandstone of the undisturbed bedrock layer below. It looked as though a small animal had dug through the mud to create a hideout. “Is that a burrow?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma scraped the area smooth with his bayonet, then sprayed it. “You’re darn right it is,” he said. “And this isn’t the burrow of a small dinosaur. It’s a mammal burrow.” (Burrows have characteristic shapes, depending on the species that inhabit them.) He peered at it, his eyes inches from the rock, probing it with the tip of the bayonet. “Gosh, I think it’s still in there!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He planned to remove the entire burrow intact, in a block, and run it through a CT scanner back home, to see what it contained. “Any Cretaceous mammal burrow is incredibly rare,” he said. “But this one is impossible—it’s dug right through the KT boundary.” Perhaps, he said, the mammal survived the impact and the flood, burrowed into the mud to escape the freezing darkness, then died. “It may have been born in the Cretaceous and died in the Paleocene,” he said. “And to think—sixty-­six million years later, a stinky monkey is digging it up, trying to figure out what happened.” He added, “If it’s a new species, I’ll name it after you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left Hell Creek, DePalma pressed me on the need for secrecy: I was to tell no one, not even close friends, about what he’d found. The history of paleontology is full of tales of bribery, backstabbing, and double-­dealing. In the nineteenth century, ­Othniel C. Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, the nation’s two leading paleontologists, engaged in a bitter competition to collect dinosaur fossils in the American West. They raided each other’s quarries, bribed each other’s crews, and vilified each other in print and at scientific meetings. In 1890, the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; began a series of sensational articles about the controversy with the headline “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Scientists Wage Bitter Warfare.&lt;/em&gt;” The rivalry has since become known as the Bone Wars. The days of skulduggery in paleontology have not passed; DePalma was deeply concerned that the site would be expropriated by a major museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;167&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma knew that a screwup with this site would probably end his career, and that his status in the field was so uncertain that he needed to fortify the find against potential criticism. He had already experienced harsh judgment when, in 2015, he published a paper on a new species of dinosaur called a Dakotaraptor, and mistakenly inserted a fossil turtle bone in the reconstruction. Although rebuilding a skeleton from thousands of bone fragments that have commingled with those of other species is not easy, DePalma was mor­tified by the attacks. “I never want to go through that again,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For five years, DePalma continued excavations at the site. He quietly shared his findings with a half-dozen luminaries in the field of KT studies, including Walter Alvarez, and enlisted their help. During the winter months, when not in the field, DePalma prepared and analyzed his specimens, a few at a time, in a colleague’s lab at Florida Atlantic University, in Boca Raton. The lab was a windowless, wedge­like room in the geology building, lined with bubbling aquarium tanks and shelves heaped with books, scientific journals, pieces of coral, mastodon teeth, seashells, and a stack of .50-­calibre machine-gun rounds, dating from the Second World War, that the lab’s owner had recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. DePalma had carved out a space for himself in a corner, just large enough for him to work on one or two jacketed fossils at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first visited the lab, in April, 2014, a block of stone three feet long by eighteen inches wide lay on a table under bright lights and a large magnifying lens. The block, DePalma said, contained a sturgeon and a paddlefish, along with dozens of smaller fossils and a single small, perfect crater with a tektite in it. The lower parts of the block consisted of debris, fragments of bone, and loose tektites that had been dislodged and caught up in the turbulence. The block told the story of the impact in microcosm. “It was a very bad day,” DePalma said. “Look at these two fish.” He showed me where the sturgeon’s scutes—the sharp, bony plates on its back—had been forced into the body of the paddlefish. One fish was impaled on the other. The mouth of the paddlefish was agape, and jammed into its gill rakers were microtektites—sucked in by the fish as it tried to breathe. DePalma said, “This fish was likely alive for some time after being caught in the wave, long enough to gasp frenzied mouthfuls of water in a vain attempt to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, DePalma was piecing together a potential picture of the disaster. By the time the site flooded, the surrounding forest was already on fire, given the abundance of charcoal, charred wood, and amber he’d found at the site. The water arrived not as a curling wave but as a powerful, roiling rise, packed with disoriented fish and plant and animal debris, which, DePalma hypothesized, were laid down as the water slowed and receded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lab, DePalma showed me magnified cross-sections of the sediment. Most of its layers were horizontal, but a few formed curlicues or flamelike patterns called truncated flame structures, which were caused by a combination of weight from above and mini-surges in the incoming water. DePalma found five sets of these patterns. He turned back to the block on his table and held a magnifying lens up to the tektite. Parallel, streaming lines were visible on its surface—Schlieren lines, formed by two types of molten glass swirling together as the blobs arced through the atmosphere. Peering through the lens, DePalma picked away at the block with a dental probe. He soon exposed a section of pink, pearlescent shell, which had been pushed up against the sturgeon. “Ammonite,” he said. Ammonites were marine mollusks that somewhat resemble the present-day nautilus, although they were more closely related to squid and octopi. As DePalma uncovered more of the shell, I watched its vibrant color fade. “Live ammonite, ripped apart by the tsunami—they don’t travel well,” he said. “Genus &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sphenodiscus&lt;/em&gt;, I would think.” The shell, which hadn’t previously been documented in the Hell Creek Formation, was another marine victim tossed inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up. “Now I’m going to show you something special,” he said, opening a wooden crate and removing an object that was covered in aluminum foil. He unwrapped a sixteen-inch fossil feather, and held it in his palms like a piece of Lalique glass. “When I found the first feather, I had about twenty seconds of disbelief,” he said. DePalma had studied under Larry Martin, a world authority on the Cretaceous predecessors of birds, and had been “exposed to a lot of fossil feathers. When I encountered this damn thing, I immediately understood the importance of it. And now look at this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the lab table, he grabbed a fossil forearm belonging to Dakotaraptor, the dinosaur species he’d discovered in Hell Creek. He pointed to a series of regular bumps on the bone. “These are probably quill knobs,” he said. “This dinosaur had feathers on its forearms. Now watch.” With precision calipers, he measured the diameter of the quill knobs, then the diameter of the quill of the fossil feather; both were 3.5 millimetres. “This matches,” he said. “This says a feather of this size would be associated with a limb of this size.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more, including a piece of a partly burned tree trunk with am­ber stuck to it. He showed me a photo of the amber seen through a micro­scope. Trapped inside were two impact particles—another landmark discovery, because the amber would have preserved their chemical composition. (All other tektites found from the impact, exposed to the elements for millions of years, have chemically changed.) He’d also found scores of beautiful examples of lonsdaleite, a hexagonal form of diamond that is associated with impacts; it forms when carbon in an asteroid is compressed so violently that it crystallizes into trillions of microscopic grains, which are blasted into the air and drift down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he showed me a photograph of a fossil jawbone; it belonged to the mammal he’d found in the burrow. “This is the jaw of Dougie,” he said. The bone was big for a Cretaceous mammal—three inches long—and almost complete, with a tooth. After my visit to Hell Creek, DePalma had removed the animal’s burrow intact, still encased in the block of sediment, and, with the help of some women who worked as cashiers at the Travel Center, in Bowman, hoisted it into the back of his truck. He believes that the jaw belonged to a marsupial that looked like a weasel. Using the tooth, he could conduct a stable-isotope study to find out what the animal ate—“what the menu was after the disaster,” he said. The rest of the mammal remains in the burrow, to be researched later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot;&gt;DePalma says that he’s discovered more than a dozen new species of animals and plants, and identified the broken teeth and bones, including hatchling remains, of almost every dinosaur group known from Hell Creek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;small class=&quot;ImageCaption__credit___rg3mC&quot;&gt;Photograph by Richard Barnes for The New Yorker&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma listed some of the other discoveries he’s made at the site: several flooded ant nests, with drowned ants still inside and some chambers packed with microtektites; a possible wasp burrow; another mammal ­burrow, with multiple tunnels and galleries; shark teeth; the thigh bone of a large sea turtle; at least three new fish species; a gigantic ginkgo leaf and a plant that was a relative of the banana; more than a dozen new species of animals and plants; and several other burrow types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the deposit, in a mixture of heavy gravel and tektites, DePalma identified the broken teeth and bones, including hatchling remains, of almost every dinosaur group known from Hell Creek, as well as pterosaur remains, which had previously been found only in layers far below the KT boundary. He found, intact, an unhatched egg containing an embryo—a fossil of immense research value. The egg and the other remains suggested that dinosaurs and major reptiles were probably not staggering into extinction on that fateful day. In one fell swoop, DePalma may have solved the three-metre problem and filled in the gap in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 2013 field season, DePalma was convinced that the site had been created by an impact flood, but he lacked conclusive evidence that it was the KT impact. It was possible that it resulted from another giant asteroid strike that occurred at around the same time. “Extraordinary discoveries require extraordinary evidence,” he said. If his tektites shared the same geochemistry as tektites from the Chicxulub asteroid, he’d have a strong case. Deposits of Chicxulub tektites are rare; the best source, discovered in 1990, is a small outcrop in Haiti, on a cliff above a road cut. In late January, 2014, DePalma went there to gather tektites and sent them to an independent lab in Canada, along with tektites from his own site; the samples were analyzed at the same time, with the same equipment. The results indicated a near-perfect geochemical match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few years after DePalma’s discoveries, only a handful of scientists knew about them. One was David Burnham, DePalma’s thesis adviser at Kansas, who estimates that DePalma’s site will keep specialists busy for at least half a century. “Robert’s got so much stuff that’s unheard of,” Burnham told me. “Amber with tektites embedded in it—holy cow! The dinosaur feathers are crazy good, but the burrow makes your head reel.” In paleontology, the term &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagerstätte&lt;/em&gt; refers to a rare type of fossil site with a large variety of specimens that are nearly perfectly preserved, a sort of fossilized ecosystem. “It will be a famous site,” Burnham said. “It will be in the textbooks. It is the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagerstätte&lt;/em&gt; of the KT extinction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Smit, a paleontologist at Vrije University, in Amsterdam, and a world authority on the KT impact, has been helping DePalma analyze his results, and, like Burnham and Walter Alvarez, he is a co-author of a scientific paper that DePalma is publishing about the site. (There are eight other co-authors.) “This is really a major discovery,” Smit said. “It solves the question of whether dinosaurs went extinct at exactly that level or whether they declined before. And this is the first time we see direct victims.” I asked if the results would be controversial. “When I saw his data with the paddlefish, sturgeon, and ammonite, I think he’s right on the spot,” Smit said. “I am very sure he has a pot of gold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September of 2016, DePalma gave a brief talk about the discovery at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, in Colorado. He mentioned only that he had found a deposit from a KT flood that had yielded glass droplets, shocked minerals, and fossils. He had christened the site Tanis, after the ancient city in Egypt, which was featured in the 1981 film “Raiders of the Lost Ark” as the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. In the real Tanis, archeologists found an inscription in three writing systems, which, like the Rosetta stone, was crucial in translating ancient Egyptian. DePalma hopes that his Tanis site will help decipher what happened on the first day after the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk, limited though it was, caused a stir. Kirk Cochran, a professor at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at Stony Brook University, in New York, recalled that when DePalma presented his findings there were gasps of amazement in the audience. Some scientists were wary. Kirk Johnson, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, told me that he knew the Hell Creek area well, having worked there since 1981. “My warning lights were flashing bright red,” he told me. “I was so skeptical after the talk I was convinced it was a fabrication.” Johnson, who had been mapping the KT layer in Hell Creek, said that his research indicated that Tanis was at least forty-five feet below the KT boundary and perhaps a hundred thousand years older. “If it’s what it’s said to be,” Johnson said, “it’s a fabulous discovery.” But he declared himself “uneasy” until he could see DePalma’s paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prominent West Coast paleontologist who is an authority on the KT event told me, “I’m suspicious of the findings. They’ve been presented at meetings in various ways with various associated extraordinary claims. He could have stumbled on something amazing, but he has a reputation for making a lot out of a little.” As an example, he brought up DePalma’s paper on Dakotaraptor, which he described as “bones he basically collected, all in one area, some of which were part of a dinosaur, some of which were part of a turtle, and he put it all together as a skeleton of one animal.” He also objected to what he felt was excessive secrecy surrounding the Tanis site, which has made it hard for outside scientists to evaluate DePalma’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, too, finds the lack of transparency, and the dramatic aspects of DePalma’s personality, unnerving. “There’s an element of showmanship in his presentation style that does not add to his credibility,” he said. Other paleontologists told me that they were leery of going on the record with criticisms of DePalma and his co-authors. All expressed a desire to see the final paper, which will be published next week, in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, so that they could evaluate the data for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;90&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the G.S.A. talk, DePalma realized that his theory of what had happened at Tanis had a fundamental problem. The KT tsunami, even moving at more than a hundred miles an hour, would have taken many hours to travel the two thousand miles to the site. The rainfall of glass blobs, however, would have hit the area and stopped within about an hour after the impact. And yet the tektites fell into an active flood. The timing was all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not a paleontological question; it was a problem of geophysics and sedimentology. Smit was a sedimentologist, and another researcher whom DePalma shared his data with, Mark Richards, now of the University of Washington, was a geophysicist. At dinner one evening in Nagpur, India, where they were attending a conference, Smit and Richards talked about the problem, looked up a few papers, and later jotted down some rough calculations. It was immediately apparent to them that the KT tsunami would have arrived too late to capture the falling tektites; the wave would also have been too diminished by its long journey to account for the thirty-­five-foot rise of water at Tanis. One of them proposed that the wave might have been created by a curious phenomenon known as a seiche. In large earthquakes, the shaking of the ground sometimes causes water in ponds, swimming pools, and bathtubs to slosh back and forth. Richards recalled that the 2011 Japanese earthquake produced bizarre, five-foot seiche waves in an absolutely calm Norwegian fjord thirty minutes after the quake, in a place unreachable by the tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richards had previously estimated that the worldwide earthquake generated by the KT impact could have been a thousand times stronger than the biggest earthquake ever experienced in human history. Using that gauge, he calculated that potent seismic waves would have arrived at Tanis six minutes, ten minutes, and thirteen minutes after the impact. (Different types of seismic waves travel at different speeds.) The brutal shaking would have been enough to trigger a large seiche, and the first blobs of glass would have started to rain down seconds or minutes afterward. They would have continued to fall as the seiche waves rolled in and out, depositing layer upon layer of sediment and each time ­sealing the tektites in place. The Tanis site, in short, did not span the first day of the impact: it probably recorded the first hour or so. This fact, if true, renders the site even more fabulous than previously thought. It is almost beyond credibility that a precise geological transcript of the most important sixty minutes of Earth’s history could still exist millions of years later—a sort of high-speed, high-­resolution video of the event recorded in fine layers of stone. DePalma said, “It’s like finding the Holy Grail clutched in the bony fingers of Jimmy Hoffa, sitting on top of the Lost Ark.” If Tanis had been closer to or farther from the impact point, this beautiful coincidence of timing could not have happened. “There’s nothing in the world that’s ever been seen like this,” Richards told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-=-=-=&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day sixty-six million years ago, life on Earth almost came to a shattering end. The world that emerged after the impact was a much simpler place. When sunlight finally broke through the haze, it illuminated a hellish landscape. The oceans were empty. The land was covered with drifting ash. The forests were charred stumps. The cold gave way to extreme heat as a greenhouse effect kicked in. Life mostly consisted of mats of algae and growths of fungus: for years after the impact, the Earth was covered with little other than ferns. Furtive, ratlike mammals lived in the gloomy understory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually life emerged and blossomed again, in new forms. The KT event continues to attract the interest of scientists in no small part because the ashen print it left on the planet is an existential reminder. “We wouldn’t be here talking on the phone if that meteorite hadn’t fallen,” Smit told me, with a laugh. DePalma agreed. For the first hundred million years of their existence, before the asteroid struck, mammals scurried about the feet of the dinosaurs, amounting to little. “But when the dinosaurs were gone it freed them,” DePalma said. In the next epoch, mammals underwent an explosion of adaptive radiation, evolving into a dazzling variety of forms, from tiny bats to gigantic titanotheres, from horses to whales, from fearsome creodonts to large-brained primates with hands that could grasp and minds that could see through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can trace our origins back to that event,” DePalma said. “To actually be there at this site, to see it, to be connected to that day, is a special thing. This is the last day of the Cretaceous. When you go one layer up—the very next day—that’s the Paleocene, that’s the age of mammals, that’s our age.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We moved our servers to Iceland</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;30 Mar 2019 - Adriaan van Rossum - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simpleanalytics/blog.simpleanalytics.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-30-why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland.md&quot;&gt;Help improve this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the founder of Simple Analytics, I have always been mindful for the need of trust and transparency for our customers. We would like to be held accountable for our customers needs, so they can sleep in peace. The choices we make has to be optimal, in terms of privacy, for the visitors and our customers. One of the crucial choices to consider was, choosing the location of our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19526521&quot;&gt;Join the discussion on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/flag-map-of-iceland.svg?v1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we moved our servers gradually to Iceland. In this blog post, I’d like to explain how we’ve achieved that, and most importantly, why. It wasn’t an easy process and I would like to share our learnings. There are some technical parts in this article which I’ve tried to write in an understandable way, but forgive me if it’s too technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-moving-our-servers&quot;&gt;Why moving our servers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with our website being added to &lt;a href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a list with domain names which are used by popular ad-blockers. I asked why Simple Analytics was added because we don’t track visitors of our customers’ websites. We even &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simpleanalytics/cdn.simpleanalytics.io/blob/fae87364ae6dc2e26827fb9438745a8ac0c8024d/hello.js#L41-L42&quot;&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt; the “Do Not Track” settings in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855#issuecomment-440241758&quot;&gt;replied the following&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855&quot;&gt;Pull Request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] So if we keep blocking the companies that do good, and respect the privacy of the users, what kind of sign is it to just block those companies? I think it’s wrong and we shouldn’t put every company on the list just because they are sending a request. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855#issuecomment-440251257&quot;&gt;a reply&lt;/a&gt; to my comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cassowary714&quot;&gt;@cassowary714&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone says what you are saying, but I don’t want to see my requests sent to a US company (in your case, Digital Ocean […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this reply at first, but after sharing it with my community, people pointed it out to me that he indeed was correct about the fact the US government is able to access the data of our users. At that time, our servers were indeed running on Digital Ocean and they could pull out our drive and read our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/safe.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is somewhat technical so bear with me. You can make a stolen drive (or detached for whatever reason) unusable for others. This can be solved by encrypting the data on the drive which makes it very difficult to read the data for people without the encryption key &lt;em&gt;(Note: only Simple Analytics has this key).&lt;/em&gt; It would still be possible to get little parts of the data by physically reading out the memory of the server. Memory is easy explained as a type of a drive, which is small but super fast which allows the processor of the server to run efficiently. A server does not function without memory so we kind of need to trust the hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenged me to think where to move our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-next-location&quot;&gt;Our next location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with some basic searches and I found a Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country#Reporters_Without_Borders&quot;&gt;Internet censorship and surveillance by country&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a list of “Enemies of the Internet” by the Reporters without Borders, a Paris-based international non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of the press, which classifies a country as an enemy of the internet when “all of these countries mark themselves out not just for their capacity to censor news and information online but also for their almost systematic repression of Internet users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this list, there is an alliance called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes&quot;&gt;Five Eyes&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a. FVEY. It’s an alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In recent years, documents have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another’s citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on spying (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_under_Five_Eyes_surveillance#cite_ref-8&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;). The former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, described the FVEY as a “supra-national intelligence organization that doesn’t answer to the laws of its own countries.” There are other countries working together with the FVEY in other international cooperatives including Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden (so-called 14 Eyes). I couldn’t find evidence of the 14 Eyes alliance abusing their combined intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/server-down.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we were pretty sure not to use any of the listed countries from the “Enemies of the Internet” list and just to be sure to skip the countries on the 14 Eyes alliance list. For Simple Analytics, this gave enough reason to avoid those countries for storing the data of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia page earlier mentioned reads the following for Iceland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship is prohibited by the Icelandic Constitution and there is a strong tradition of protecting freedom of expression that extends to the use of the Internet. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iceland&quot;&gt;Iceland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching the best country, privacy-wise, Iceland kept popping up. So I did some thorough research on Iceland. Please keep in mind that I don’t speak Icelandic which may have resulted in missing important information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.io/feedback&quot;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-net-freedom-2018&quot;&gt;Freedom on the Net 2018 report&lt;/a&gt; (from the Freedom House), Iceland together with Estonia scored a 6/100 (lower is better) on the Internet Freedom Score. This makes them the best privacy-friendly countries. Be aware that not every country has been rated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland is not a member of the European Union, although the country is part of the European Economic Area and has agreed to follow legislation regarding consumer protection and business law similar to other member states. This includes the Electronic Communications Act 81/2003 which implemented data retention requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law applies to telecommunication providers and mandates the retention of records for six months. It also states that companies may only deliver information on telecommunications in criminal cases or on matters of public safety and that such information may not be given to anyone other than the police or the public prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, Iceland is somewhat following the laws of the European Economic Area, it has its own approach to privacy. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438&quot;&gt;Icelandic Data Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; encourages anonymity of user data. ISPs and content hosts are not held legally liable for the content that they host or transmit. According to Icelandic law, its not the domain name provider, but the registrant of an .is domain name that is responsible for ensuring the use of the domain is within the limits of the law (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isnic.is/en/domain/rules&quot;&gt;ISNIC&lt;/a&gt;). The government does not place any restrictions on anonymous communication and no registration is required when purchasing a SIM card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/world-line-sf-ams.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage from moving to Iceland is the climate and location of the country. Servers produce a lot of heat and while Reykjavík (Icelands capital where most data centers are located) is on average 40.41°F (4.67°C) it’s a great location to cool down the servers. Meaning that for each watt used to run servers, storage and network equipment, proportionally very little is used for cooling, lighting and other overhead. On top of that Iceland is the world’s largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita, with approximately 55,000 kWh per person per year. In comparison, the EU average is less than 6,000 kWh. Most hosting providers in Iceland get 100% of their electricity from renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you draw a straight line from San Francisco to Amsterdam you will cross Iceland. Simple Analytics has most customers from the US and Europe, so it makes sense to pick this geographical location. The privacy-friendly laws and the environmental friendly approach of Iceland made it even more easy for us to choose them as the new location for our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-our-servers&quot;&gt;Moving our servers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we needed to find a hosting provider in Iceland. There are quite a few and it’s really hard to know if you have the best. We didn’t have the resources to try them all, so instead, we set up some automatic scripts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;) while setting up the server so we could easily move to another provider if we needed to. We choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://1984hosting.com/&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, a company with the slogan “Safeguarding privacy and civil rights since 2006”. We liked that slogan and asked them a few questions about how they would handle our data. They reassured us and we proceeded installing our main server and they only use electricity from renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/server-status.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we hit a few roadblocks during this process. This section of the article is quite technical. Feel free to skip to the next. When you have an encrypted server you’ll need to unlock it with a private key. This key can’t be stored on the server as it defeats the purpose of encrypting. So if the key isn’t on the server you need to enter it remotely. That’s right, we need to enter the key when the server boots. Wait, but what happens with a power failure? Are all requests with page views to your server failing after a reboot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we added an extra server in front of the main server. This server is kind of stupid. It just receives the requests with page views and sends it directly to our main server. When the main server is failing it will store the requests in its own database and re-attemps those requests to the main server until it succeeds. So after a power failure, there is no data loss anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to booting up the server. When the encrypted main server boots we need to enter a password. But we don’t want to travel to Iceland or ask somebody there to enter it, for obvious reasons. To access a server remotely you usually use SSH. SSH - is a secure communication protocol, that most people use to communicate with their servers. SSH is a program which is accessible when a server or computer is running. But we needed it to connect before the server was completely started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html&quot;&gt;Dropbear&lt;/a&gt;, a very small SSH program, that you can run via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk&quot;&gt;initial ramdisk&lt;/a&gt; (initramfs). This means we are able to allow external connections via SSH. We don’t have to fly to Iceland to boot our server, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving our data from our old server to our new server in Iceland we were finally done. It took us a couple of weeks from start to end, but we are glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-storing-the-data-you-need&quot;&gt;Only storing the data you need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Simple Analytics we live by the saying: “Only store data you need.” We only &lt;a href=&quot;http://simpleanalytics.io/what-we-collect&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/a&gt; the minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s common practice to &lt;a href=&quot;http://abstraction.blog/2015/06/28/soft-vs-hard-delete&quot;&gt;soft delete&lt;/a&gt; data in applications. This means that the data is not really deleted but it’s made inaccessible by the end user. We don’t do this, if you delete your data, it’s gone from our database. We use hard delete. &lt;em&gt;Note: it will be in our encrypted backups for a maximum of 90 days. In case of a bug we can retrieve this data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have delete_at fields ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers, it’s important to know what data is kept and what is deleted. When somebody deletes their data we show them &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.io/deleted&quot;&gt;a page with exactly that&lt;/a&gt;. We delete the user and their analytics from our database. We also delete the credit card and email from Stripe (our payment provider). We keep the payment history, which is needed for taxes and keep our log files and database backups for 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/personal-data.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: If you only store little sensitive data, what’s the need for all this protection and extra security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we want to be the best privacy focused analytics company in the world. We will do everything within our power to deliver the best analytics tools without invading the privacy of your visitors. By even protecting our massive amounts of unidentifiable information about visitors we want to show we take privacy super seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-next&quot;&gt;What is next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we improved the privacy of our platform we noticed a slight increase in loading time for our embed scripts. This makes perfect sense, because they were hosted via the CDN of CloudFlare. A CDN is a set of servers around the world to decrease loading times for everybody. We are thinking of setting up a very simple CDN with encrypted servers, which only serve our JavaScript and store the page views temporarily before sending it to our main server in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
